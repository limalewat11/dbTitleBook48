<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Nothing Gold Can Stay: A Liam Campbell Mystery (Liam Campbell Mysteries)</h2><p>Alaska state trooper Liam Campbell is ensnared in a tangled net of violence and evil secrets when he investigates a string of murders at a fishing village.</p><p>Alaska is home to Dana Stabenow's two series protagonists, Kate Shugak and Liam Campbell, as well as to the author herself, who excels at contrasting the vast emptiness of the bush with the close relationships and tangled kinship connections of the Native American and white characters who people her lively thrillers. <i>Nothing Gold Can Stay</i> brings state trooper Liam Campbell back as lead investigator in a string of killings that stretch back through time, along with his colleague Diana Prince, an ambitious young policewoman who's excited about her first assignment after the academy. It also fleshes out Liam's complicated emotional life. Slowly rebuilding his career in the remote fishing village of Newenham after a deadly mishap in which five people were killed (and a devastating personal tragedy that claimed the lives of his wife and young son), he's now happily involved with bush pilot Wy Chouinard. Wy is the adoptive mother of a teenage boy badly abused by the birth mother who's suddenly returned to claim him. Campbell, for his part, finds himself caught up in the seemingly unconnected deaths of a postmistress and a prospector and the search for the latter's wife, who disappeared from the scene of her husband's murder. <p> Stabenow is a talented plotter, who keeps the action going as Liam and Diana close in on the deranged serial killer. She makes the most of her minor characters, especially a charismatic tribal elder who's a martial arts expert, a battered teenage wife, a sexy, 60-ish barkeep, and an unhappy yuppie who'd rather be hunting for bargains at the Anchorage Nordstrom than for gold in the wilds of the bush. Stabenow depicts the unforgiving wilderness of Alaska with the love of a native daughter and the skill of a writer who keeps getting better with every book. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Making Haste from Babylon: The Mayflower Pilgrims and Their World: A New History</h2><p>At the end of 1618, a blazing green star soared across the night sky over the northern hemisphere. From the Philippines to the Arctic, the comet became a sensation and a symbol, a warning of doom or a promise of salvation. Two years later, as the Pilgrims prepared to sail across the Atlantic on board the <i>Mayflower</i>, the atmosphere remained charged with fear and expectation. Men and women readied themselves for war, pestilence, or divine retribution. Against this background, and amid deep economic depression, the Pilgrims conceived their enterprise of exile.<br><br>Within a decade, despite crisis and catastrophe, they built a thriving settlement at New Plymouth, based on beaver fur, corn, and cattle. In doing so, they laid the foundations for Massachusetts, New England, and a new nation. Using a wealth of new evidence from landscape, archaeology, and hundreds of overlooked or neglected documents, Nick Bunker gives a vivid and strikingly original account of the <i>Mayflower</i> project and the first decade of the Plymouth Colony. From mercantile London and the rural England of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I to the mountains and rivers of Maine, he weaves a rich narrative that combines religion, politics, money, science, and the sea.<br><br>The Pilgrims were entrepreneurs as well as evangelicals, political radicals as well as Christian idealists. <i>Making Haste from Babylon</i> tells their story in unrivaled depth, from their roots in religious conflict and village strife at home to their final creation of a permanent foothold in America.</p><p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Author Nick Bunker</strong> <br> <br> <b>Question:</b> What made you, as an Englishman, want to tell the story of the <i>Mayflower</i> Pilgrims?<p></p> <p><b>Nick Bunker:</b> Before they were American, they were English, and a revolutionary war had to be fought before the two nations separated for good. Long after the <i>Mayflower</i>, the history of England and America remained deeply intertwined. You can&#x2019;t understand one without delving into the other as well.</p> <p>In my case there&#x2019;s also a family reason for my fascination with the American past. I&#x2019;m called Bunker. For centuries the Bunkers lived lives of total obscurity, as farmhands and farriers and the like in the countryside northwest of London. Except for one Bunker, a yeoman farmer called George, born in about 1600. It seems that George Bunker became a Puritan and in 1632, he sailed to Massachusetts, most likely on the Lyon, a ship which also supplied the Plymouth Colony. He settled at Charlestown, where he gave his name to Bunker Hill, but George was a free-thinking man who upset the authorities by supporting the religious radical Anne Hutchinson. So they took away his gun, and banned him from holding public office. Even so, he did well. George Bunker became one of the earliest benefactors of Harvard College. His descendants were still living at Charlestown in 1775, when Bunker Hill became a battlefield.</p> <p>You won&#x2019;t find George Bunker in <i>Making Haste from Babylon</i>, but his story wasn&#x2019;t so very different from those of the Pilgrims on the <i>Mayflower</i>. It raises the same kind of questions. Exactly why did they embark on this bold, hazardous project called New England? What did they find when they arrived? How and why did they succeed, so that families like the Bunkers, who&#x2019;d been unknowns in England, came to be entrepreneurs in America, the kind of people you read about in <i>Moby Dick</i>?</p> <p>I find these questions fascinating, but very few Britons have shown any interest in answering them. That&#x2019;s why I decided to write the book. I felt that it was time the story was told from an English perspective, and I guessed that historians had overlooked a mass of relevant material here in the United Kingdom.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> You unearthed an extraordinary number of documents relating to the Pilgrims and the early settlement of New England, most of them virtually untouched. How did you find these records? And what do they reveal?</p> <p><b>Nick Bunker:</b> It&#x2019;s a matter of timing. In the 19th century, when people started to look to the Pilgrim Fathers and the <i>Mayflower</i> as the inventors of America, scholars from New England began to make visits to London in search of archive material that might shed more light upon them. By the time of the tercentenary in 1920, it looked as though every relevant document had been discovered. Since then, many books have appeared about the Plymouth Colony, both academic and popular. But with only one or two exceptions the authors have relied entirely upon sources which were already in print a century ago.</p> Since 1945, record offices in England have made available huge quantities of new material from the Tudor and Stuart period, documents which were previously either hidden away in private hands, unlisted, or too badly damaged for use by scholars. Archivists have sorted out and numbered thousands of loose papers, created new catalogues, undertaken conservation projects, and become far more open and accessible. Of course, only a tiny fraction of their holdings relate to people involved in the settlement of New England. Even so they contain a wealth of relevant detail which simply wasn&#x2019;t available to researchers until quite recently.<p></p> Let&#x2019;s be clear: by itself, no single document will change our view of the <i>Mayflower</i> or New England. What I&#x2019;ve done is to assemble a mosaic of fragments, as carefully as I can, to form a new picture of what happened. I hope it&#x2019;s much clearer than anything exhibited before. I wanted to show exactly how things were: how faith, politics, business and the necessities of physical survival interacted with each other, to produce what we now call Puritan America.<p></p> <p><b>Question:</b> One of the key features of your book is that it places the <i>Mayflower</i> in a new global context, connecting the Pilgrims not only to religion, but to political and economic forces as well. How does this change our understanding of the settlement of North America?</p> <p><b>Nick Bunker:</b> It makes the story richer and deeper, more adult and more inclusive, and it removes the myths and clichï¿½s. </p> The year 1620 was the equivalent, in the seventeenth century, of 1931 in the twentieth. Western Europe was sliding into an economic depression, and the continent was already at war: a war that would last for thirty years and leave millions dead. It was the conflict described by Brecht in his play <i>Mother Courage</i>, set in this same period, when New England was being created. Meryl Streep played the title role in Central Park a few years ago, as the woman who drags her cart from one grim German battlefield to another, while civilization collapses. Her performance was very accurate. In the early seventeenth century, life was very, very hard and getting harder. From the Baltic to the Mediterranean, millions of people were forced to go on the road, moving back and forth in search of something better: not just Puritans but also gypsies, Jews and Irish exiles, and a vast multitude of anonymous peasants, driven off their soil by war, taxes, and bankruptcy.<p></p> So the voyage of the <i>Mayflower</i> was simply the most famous of many migrations, in a world of trauma. If we see it like that, suddenly it ceases to be a quaint children&#x2019;s tale. Instead, the <i>Mayflower</i> becomes a symbol of the experience of migrants of all kinds. Because we can find out much more about the Pilgrims than we can about most of the other exiles and refugees whom I mentioned, their story can be told with rare fidelity and accuracy. But I hope that many other kinds of people can see it as something relevant to their own lineage, even if they&#x2019;re not white Anglo-Saxon Protestants like me and like Bradford. <p></p> <p> (Photo ï¿½ Nick Bunker) </p>A graduate of King&#x2019;s College, Cambridge, with a master&#x2019;s degree from Columbia University, Nick Bunker has had a diverse career in finance and journalism.

Depopulated after the extermination of its original native population, today it&#x2019;s home to nineteen million. The site of vicious racial violence, including massacres, slavery, and the roll-back of Reconstruction, Florida is now one of our most diverse states, a dynamic multicultural place with an essential role in 21st-century America.<br><br>In <i>Finding Florida</i>, journalist T.D. Allman reclaims the remarkable history of Florida from the state&#x2019;s mythologizers, apologists, and boosters. Allman traces the discovery, exploration, and settlement of Florida, its transformation from a swamp to paradise.&#x201d; Palm Beach, Key West, Miami, Tampa, and Orlando boomed, fortunes were won and lost, land was stolen and flipped, and millions arrived.

Almost every county in Florida bears the name of a butcher, a slavedriver, a madman, a scoundrel or a thief, in a state where for half a millennium the governing mandate seems to be Defeat the Truth, Triumph over Reality. T.D. Allman's counter-narrative to all the pretty lies is a scouring hurricane of research, investigation, and soul-cleansing wrath, and I doubt there has ever been a better, or more important, book written about the Sunshine State, the birthplace of imperial hubris, American-style." Bob Shacochis, author of <i>The Immaculate Invasion</i> and <i>The Woman Who Lost Her Soul</i><br><br>"Equal parts social analysis, historical review, and jeremiad, <i>Finding Florida</i> is a passionate, often scathing, and remarkably comprehensive encounter with a confounding, contradictory, and ever-elusive place. If your idea of hell is being chained to a galley oar between a politician and a Chamber of Commerce exec, then you are likely to love this book." Les Standiford, author of <i>Last Train to Paradise</i><br><br> Manuscripts repeatedly find their way into print that ignore the reality of Florida&#x2019;s past and, in so doing, skew our understanding of what Florida has been, what it is now, what it&#x2019;s likely to become, and what that means for everyone. T. D. Allman&#x2019;s book turns all that on its head. It directly challenges the existing historiography with highly intelligent insight and crafting of narrative in a way that permits the reader to immerse himself in a world far from the expected one. <i>Finding Florida</i> is provocative to the point of daring. Thomas Jefferson claimed a little revolution was needed about every twenty years.

While Allman covers an enormous amount of material taking Florida from uninhabited swampland to the sidewalk culture of South Beach he does so in such engaging ways that the reader is never overwhelmed. Indeed, each chapter is in itself a satisfying and illuminating narrative, stock full of vivid characters. Somehow he has managed to pull together a compelling read without sacrificing historical substance, a feat to which many professional historians aspire. His wry voice conveys a point of view that gently pushes readers to understand Florida as an American synecdoche.&#x201d; Glenda Gilmore, Peter V. and C. Vann Woodward Professor of History, Yale University<br><br> Allman provides connections between events, trends, individuals, cultures, geography and geology that all worked to shape Florida&#x2019;s past and our future.

The body of a "glittery bug" is made from a lame-like material; tightly pleated cloth forms the back of a "wrinkly bug"; heart-shaped "velvety bugs" display that plush fabric; etc. Though the tactile surfaces here provide interest (and even the occasional sound effect, as in the candy-wrapper-like paper for "crinkly bugs"), the book's simple format prevents Carter from showing the full range of his antic sensibilities.

In the three years following <i>After Ovid</i>'s publication, Hughes continued working with the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, eventually completing the 24 translations collected here. Culling from 250 original tales, Hughes has chosen some of the most violent and disturbing narratives Ovid wrote, including the stories of Echo and Narcissus, Bacchus and Pentheus, and Semele's rape by Jove. Classical purists may be offended at the occasional liberties Hughes takes with Ovid's words, but no one will quarrel with the force and originality of Hughes's verse, or with its narrative skill. This translation is an unusual triumph--a work informed by the passion and wit of Ovid, yet suffused with Hughes's own distinctive poetic sensibility.<b>Ted Hughes</b> was Poet Laureate of England and the author of many books of poetry.

Pirsig's <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> is a powerful, moving, and penetrating examination of how we live . . . and a breathtaking meditation on how to live better. Here is the book that transformed a generation: an unforgettable narration of a summer motorcycle trip across America's Northwest, undertaken by a father and his young son. A story of love and fear -- of growth, discovery, and acceptance -- that becomes a profound personal and philosophical odyssey into life's fundamental questions, this uniquely exhilarating modern classic is both touching and transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of existence . . . and the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward.</p></p><p>In his now classic <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, Robert Pirsig brings us a literary chautauqua, a novel that is meant to both entertain and edify. It scores high on both counts.<p> Phaedrus, our narrator, takes a present-tense cross-country motorcycle trip with his son during which the maintenance of the motorcycle becomes an illustration of how we can unify the cold, rational realm of technology with the warm, imaginative realm of artistry. As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details--be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle. </p><p> In his autobiographical first novel, Pirsig wrestles both with the ghost of his past and with the most important philosophical questions of the 20th century--why has technology alienated us from our world? what are the limits of rational analysis? if we can't define the good, how can we live it? Unfortunately, while exploring the defects of our philosophical heritage from Socrates and the Sophists to Hume and Kant, Pirsig inexplicably stops at the middle of the 19th century. With the exception of Poincarï¿½, he ignores the more recent philosophers who have tackled his most urgent questions, thinkers such as Peirce, Nietzsche (to whom Phaedrus bears a passing resemblance), Heidegger, Whitehead, Dewey, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn. In the end, the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy. His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers. But in contrast to most other philosophers, Pirsig writes a compelling story. And he is a true innovator in his attempt to popularize a reconciliation of Eastern mindfulness and nonrationalism with Western subject/object dualism. The magic of <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> turns out to lie not in the answers it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them. Like a cross between <i>The Razor's Edge</i> and <i>Sophie's World</i>, <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> takes us into "the high country of the mind" and opens our eyes to vistas of possibility. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>The extraordinary story of a man's quest for truth.

Lingerie, linens, and jewelry, are just a few of the things a girl might collect. Heirloom sewing enthusiast Martha Pullen has taken the concept of the hope chest one step further. With four married sons, Martha anxiously awaited when she would be presented with her first grandchild. When her grandson Campbell came along in the spring of 1992, and she learned her second grandchild would arrive four months later, she thought to herself &#39;Why didn&#39;t I start making baby clothes years ago.&#34; With this came her idea for &#39;Grandmother&#39;s Hope Chest&#39;. This book is to encourage mothers, grandmothers, godmothers, aunts, and even friends who invision babies in their futures to start work on layettes today. Many of the patterns and instructions included in this book call for French sewing, so Martha Pullen shares her vast knowledge in this art. Martha has pulled from her personal collection of antique baby clothing to give this book the ultimate heirloom flavor. The specifics of each dress, boy suit, and gown are described extensively for those of you who wish to reproduce them. Much of the antique detail has been adapted to the new christening gown designs to capture the turn-of-the-century look. The center of the book is graced with 48 pages of beautiful color photography. Each of the sixteen christening gown designs is captured in full detail, as well as several antique ones. Six smocking plates are shown in full-color. Martha calls these clothes &#39;love clothes&#39;. That&#39;s really what these garments are, love clothes made for very special people.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>America Street: A Multicultural Anthology of Stories</h2><p><p><strong>"It is a treat to have [these stories] pulled together here, reflecting as they do the dignity of individuals and the strength of family bonds across different cultures."&#x2015;<em>School Library Journa</em>l</strong></p> Welcome to America Street, where every story is as vital and unique as the friends, neighbors, and relatives we encounter every day. Here are fourteen stories about young people told by some of America's best storytellers: Duane Big Eagle, Toni Cade Bambara, Robert Cormier, Langston Hughes, Gish Jen, Francisco Jimï¿½nez, Mary K. Mazotti, Nicholasa Mohr, Toshio Mori, Leslie Namioka, Naomi Shihab Nye, Grace Paley, Gary Soto, and Michele Wallace.</p><p><strong>Anne Mazer</strong> is the author of several widely acclaimed books, including the novels <em>Moose Street</em> and <em>The Oxboy</em>, and a picture book, <em>The Salamander Room</em>, winner of the Keystone to Reading Book Award and a <em>Reading Rainbow</em> Feature Selection. Anthologies from edited by Mazer include: <em>America Street, Going Where I'm Coming From, A Walk in My World</em>, and <em>Working Days</em>. Mazer grew up in Syracuse, NY and lives in Ithaca, NY.Mazer ( Moose Street ) presents a smorgasbord of multiethnic experiences with 14 slice-of-life stories featuring teens (mostly contemporary) whose parents or grandparents immigrated to the U.S. The sociocultural backgrounds of characters are diverse, yet all share the common goal of finding a place for themselves. Some (Toni Cade Bambara's Hazel Parker, a prize-winning runner in "Raymond's Run," and Gary Soto's day-dreaming Fausto, of "The No-Guitar Blues") strive to rise above the crowd and to be recognized for their abilities. Other protagonists are concerned primarily with blending in and remaining as inconspicuous as possible. For example, the narrator of Lensey Namioka's "The All-American Slurp" is mortified by her family's dining-room etiquette. In a similar vein, the heroine of Gish Jen's "The White Umbrella" wishes she were part of a more "American" family--until her loyalty for her mother is tested.

This may seem to be an accurate description of every commercial aired on TV, but such commercials are actually symptomatic of a much more important cultural shift. Arthur Hunt argues that there is a conceptual transformation taking place today, as we move from an emphasis on the "word" to the predominance of the "image."</p> <p>Hunt focuses on the contrast between a Judeo-Christian heritage, characteristically word-dependent-and paganism, typically image-dependent. As people trust experience and visual representations to interpret their surroundings, they focus less on content and more on sensory appeal. Hunt argues that movements like the Protestant Reformation, Puritanism, and the beginnings of the American nation were all created and sustained in an environment that transmitted its ideas through words, while historical shifts to emphasize image have occurred during periods like the Dark Ages. As the word, both written and spoken, is devalued, there is a renewed descent into paganism.</p> <p>A wide range of issues-education, politics, entertainment, postmodernism-are brought together in an incisive, illuminating way. This book examines trends in today's culture and churches that lead away from a word-centered world and into an image-soaked world ripe for propaganda and a demagogue.</p></p><p>Arthur W.

He offers extensive contemporary application, in terms of postmodern sensibilities, to Ellul's assertion in <i>Propaganda</i> that 'people manipulated by propaganda become increasingly impervious to spiritual realities.' He puts a sharp point on this in his penultimate chapter, 'Formula for a Fï¿½hrer,' revealing his media ecology credentials, by demonstrating that communication media are never neutral. --Gregory Edward Reynolds, pastor of Amoskeag Presbyterian Church in Manchester, NH, author of The Word Is Worth a Thousand Pictures: Preaching in the Electronic Age, and editor of Ordained Servant: A Journal for Church Officers<br><br>This sane, sobering, and penetrating book explains how technologies of communication shape the minds and lives of us all.

He encounters a veritable symphony of new sounds on his pilgrimage--the insistent beat of soldiers' drums, the harmonic chanting of monks, the general cacophony of a big city--but sadly, this barrage of new sounds bewilders and overwhelms Simeon, who feels his own attempts at song suffer in comparison. Lonely and weary, he abandons his quest and trades his lute for a canoe to take him home. On the way, Simeon befriends a bright little bird, a beautiful fish, and lovely fawn who become his companions. Heartened by his new friends and overjoyed to see his beloved Sorrel, Simeon breaks into song and discovers the music of his soul.<p> Julie Andrews Edwards, author of <i>The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles</i> and star of <i>Mary Poppins</i> and <i>The Sound of Music</i>, has teamed up again with her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton (<i>Dumpy the Dumptruck</i>, etc.), for an original story with all the elements of traditional fairy tales.

Lewis, George MacDonald, and the legacy of the Inklings, has made it his life&#39;s passion to promote the teachings of these giants of the past. Following the tradition of C.S. Lewis, he stands with others through the years who have shared a vision to awaken interest in the man known as the Father of the Inklings, including the names Kilby, Yates, Hein, Sadler, Reis, Robb, Amell, Triggs, Raeper, and many contributors to this important work. Through their efforts, MacDonald&#39;s legacy lives on in the lives of thousands of spiritual grandsons and granddaughters. Michael Phillips is widely known as George MacDonald&#39;s redactor, publisher, and biographer, whose vision and editorial expertise building upon the forerunning work of C.S. Lewis, Elizabeth Yates, and Rolland Hein helped bring MacDonald back from obscurity in the 1980s when his realistic novels had been nearly forgotten. Author and editor of over 100 books, Phillips efforts helped ignite the MacDonald renaissance of recent years. As one of those responsible for the widespread renewal of MacDonald&#39;s influence, Phillips is recognized as among the world&#39;s foremost purveyors of MacDonald s message, with particular insight into the Scotsman&#39;s heart and spiritual vision. Michael Phillips is considered to be one of the most versatile and prolific Christian authors of our time. To those unfamiliar with his work, the question, What kind of books does Michael Phillips write? has no easy answer. He began his distinguished writing career in 1977 with several non-fiction titles. Since that time, he has authored over twenty non-fiction books, most notably dealing with the nature and character of God and the Fatherhood of God. After turning to the writing of novels in the mid 1980s, Phillips has penned some sixty fiction titles of great variety. The enormous breadth of his faithful audience is testimony that his writings are universal in their appeal. Most of his series have been best sellers in the Christian market. In the 1970s Michael Phillips discovered the writings of Victorian Scotsman George MacDonald, whose books were foundational in leading C.S. Lewis out of atheism into Christianity. Phillips soon made it his life s work and passion to bring to public attention the literary and spiritual links between MacDonald and Lewis. If MacDonald is the father of the Inklings, Phillips calls himself one of thousands of sons of the Inklings. Inspired by the groundbreaking work of two other pioneers with similar vision to his own, authoress Elizabeth Yates and Wheaton s Dr. Rolland Hein, Phillips recognized that MacDonald s realistic fiction novels were in precarious danger of being lost to history. He knew that new publication avenues were needed. To accomplish the goal of bringing MacDonald s name back into prominence, he set about preparing and releasing updated and edited editions of MacDonald&#39;s novels, as well as republishing MacDonald s novels, sermons, and poems in their original editions. His multi-dimensional efforts resulted in a new generation of readers having access to MacDonald&#39;s books again for themselves. Phillips is also known as George MacDonald&#39;s biographer. His George MacDonald, Scotland&#39;s Beloved Storyteller, was the first major biography of MacDonald produced in the U.S. and remains one of the best selling MacDonald biographies of all time. As his own volume of work reaches a stature of significance in its own right, Phillips is regarded, like Lewis and Hein before him, as one of many successors to MacDonald&#39;s vision and spiritual legacy for a new generation.&#34;I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him (MacDonald) as my master.&#34; --C. S. Lewis</p><h2>Conan: The Hour Of The Dragon</h2><p>First book publication of this Conan tale, first serialized in Weird Tales in 1936/36.</p><p>Of the 21 Conan the Barbarian tales that Robert E. Howard (1906-1936) completed in his all-too-brief lifetime, <i>Hour of the Dragon</i> was the only novel-length story. It may also be the very best of the series, crafted when the legendary pulp writer was working at the height of his powers. Conan is a huge swordsman fighting both natural and supernatural foes in a time-lost world known as the Hyborian Age. At this point in his bloody career, Conan is the middle-aged king of the ancient kingdom of Aquilonia. He must fight one final battle to save the known world from a resurrected sorcerer named Xaltotun. Only the fabled Heart of Ahriman can destroy Xaltotun, and Conan must embark on an epic quest to retrieve the Heart. Howard hammered out every word as if he had actually lived through it himself, and in doing so forged a crimson masterpiece of heroic fantasy. (This novel has also been published as part of the formal Conan series as <i>Conan the Conqueror</i>.) <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>Robert E. Howard (1906-1936) was born and raised in rural Texas, the son of a pioneer physician. He began writing professionally at the age of fifteen and turned out dozens of tales of heroic and supernatural fantasy, featuring many memorable creations - including the character he is best remembered for: Conan of Cimmeria. These stories, mostly published in Weird Tales, won him a huge audience across the world and influenced a whole generation of writers, from Robert Jordan to Raymond E. Feist. Sadly, Howard killed himself in June 1936 when he learned that his beloved mother had fallen into a coma.</p><h2>Feersum Endjinn</h2><p>Count Sessine is about to die for the very last time ...Chief Scientist Gadfium is about to receive the mysterious message she has been waiting for from the Plain of Sliding Stones ...And Bascule the Teller, in search of an ant, is about to enter the chaos of the crypt ...And everything is about to change ...For this is the time of the encroachment and, although the dimming sun still shines on the vast, towering walls of Serehfa Fastness, the end is close at hand.

The crypt knows it too; so an emissary has been sent, an emissary who holds the key to all their futures.</p><p>In a future where the ancients have long since departed Earth for the stars, those left behind live complacent lives filled with technological marvels they no longer understand. Then a cosmic threat known as the Encroachment begins a devastating ice age on Earth, and it sets in motion a series of events that will bring together a cast of original characters who must struggle through war, political intrigues and age-old mysteries to save the world.

For a catastrophe is fast approaching the earth from which there is no escape - until a loophole through apocalypse is discovered. And a chosen few will do anything to keep it a secret. Someone has betrayed Sessine, killed him before he could uncover the truth. Now he has three days before his funeral to live the way men used to live: restricted to one life where one mistake could be his last. Suddenly he finds himself an outlaw, a fugitive, a desperado.

Critics have said of the original French edition: "magisterial," "well-researched, serious, and honest," "reveals unsuspected facets. A very complete work," "a rich, important contribution to contemporary religious history," "a literary event," "a landmark." Influential French traditional Catholic publisher Jean Madiran said, "...the fruit of several years of considerable labor. The book is rich in documentation, often unpublished, and in many theological observations." <p>Marcel Lefebvre&#x2019;s (1905-91) career saw him make a meteoric rise through the ranks. At age 42, this missionary priest was appointed bishop in Senegal by Pope Pius XII. One year later, he was named as the Holy See&#x2019;s Apostolic Delegate for French-speaking Africa. In 1962 he was elected Superior General of the 5,000-member Holy Ghost Fathers. Pope John XXIII made him an Assistant to the Papal Throne and a member of the Preparatory Commission for the Second Vatican Council. </p><p>In 1968 he felt obliged to resign from his post as Superior General, and on November 1, 1970, he founded the Society of St. Pius X in Ecï¿½ne (Switzerland) with canonical approval. He gradually became well-known throughout the world because of his adherence to the "Latin Mass," his opposition to some of the innovations of Vatican II (1962-65), and his disagreements with Pope Paul VI. </p><p>After the Vatican sanctioned him and the Society, he celebrated a "forbidden Mass" in Lille, France (1976), before 10,000 Catholics and 400 journalists, an event that brought him and his convictions international status. In 1988 he made headlines again when he consecrated four bishops without the permission of Pope John Paul II. </p><p>All Catholics, particularly those attached to the Tridentine Mass, owe a huge debt of gratitude to this man who was so extraordinarily sure of himself only because he was absolutely sure of God. We ought to know him better.</p></p><p></p><h2>Theatre of the Oppressed (Pluto Classics)</h2><p>As illiteracy has been shown to be a weapon of the ruling class, so Augusto Boal shows theatre to be a weapon, not only of bourgeois control but of revolution. He demonstrates the ways in which theatre has come to reflect ruling-class control, drawing on the theories of Aristotle and Machiavelli. He then shows the process reversed in Brechtian/Marxist poetics. All the theory is related to his own experience of revolutionary theatre in Latin America, and illustrated with practical examples of exercises and games used in the People&#39;s Theatre of Peru. This is now a classic text on radical drama. Boal restores theatre to its proper place as a popular form of communication and expression, and points to the revolutionary potential of transforming the spectator into the actor.</p><p>Is the fundamental relationship between an actor and an audience an equal and active one, or is it a situation that encourages passivity and division? This is the question at the heart of Augusto Boal's revolutionary <i>Theatre of the Oppressed</i>, originally published in 1979. Boal, a Brazilian artist and activist, has written a work that challenges the very premise of Western theater, starting with Aristotle and the first dramatists, and explores what social constructs lie behind the traditional theater form. Then, having explained such often invoked (but rarely scrutinized) terms as <i>imitation</i>, <i>tragedy</i>, and <i>justice</i>, he puts forward a new type of drama that bridges the long-existing gap between theater and politics. Central to his thesis is an attempt to bring spectators into an active role with the drama, encouraging them to comment on the social situations they see presented and suggest potentials for change. Other chapters explore the writings of Hegel and Brecht, along with a lengthy analysis of one of the most profound political thinkers to ever pen a play, Machiavelli and his bitter comedy <i>Mandragola</i>. Boal's book is a challenging one for American actors often politically naive and heavily schooled in the traditions of Stanislavsky-based "naturalism," but this text is vital reading for activists, progressives, and all artists trying to effect social change. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i><p><b>Augusto Boal</b> (1931 - 2009) was a renowned dramatist and the author of several works on politics and theatre.</p></p><h2>How to Build Model Railroad Benchwork, Second Edition (Model Railroader)</h2><p>Demonstrates how to plan and build the basic framework to support layouts of any size, shape or gauge.</p><p>Westcott's new edition of the most important book on the elaborate carpentry that supports model railroad layouts.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dangerous Calling: Confronting the Unique Challenges of Pastoral Ministry</h2><p>Paul David Tripp is concerned about the state of pastoral culture.

This book digs down into the inner recesses of our hearts to reveal our greatest idols and point to our greatest needs. It will make you joyfully uncomfortable and, by God&#x2019;s grace, will bring you to your knees in tears of thankfulness only to help lift your weary head to fix your renewed gaze on Christ. This book is like a mirror that redirects our hearts&#x2019; reflection from ourselves to Christ. If this book were a sermon, it would be the most weighty and refreshing sermon you&#x2019;ve ever needed to hear.

We will see the need to save our selves from a very dark and destructive force working against pastors: undiagnosed pastoral self-righteousness.

So why aren&#x2019;t more people listening? <br><br>History has proven that guns are essential to self-defense and liberty&#x2014;but tragedy is a powerful force and has led many to believe that guns are the enemy, that the Second Amendment is outdated, and that more restrictions or outright bans on firearms will somehow solve everything. <br><br>They are wrong. <br><br>In <i>Control, </i>Glenn Beck takes on and debunks the common myths and outright lies that are often used to vilify guns and demean their owners: <br><br>The Second Amendment is ABOUT MUSKETS...GUN CONTROL WORKS in other countries...40 percent of all guns are sold without BACKGROUND CHECKS...More GUNS MEAN more MURDER...Mass shootings are becoming more common...These awful MASSACRES ARE UNIQUE TO AMERICA...No CIVILIAN needs a &#x201c;weapon of war&#x201d; like the AR-15...ARMED GUARDS in schools do nothing, just look at Columbine...Stop FEARMONGERING, no one is talking about TAKING YOUR GUNS AWAY. <br>Backed by hundreds of sources, this handbook gives everyone who cares about the Second Amendment the indisputable facts they need to reclaim the debate, defeat the fear, and take back their natural rights.</p><p>Glenn Beck, the nationally syndicated radio host and founder of TheBlaze television network, has written thirteen #1 bestselling books and is one of the few authors in history to have had #1 national bestsellers in the fiction, nonfiction, self-help, and children&#x2019;s picture book genres.

The president, who had barely used the word gun over his first four years in office, was about to rearrange his second-term agenda. Gun control would now be right near the top of the priority list.<br> <br>Sensing a once-in-a-generation opportunity, controllist politicians and groups began to pounce. News programs devoted full hours to the issue. Opinion hosts like Piers Morgan, sensing an issue to make their mark with, began virtual crusades, discussing the topic nightly. Hollywood celebrities, brought together by the progressive group Mayors Against Illegal Guns, &#x201c;demanded a plan&#x201d; to end gun violence via YouTube videos and television commercials. This, of course, despite that fact that many of those who appeared in the videos had made their careers&#x2014;and their millions&#x2014;depicting intense gun violence in movies.<br> <br>It was during this time that I realized the need for this part of the book, something that would answer all the lies about guns that are repeated again and again and often go uncontested. But instead of making up arguments&#x2014;which would inevitably result in critics saying that no one really makes those claims, or that I misrepresented them&#x2014;I wanted to use actual quotes. So we started a little project. Each night my staff and I watched countless hours of cable news and read hundreds of newspaper columns and articles. We listened for the quotes about guns and the Second Amendment that seemed to come up most often, the stuff that is so pervasive that it&#x2019;s barely even questioned anymore.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t difficult. Before long we had enough for not only one book, but several of them. We whittled the quotes down to those that seemed to be repeated the most often&#x2014;and then we sat down with a team of economists, criminologists, and other gun experts and answered each of them with the truth.<br> IT&#x2019;S TIME FOR AMERICA TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS.<p></p> <br>&#x201c;Leaders in Washington from both parties and groups like the NRA all say that now is not the time to talk about how gun safety laws can save lives in America. I agree, now is not the time to talk about gun laws. The time for that conversation was long before all those kids in Connecticut died today.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;REPRESENTATIVE CAROLYN MCCARTHY (D-NY), December 14, 2012<br> <br>&#x201c;If there&#x2019;s one thing about the gun debate that everyone seems to agree on, it&#x2019;s that we&#x2019;re going to have a national conversation on the subject. Great news!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;CINDY HANDLER (Huffington Post columnist), January 11, 2013<br> <br>Actually, we&#x2019;ve had a national conversation about guns for the last two centuries; you just don&#x2019;t like the way it turned out. You may not have noticed, but the so-called gun debate was settled quite a while ago.<br> <br>In 1791.<br> WE SHOULD START DRAFTING A BILL TO ENSURE NEWTOWN NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.<p></p> <br>&#x201c;[My bill] will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation, and the possession, not retroactively but prospectively. And it will ban the same for big clips, drums, or strips of more than ten bullets. So there will be a bill. We&#x2019;ve been working on it now for a year . . . . It&#x2019;ll be ready on the first day.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA), December 16, 2012<br> <br>Hang on, you&#x2019;ve been &#x201c;working&#x201d; on this bill for a year? Was it just sitting in a desk drawer waiting for a terrible massacre that you could leverage for political expedience?<br> <br>Wait&#x2014;don&#x2019;t answer that.<br> GUNS ARE LETHAL.<p></p> <br>&#x201c;[T]he point about guns is that they are so much more lethal than anything else you have around. I mean, that is why the American military arms its troops not with knives, but with automatic weapons.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;NICHOLAS KRISTOF (New York Times columnist), January 8, 2013<br> <br>&#x201c;When [a .223-caliber round] hits a human body, the effects are devastating.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, January 8, 2013<br> <br>I know this might be breaking news to Nicholas Kristof, but guns being &#x201c;more lethal than anything else you have around&#x201d; is sort of the whole point. The issue should not really be the lethality of the gun, but the psychology of the person holding it. If we are teaching people how to respect their weapons and use them safely, then the times when they&#x2019;re &#x201c;lethal&#x201d; are the times when we want them to be.<br> <br>Outside of hunting and sport shooting, guns serve as &#x201c;equalizers.&#x201d; With a gun, even an elderly grandmother might well be able to fend off an attacker. Violent criminals are, after all, overwhelmingly young, strong males. To them, anything&#x2014;from a knife to their bare hand&#x2014;could easily serve as lethal weapons.<br> <br>And it is not just Grandma. The equalizer argument applies to most women, to older men, and especially to the disabled&#x2014;a group that is a particular target for robberies. Guns provide the only effective way for them to defend themselves.<br> <br>The evidence&#x2014;and there is plenty of it&#x2014;points to the exact opposite of what Kristof claims: cutting access to guns mainly disarms law-abiding citizens, making criminals&#x2019; lives that much easier. Guns allow potential victims to defend themselves when the police aren&#x2019;t there.<br> <br>Besides, guns may be the most lethal weapon around that&#x2019;s easily accessible, but if we&#x2019;re just talking about overall ability to kill a lot of people, it&#x2019;s hard not to include explosives, which are used by the military and mass killers alike. The first attack on the World Trade Center, in 1993, was a bombing. The Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 killed 168 people and was caused by bombs created from such easily available items as fertilizer (ammonium nitrate), a common cleaning solvent (liquid nitromethane), and diesel fuel. And the worst school massacre in U.S. history, in which thirty-eight people were killed, occurred in 1927 and was carried out with a bomb.<br> NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY.<p></p> <br>&#x201c;No one is saying that people&#x2019;s guns should be taken away, or that taking the Second Amendment rights away. No one is saying that [is the answer] . . . &#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;DON LEMON (CNN anchor), July 22, 2012<br> <br>&#x201c;Nobody questions the Second Amendment&#x2019;s right to bear arms.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (New York City), December 16, 2012<br> <br>&#x201c;Guys, gals, now hear this: No one wants to take away your hunting rifles. No one wants to take away your shotguns. No one wants to take away your revolvers, and no one wants to take away your automatic pistols, as long as said pistols hold no more than ten rounds.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;STEPHEN KING, Guns<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to change the Second Amendment. I don&#x2019;t want to change an American&#x2019;s right to bear an arm in their home to defend people. I want to get rid of these killing machine assault weapons off the street.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;PIERS MORGAN, January 7, 2013<br> <br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Gun grabber&#x2019; is a mythical boogeyman. No serious person, including Obama, is even proposing taking away owned guns. #StopFearmongering.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;TOURï¿½, February 16, 2013 (via Twitter)<br> <br>Anyone who&#x2019;s closely watching the bullying from the controllist crowd, and knows their history, has good reason to be concerned. The environment that&#x2019;s been created is eerily similar to what nations like the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada experienced just before introducing severe private gun ownership restrictions or banning them altogether.<br> <br>Here in the United States, the Second Amendment has seemingly gone from being a God-given natural right to a privilege that must be defended. Yet the moment anyone dares voice those concerns they are usually met with mockery and dismissed as a bloodthirsty, paranoid freak who is bitterly clinging to their guns even as the mainstream of society passes them by.<br> <br>Gun rights advocates are thought by the elite controllists to be creatures with the intelligence of a Neanderthal, stubbornly unwilling to accept &#x201c;commonsense&#x201d; gun control measures that would allegedly save the lives of countless American children. The mere mention of a &#x201c;slippery slope,&#x201d; with the Second Amendment itself being the real target, is brushed off as laughably preposterous conspiracy theory.<br> <br>The truth&#x2014;which, as you&#x2019;ll soon see, is not a conspiracy or a theory&#x2014;is that there are many controllists who want nothing more than to ban guns. They admire Australia and the United Kingdom and Japan and believe that the &#x201c;civilized&#x201d; nations of the world have evolved and left America behind. Those countries are the grown-ups while we Americans are the toddlers throwing temper tantrums in a corner.<br> <br>But controllists have a major problem: the Bill of Rights. Americans have a constitutional right to bear arms&#x2014;and lots of people want to keep it that way.<br> <br>According to a December 2012 Gallup poll, 74 percent of Americans oppose a ban on the possession of handguns. So that leaves controllists in a bind: They believe that guns have no place among civilians, but they can&#x2019;t really say that. So they carefully parse their language. Instead of talking about handgun bans they focus on &#x201c;military-style&#x201d; assault weapons or &#x201c;high-capacity&#x201d; magazines or laws that make it more difficult to purchase a weapon or ammunition.<br> <br>But what do you think happens once they get these initial laws passed&#x2014;do they just stop? Do they pat themselves on the back for getting clips limited to ten bullets, or do they start a new push for eight or five? Do they celebrate getting the sale of new semi-automatics banned, or do they now start to go after all of the ones currently in circulation? That question can easily be answered for anyone willing to listen to what the controllists actually say.<br> <br>Last we left Senator Dianne Feinstein&#x2014;the author of the 1994 and 2013 federal assault weapon bans&#x2014;she was explaining to 60 Minutes in 1995 that she would&#x2019;ve liked to have gotten rid of all so-called assault weapons (not just the specific guns included in the ban), but she just couldn&#x2019;t get it through that pesky Congress:<br> <br>If I could&#x2019;ve gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them&#x2014;Mr. and Mrs. America turn &#x2019;em all in&#x2014;I would have done it.<br> <br>President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have also given strong assurances about their commitment to the Second Amendment, but then they put Attorney General Eric Holder in charge of crafting Obama&#x2019;s executive orders on gun control in the wake of the Newtown massacre. Why is that an issue? Because you&#x2019;d be hard-pressed to find someone more anti-gun (except, of course, when it comes to handing them to Mexican drug cartel members) than Holder.<br> <br>In a 1995 talk before the Woman&#x2019;s National Democratic Club, Holder said that he hoped we could one day make gun owners feel as ostracized as the smokers who &#x201c;cower&#x201d; outside of buildings:<br> <br>What we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people, and make it something that&#x2019;s not cool, that it&#x2019;s not acceptable, it&#x2019;s not hip to carry a gun anymore, in the way in which we&#x2019;ve changed our attitudes about cigarettes. You know, when I was growing up, people smoked all the time. Both my parents did. But over time, we changed the way that people thought about smoking, so now we have people who cower outside of buildings and kind of smoke in private and don&#x2019;t want to admit it.<br> <br>And later, in the same speech: &#x201c;We have to be repetitive about this. We need to do this every day of the week, and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.&#x201d; (emphasis added)<br> <br>Eric Holder may have been smart enough to not use the word ban, but others haven&#x2019;t been so careful.<br> <br>Remember the quote at the beginning of this section where CNN anchor Don Lemon claimed that &#x201c;no one is saying&#x201d; we should take people&#x2019;s guns away? Well, just five months later, he was contradicted by someone he knows very well: Don Lemon.<br> <br>&#x201c;We need to get guns and bullets and automatic weapons off the streets,&#x201d; Lemon said. &#x201c;They should only be available to police officers and to hunt al Qaeda and the Taliban and not hunt elementary school children.&#x201d;<br> <br>So we should get rid of guns and bullets but no one is saying we should take people&#x2019;s guns away? Same guy. Same year. Incredible.<br> <br>In case Don Lemon isn&#x2019;t impressed by his own inconsistency, here are a few more concrete examples of people openly calling for gun bans:<br> <br>How can we possibly have assault weapons? And frankly, why do we need guns? We don&#x2019;t need guns. We have 10,000 murders a year.<br> <br>&#x2014;BUZZ BISSINGER, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author and Daily Beast columnist<br> <br>But the logic is faulty, and a close look at it leads to the conclusion that the United States should ban private gun ownership entirely, or almost entirely.<br> <br>&#x2014;JEFF MCMAHAN, professor of philosophy at Rutgers University, writing in the New York Times<br> <br>And this banning mind-set isn&#x2019;t just a reaction to Newtown; it&#x2019;s been around for a while. The editors of the Los Angeles Times, in an editorial from 1993 titled &#x201c;Taming the Monster: Get Rid of the Guns,&#x201d; wrote:<br> <br>No guns, period, except for those held by law enforcement officials and a few others . . . . Why should America adopt a policy of near-zero tolerance for private gun ownership? Because it&#x2019;s the only alternative to the present insanity. Without both strict limits on access to new weapons and aggressive efforts to reduce the supply of existing weapons, no one can be safer.<br> <br>Six years later the Washington Post got into the act. &#x201c;No presidential candidate,&#x201d; the paper editorialized, &#x201c;has yet come out for the most effective proposal to check the terror of gunfire: a ban on the general sale, manufacture and ownership of handguns as well as assault-style weapons.&#x201d;<br> <br>In other words, the &#x201c;most effective&#x201d; plan, according to these editors, is a ban of all handguns and assault weapons. A more recent editorial in the Economist seems to agree:<br> <br>I personally dislike guns. I think the private ownership of guns is a tragic mistake. But a majority of Americans disagree with me, some of them very strongly. And at a certain point, when very large majorities disagree with you, a bit of deference is in order.<br> <br>. . . I am pretty sure that the sort of gun control that would work&#x2014;banning all guns&#x2014;is not going to happen.<br> <br>Is it possible these opinions don&#x2019;t count because, like corporations, progressives don&#x2019;t consider editorial boards to be &#x201c;people&#x201d;?<br> <br>Back in the present day, Piers Morgan, who claims with a straight face, &#x201c;I totally respect and admire the Constitution and the Second Amendment and an American&#x2019;s right to defend themselves at home,&#x201d; has also gotten in on the act. This is from his January 10, 2013, show:<br> <br>PIERS MORGAN: You&#x2019;ve got to make a stand somewhere. You have to start somewhere. The logical place to start, given that automatic weapons are banned, is you go to the next level down, semiautomatic weapons.

Ellie!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the hill, grinning like a bear with a paw in the honey hive and his face red from running. His stubby tumanhofer body bounced with excitement. He held his fists above his head and whirled them around in circles. Something had set him off.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood and hollered back. &#x201c;You be calling me by my proper name out in the open &#x2019;n&#x2019; at the top of your lungs, Gustustharinback.

Probably a delivery of the bolt of muslin ordered, which meant she&#x2019;d be cutting and dyeing lengths for making new clothes. Not exciting news at all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Can it wait?&#x201d; She gestured behind her to the scattered goat herd. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to gather Tak&#x2019;s clan if I&#x2019;m to come home now.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come help you.&#x201d; Gustus charged down the hill toward the footbridge across the river.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellie stared at him for a moment with her mouth hanging open. The good news had nothing to do with cloth. Her brother would never voluntarily help bring in the goats for something as mundane as new clothes. He scurried down the path, slipping some on the loose rocks. But the precarious descent did not slow him a bit. Even in the narrower patches, where exposed roots of arranndon bushes tripped careless hikers, her sturdy brother skidded downward.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folding the royal celebration notice into a small square, Ellie stuffed it back in her pocket. She turned away from watching her brother&#x2019;s progress and nudged the goat. &#x201c;Come on, Tak. You find the nannies, and I&#x2019;ll find the billies.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellie went one direction and Tak another. In a few minutes, she located the fifteen goats that formed the herd. Mostly young males, these animals preferred the rockier terrain. She suspected it had to do with their perpetual game of I&#x2019;m-up-highest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clicked her tongue and tapped her staff on a rock. Their heads rose as if all attached to the same string, though they didn&#x2019;t come right away. Each one chewed what was in his mouth and casually left his place one by one. Taking a serene amble down the hillside, they passed her, heading toward the bridge and home.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last one clomped by, Ellie rested her staff on her shoulder and followed. Tak already had the nannies plodding along the bank toward the footbridge. Gustustharinback trailed the nannies and carried the smallest of the baby goats in his arms.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted when he caught sight of his sister. &#x201c;Hurry! Aunt and Uncle Blamenyellomont are at the house. I can&#x2019;t tell you the surprise, and I&#x2019;m gonna burst with keeping my tongue from waggin&#x2019; and you from knowin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tapped her staff on the rock beneath her feet. The billies scampered before her, picking up her impatience and gratefully heading for home. Even after eating all day, they appreciated the handfuls of button grain they got from the farmer&#x2019;s younger children.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the goat hoofs pounding on the wooden bridge, Ellie couldn&#x2019;t hear or be heard. So she waited until she&#x2019;d caught up with her brother on the other side.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s with all the falderal, Gustus?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She watched as he forced a glare onto his face, erasing the impudent grin he&#x2019;d been wearing. &#x201c;You are to call me by my proper name if I have to call you by yours.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a difference between shouting &#x2018;Ellie&#x2019; and speaking &#x2018;Gustus&#x2019; quietly.&#x201d; She grabbed his arm. &#x201c;Now tell me, or I&#x2019;ll toss you into the river.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed his lips together and gave her his most obstinate glower. The corners of his lips twitched, and she knew he wanted to laugh. She let go. She couldn&#x2019;t really dunk him while he carried the small kid.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Why are our aunt and uncle here?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t tell you that either. But they&#x2019;s only stopping, not staying. We&#x2019;d better hurry.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellie lost Gustustharinback&#x2019;s help as soon as they came in sight of the pens. He scuttled down the last hill and opened the gate but then ran through the goat barn, across the yard, and into the house.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The herd followed the leader through the opening and took up different places to observe their world. Ellie and Gustus had put many odd things within the goat pen for the animals to climb on. Old wooden benches, barrels, a huge thick branch they had pulled with the donkey&#x2019;s help, and crates littered the ground. The goats enjoyed scrambling up, over, and around the obstacles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tak stayed at Ellie&#x2019;s side as she put water in the trough and fastened the barn door securely open so the animals could come in if they wanted. He followed her out the door on the other side of the barn and waited patiently while she latched it shut.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the back door so she could wash before meeting their visitors, Ellie noticed that the kitchen showed signs of serving tea. Her mother must have prepared refreshments to carry into the common room. Through the pantry door, she could see empty spots on the shelves, which meant the good china pot and the blue glass dishes were being used.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm water sat in a tub in the sink, and she used that to wash her face and hands. She pulled the scarf off her head, gathered her long, curly black locks into a ponytail and used the scarf to tie it in place. Wisps of hair immediately escaped and framed her tanned face. She washed her face again as if she could rid herself of the look of a farm girl. Hopefully Aunt Tiffenbeth wouldn&#x2019;t make that tired old comment: &#x201c;Your blue eyes would be more attractive if you scrubbed away some of that mud you use for face cream.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices from the family&#x2019;s conversation drifted through the partially open door. Aunt Tiffenbeth quarreled with Ellie&#x2019;s father.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Brother, you are wrong in this. Ellicinderpart is your eldest child and way past the age to be in the village looking for a husband.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;If there&#x2019;s a man good enough for her, he can just come courting here.&#x201d; Her father&#x2019;s voice rumbled in the wood-paneled room, and Ellie did not even have to strain to hear him. She stepped closer to the door in order not to miss a single word her aunt spoke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You are the most vexing man. That is <i>not </i>going to happen. It isn&#x2019;t the way of things, and you know it. You&#x2019;re selfish and your mind is rootbound.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only his older sister could get away with talking like that to Ellie&#x2019;s father. She probably ought to go in before the discussion escalated to verbal warfare. She finished wiping her hands and draped the towel over one of the kitchen chairs around the square table.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The girl is needed here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The young woman is your unpaid servant.&#x201d;</p><h2>Dracula&#39;s Guest and Other Weird Tales (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>Menacing tales from one of the masters of horror fiction</b><p>Although Bram Stoker is best known for his world-famous novel <i>Dracula</i>, he also wrote many shorter works on the strange and the macabre.

He went on to act as as manager and secretary for the actor Sir Henry Irving. He wrote seventeen books, the most famous of which is <i>Dracula</i>.Extract from <b>Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Tales</b> by <b>Bram Stoker</b><p>Introduction</p><p>To many, Bram Stoker&#x2019;s name has become synonymous with a single piece of work that, since its publication in 1897, has grown to typify the Victorian Gothic genre. Dracula, with its smorgasbord of sexual fantasies and social anxieties, has so far eclipsed anything else that he has written that, to the reader unaccustomed to Stoker&#x2019;s oeuvre outside it, the extent and range of work that he produced will be somewhat surprising. Thirteen novels, two biographies, one play, one civil service manual and numerous lectures and short stories have all been overshadowed by a single vampire narrative. For a man who wrote so much, that so much should in turn be written about such a small section of his work is a paradox; Dracula remains at the forefront and the focus of both academic and popular interest.</p><p>This concept of paradox is actually wholly appropriate to Stoker&#x2019;s work. Despite Dracula&#x2019;s longstanding popularity, its literary merits are less assured, Maud Ellmann arguing that &#x2018;the novel wouldn&#x2019;t be so good if it weren&#x2019;t so very bad&#x2019;, whilst of his other works, &#x2018;most of them [were] execrable&#x2019;. In turn, in his introduction to the 1983 Oxford World Classics edition of Dracula, A. N. Wilson scoffed that, &#x2018;No one in their right mind would think of Stoker as &#x201c;a great writer&#x201d;. Popular yet pulp, enduring yet unendurable &#x2014; the sense of discrepancy inherent in Stoker&#x2019;s work is also applicable to the author himself; the volume of literature that has been produced about Stoker since the revival of his reputation in the early 1970s testifying, ironically, to his indecipherability. Since 1962 four full-length biographies have been written which, whilst illuminating the facts about Stoker&#x2019;s life, nevertheless fail to get to grips with the man himself. There is very little material extant in which Stoker bares his innermost thoughts. As enigmatic as his most renowned creation, Stoker himself confessed in a letter to Walt Whitman in 1872 that, &#x2018;I...;am naturally secretive to the world&#x2019;.</p><p>The bare facts about Stoker&#x2019;s life have provided rich pickings for literary detective work, and critics have tended to read his works as much for the potential biographical insight they can offer as for the stories they tell. The most manifestly persistent of these critical interpretations has been speculation about his sexual proclivities. Claims have been equally stringently made for Stoker&#x2019;s rampant heterosexual carnality, his closet homosexuality, his anal fixations, oral fixations, Oedipus complex, fear of assertive women (especially mothers) and domination fetishes. The most enduring mystery surrounding Bram Stoker&#x2019;s life in this respect has been his death. Locomotor Ataxia, a stated cause of death on Stoker&#x2019;s Death Certificate, was hailed as proof of the author&#x2019;s contraction of syphilis and thus womanizing reputation by Daniel Farson. Whilst this was rejected by Stoker&#x2019;s third biographer, Barbara Belford, and similarly dismissed by Haining and Tremayne as &#x2018;unproven&#x2019;. Stoker&#x2019;s most recent biographer, Paul Murray, has once more taken up the argument for his &#x2018;likely&#x2019; syphilitic condition, citing the author&#x2019;s stroke in 1906, his prescription for arsenic medication in 1910 and his stamping way of walking as evidence.</p><p>The virtual impenetrability of Stoker himself and the excesses contained within his fiction lend themselves to this outpouring of biographical conjecture. William Hughes and Andrew Smith argue that Dracula has become &#x2018;the Freudian text par excellence&#x2019;, revealing a wide range of repressed sexual desires and concerns. Among other interpretations, the syphilitic condition here too has been raised, the novel&#x2019;s preoccupation with insanity, pestilence and implicitly sexual contamination being cited as evidence of Stoker&#x2019;s own sexual ill-health.</p><p>To read novels solely for a glimpse of their biographical signposts, however, is to do both text and author a great disservice. Whilst fascinating in their own right as the last published works of Bram Stoker, the two hooks that comprise this volume, Dracula&#x2019;s Guest and Other Weird Stories and The Lair of the White Worm also demonstrate that ultimately Stoker was a master of the Gothic genre, fully justifying his reputation alongside late-nineteenth-century greats&#x2019; such as Robert Louis Stevenson, H. G. Wells, Sheridan Le Fanu, Oscar Wilde and Arthur Conan Doyle.</p><p>Aside from the spine-chilling excellence of such stories as &#x2018;The Burial of the Rats&#x2019;, &#x2018;The Squaw&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Judge&#x2019;s House&#x2019;, Stoker offset his tales of the weird and uncanny with an experimental outlook that not only responded to the social conscience of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but also tapped into contemporaneous experimental movements in art and literature. Far from the rather slapdash image that Stoker&#x2019;s fiction beyond Dracula has generated, such works can be seen to be the product of deep thought, research and a profound understanding of the society in which he lived. The Lair of the White Worm, for example, widely dismissed as &#x2018;clearly the work of a man sick in mind if not in body&#x2019;, is, in reality, an intensely intriguing novel, working on mythic, historical, social and sexual levels, whilst also responding to nineteenth- and early twentieth-century shifts in artistic expression. In short, Stoker was a popular fiction writer of significant aptitude, in tune with the undercurrents of the social thought and creative articulation of his time.</p></p><h2>Follow Me Down: A Novel</h2><p>A mesmerizing novel of faith, passion, and murder by the author of <i>The Civil War: A Narrative. </i>Drawing on themes as old as the Bible, Foote's novel compels us to inhabit lives obsessed with sin and starving for redemption. A work reminiscent of both Faulkner and O'Connor, yet utterly original.</p><p>Shelby Foote was born on November 7, 1916 in Greenville, Mississippi, and attended school there until he entered the University of North Carolina. During World War II he served as a captain of field artillery but never saw combat. After World War II he worked briefly for the Associated Press in their New York bureau. In 1953 he moved to Memphis, where he lived for the remainder of his life.Foote was the author of six novels: <b>Tournament</b>, <b>Follow Me Down</b>, <b>Love in a Dry Season</b>, <b>Shiloh</b>, <b>Jordan County</b>, and <b>September, September</b>. He is best remembered for his 3-volume history <b>The Civil War: A Narrative</b>, which took twenty years to complete and resulted in his being a featured expert in Ken Burns' acclaimed Civil War documentary. Over the course of his writing career, Foote was also awarded three Guggenheim fellowships.Shelby Foote died in 2005 at the age of 88.FOLLOW ME DOWN is a dark tale of sin and redemption, but greater yet, a portrayal of the complexity of human motivations. Eight characters are presented so completely that their oddly dramatic behavior--adultery, murder, defense of guilt--seems somehow rational, or at least comprehensible. Tom Parker narrates with an understated difference in the pace and pitch of the various voices; the subtlety is suitable--a more dramatic reading, especially one exaggerating the Mississippi accents, would detract from the story's weird passion. All the characters have a gentle Southern twang, with the exception of the deaf-mute, who is read with a neutral voice. This is a solid interpretation by an accomplished reader.

This is a woman, after all, trained in philosophy at the Sorbonne, Harvard, and the University of California at Berkeley, who became a painter, and then a poet. Her voice comes to us as something the opposite of her title: She is a master of light and revelation, of language, variety, and color.</p></p><p>Etel Adnan, a Lebanese-American poet, artist, and public intellectual, is the author of more than a dozen books. Her groundbreaking novel Sitt Marie Rose is one of the defining narratives of the Lebanese Civil War.The dozen lyrically descriptive stories in this eclectic collection by Lebanese-born poet and novelist Adnan range over a startling period of time and place, from 1930s Beirut through early '60s San Francisco to the first Gulf War. In the title story, the narrator meets the poet Buland in Italy, just as the bombs are falling mercilessly on Iraq. Buland recounts his abject life story, especially his harrowing guilt in having loved the generous and larger-than-life Saddam Hussein. In The Power of Death, a similarly haunted poet, Wassef, asks the narrator, based in Paris, to meet him in Stockholm, where he is literally losing his mind from grief over the death of a woman he had loved and left many years before. The first-person narrator in the wise, reflective story First Passion summons her enduring affection for a girlhood friend as a way of recapturing her richly textured life&#x2014;and fending off death. Nostalgic and meanderingly autobiographical, these powerful emotional tales seem almost magically wrought, offering a flavor of the author's own vast experience and travels. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Davies explores unanswered questions such as: <br> * Does the universe have a beginning and an end?<br> * Is the passage of time merely an illusion?<br> * Is it possible to travel backward -- or forward -- in time? <br> <i>About Time</i> weaves physics and metaphysics in a provocative contemplation of time and the universe.</p><p><b>PAUL DAVIES</b> is Director of the Beyond Center at Arizona State University and the bestselling author of more than twenty books. He won the 1995 Templeton Prize for his work on the deeper meaning of science. His books include <i>About Time</i>, <i>The Fifth Miracle</i>, and <i>The Mind of God</i>.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><br><br><b>A VERY BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME</b><br><br><i>Time is at the heart of all that is important to human beings.</i><br><br>Bernard d'Espagnat<br><br><b>WHOSE TIME IS IT ANYWAY?</b><br><br><i>Time must never be thought of as pre-existing in any sense; it is a manufactured quantity.</i><br><br>Hermann Bondi<br><br>In a dingy laboratory in Bonn lies a submarine-shaped metal cylinder. It is about three meters long, and rests comfortably in a steel frame surrounded by wires, pipes and dials. At first glance, the entire contraption looks like the inside of a giant car engine. In fact, it is a clock -- or, rather, <i>the</i> clock. The Bonn device, and a network of similar instruments across the world, together constitute "the standard clock." The individual instruments, of which the German model is currently the most accurate, are cesium-beam atomic clocks. They are continually monitored, compared, tweaked and refined via radio signals from satellites and television stations, to cajole them into near-perfect step. At the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Sï¿½vres, not far from Paris, the data are collected, analyzed and broadcast to a time-obsessed world. Thus originates the famous pips, the radio time signals by which we set our watches.<br><br>So, as we go about our daily toil, the Bonn cesium-beam clock keeps the time. It is, so to speak, a custodian of Earth time. The trouble is, the Earth itself doesn't always keep good time. Occasionally our clocks, all supposedly linked to the master system in France like a retinue of obedient slaves, must be adjusted by a second to track changes in the Earth's rotation rate. The last such "leap second" was added on 30 June 1994. The planet's spin, accurate enough to serve as a perfectly suitable clock for a thousand generations, is now defunct as a reliable chronometer. In this age of high-precision timekeeping, poor old Earth doesn't make the grade. Only an atomic clock, man-made and mysterious, serves to deliver those all-important tick-tocks with the precision demanded by navigators, astronomers and airline pilots. One second is no longer defined to be 1/86,400 of a day: it is 9,192,631,770 beats of a cesium atom.<br><br>But whose time is the Bonn clock telling anyway? Your time? My time? God's time? Are the scientists in that cluttered laboratory monitoring the pulse of the universe, fastidiously tracking some abstract cosmic time with atomic fidelity? Might there be another clock, perhaps on another planet somewhere, faithfully ticking out another time altogether, to the joy of its makers?<br><br>We know clocks need not agree: the Earth clock gets out of sync with the Bonn clock. So which one is <i>right?</i> Well, presumably the Bonn clock, because it's more accurate. But accurate relative to <i>what?</i> To <i>us?</i> After all, clocks were invented to tell the time for entirely human purposes. Are all humans "on" the same time, however? The patient in the dentist's chair and the audience listening to a Beethoven symphony experience the same atomically tagged duration in quite different ways.<br><br>So much of what we believe about time is a result of cultural conditioning. I once met a mystic in Bombay who claimed he could alter his state of consciousness through meditation and so suspend the flow of time altogether; he was unimpressed with talk of atomic clocks. In a lecture in London some years ago, I found myself sharing the platform improbably with the Dalai Lama. Our task was to compare and contrast time as it enters into Western scientific thinking and Eastern philosophy. The Lama spoke with quiet assurance, but unfortunately in Tibetan. Though I tried to follow the translation for enlightenment, I didn't receive much, regrettably. Culture clash, I suppose.<br><br>After my lecture, we had a tea break, and the Dalai Lama took my hand as we walked out of the building into the sunshine. Someone dropped to his knees and presented His Holiness with a daffodil, which he graciously accepted. I had the overwhelming impression of a gentle and intelligent man with insights of value to us all, but prevented by the trappings of his office from effectively communicating them to the assembled Western scientists. I came away from the occasion with a deep sense of missed opportunity.<br><br><b>THE QUEST FOR ETERNITY</b><br><br><i>Eternity? thou pleasing, dreadful thought?</i><br><br>Joseph Addison<br><br>In the madcap world of modern Western society, where time is money, railways, airline schedules, television programs, even cooking are subject to the tyranny of the clock. Our hectic lives are firmly bolted to the treadmill of time. We are slaves of our past and hostages to the future. But was it always thus? Running like a common thread through the history of human thought, East and West, North and South, is a belief that the entire paradigm of human temporality is rooted in some sort of monstrous illusion; it is but an elaborate product of the human mind:<br><br><i>And likewise time cannot itself exist,<br><br>But from the flight of things we get a sense of time....<br><br>No man, we must confess, feels time itself,<br><br>But only knows of time from flight or rest of things.</i><br><br>Thus wrote the Roman poet-philosopher Lucretius in his first-century epic <i>De Rerum Natura.</i> From such unsettling ideas it is but a small step to believe that the passage of time can be controlled or even suspended by mental power, as we discover in the following haunting words of the sixteenth-century mystical poet Angelus Silesius:<br><br><i>Time is of your own making,<br><br>its clock ticks in your head.<br><br>The moment you stop thought<br><br>time too stops dead.</i><br><br>For such temporal relativists, true reality is vested in a realm that transcends time: the Land Beyond Time. Europeans call it "eternity," Hindus refer to it as "moksha" and Buddhists as "nirvana." For the Australian aborigines it is the Dream Time. Angelus Silesius again:<br><br><i>Do not compute eternity<br>as light-year after year<br>One step across<br>that line called Time<br>Eternity is here.</i><br><br>In our struggle to come to terms with mental and physical reality, nothing vexes us more than the nature of time. The paradoxical conjunction of temporality and eternity has troubled Man through the ages. Plato concluded that the fleeting world of daily experience is only half real, an ephemeral reflection of a timeless domain of pure and perfect Forms, which occupy the realm of eternity. Time itself is but an imperfect "moving image of Eternity which remains forever at one," but which we human beings incorrigibly reify: "The past and future are created species of time, which we unconsciously but wrongly transfer to the eternal essence.<br><br>The abiding tension between the temporal and the eternal pervades the world's great religions, and has led to generations of heated and sometimes violent theological debate. Is God inside or outside of time? Temporal or eternal? Process or Being? According to Plotinus, a third-century pagan, to exist in time is to exist imperfectly. Pure Being (i.e., God) must therefore be characterized by the utter absence of any relation to time. For Plotinus, time represents a prison for human beings, separating us from the divine realm -- the true and absolute reality.<br><br>Belief that God lies outside of time altogether also became the established doctrine among many early Christian thinkers, such as Augustine, Boethius and Anselm, starting a tradition that continues to the present day. Like Plato and Plotinus before him, Augustine places God in the realm of eternity, "supreme above time because it is a never-ending present." In this existence, time does not pass; rather, God perceives all times at once:<br><br>Your years are completely present to you all at one because they are at a permanent standstill. They do not move on, forced to give way before the advance of others, because they never pass at all...Your today is eternity.<br><br>Thus, the God of classical Christianity not only exists outside of time, but also knows the future as well as the past and present. These farreaching ideas have been subjected to detailed analysis and received some sharp criticism by the medieval church, as well as by modern theologians and philosophers. The core of the debate is the daunting problem of how to build a bridge between God's presumed eternity on the one hand and the manifest temporality of the physical universe on the other. Can a god who is completely atemporal logically relate in any way at all to a changing world, to human time? Surely it is impossible for God to exist <i>both</i> within and outside of time? After centuries of bitter debate, there is still no consensus among theologians about the solution to this profound conundrum. These tangled issues are reviewed in greater depth in my book <i>The Mind of God,</i> for those readers who are interested.<br><br><b>ESCAPE FROM TIME</b><br><br><i>The great thing about time is that it goes on.</i><br><br>Arthur Eddington<br><br>Although theologians and philosophers wrangle over the technicalities of the logical relationship between time and eternity, many religious people believe that the most powerful insights into the subject are provided, not by academic debate, but by direct revelation:<br><br>I remember that I was going to bathe from a stretch of shingle to which the few people who stayed in the village seldom went. Suddenly the noise of the insects was hushed. Time seemed to stop. A sense of infinite power and peace came upon me. I can best liken the combination of timelessness with amazing fullness of existence to the feeling one gets in watching the rim of a great silent fly-wheel or the unmoving surface of a deep, strongly-flowing river. Nothing happened: yet existence was completely full. All was clear.<br><br>This personal story, recounted by the physicist and Anglican bishop Ernest Barnes in his 1929 Gifford Lectures, eloquently captures the combination of timelessness and clarity so often said to be associated with mystical or religious experiences. Can a human being really escape time and glimpse eternity? In Barnes's case, as happens so often in reports from Westerners, the experience came totally out of the blue. But Eastern mystics have perfected special techniques that allegedly can induce such timeless rapture. The Tibetan monk Lama Govinda describes his own experiences thus:<br><br>The temporal sequence is converted into a simultaneous co-existence, the side-by-side existence of things into a state of mutual interpenetration...a living continuum in which time and space are integrated.<br><br>Many similar descriptions have been published of deep meditation, or even drug-induced mental states, in which human consciousness apparently escapes the confines of time, and reality appears as a timeless continuum.<br><br>The Indian philosopher Ruth Reyna believes the Vedic sages "had cosmic insights which modern man lacks...Theirs was the vision not of the present, but of the past, present, future, simultaneity, and No-Time." Sankara, the eighth-century exponent of Advaita Vedanta, taught that Brahma -- the Absolute -- is perfect and eternal in the sense of <i>absolute timelessness,</i> and thus the temporal, though real within the world of human experience, has no ultimate reality. By following the path of Self-Realization through Advaita, a truly timeless reality may be attained: "timeless not in the sense of endless duration, but in the sense of completeness, requiring neither a before nor an after," according to Reyna. "It is this astounding truth that time evaporates into unreality and Timelessness may be envisioned as the Real...that spells the uniqueness of Advaita."<br><br>The yearning for an escape from time need not involve refined meditative practices. In many cultures it is merely a pervasive yet subconscious influence -- a "terror of history," as anthropologist Mircea Eliade expresses it -- which manifests itself as a compulsive search for the Land Beyond Time. Indeed, this search is <i>the</i> founding myth of almost all human cultures. The deep human need to account for the origin of things draws us irresistibly back to a time before time, a mythical realm of timeless temporality, a Garden of Eden, a primordial paradise, its potent creativity springing from its very temporal contradictions. Whether it is Athena leaping from the head of Zeus or Mithras slaying the Bull, we encounter the same heady symbolism of a lost, timeless, perfect realm that somehow -- paradoxically, timelessly -- stands in creative relation to the immediate world of the temporal and the mortal.<br><br>This paradoxical conjunction is captured in its most developed form in the "Dreaming" concept of the Australian aborigines, sometimes referred to as the Eternal Dream Time. According to the anthropologist W. E. H. Stanner:<br><br>A central meaning of The Dreaming is that of a sacred, heroic time long, long ago when man and nature came to be as they are; but neither "time" nor "history" as we understand them is involved in this meaning. I have never been able to discover any aboriginal word for <i>time</i> as an abstract concept. And the sense of "history" is wholly alien here. We shall not understand The Dreaming fully except as a complex of meanings.<br><br>Although the Dream Time carries connotations of a heroic past age, it is wrong to think of that age as now over. "One cannot 'fix' The Dreaming in time," observes Stanner. "It was, and is, everywhen." Thus the Dreaming retains a relevance in contemporary aboriginal affairs, because it is part of the present reality; the "creator beings" are still active today. What Europeans call "the past" is, for many aboriginal people, <i>both</i> past and present. Stories of creation are often cast in what Europeans would call the recent past, even as recent as the era of white settlement. No incongruity is felt, because, for the Australian aborigine, events are more important than dates. This subtlety is lost on most European minds; we have become obsessed with rationalizing and measuring time in our everyday lives. Stanner quotes an old Australian black man who expressed this cultural gulf lyrically:<br><br><i>White man got no dreaming<br><br>Him go 'nother way.<br><br>White man, him go different,<br><br>Him got road belong himself.</i><br><br>The concept of "white man's time" as a "road" down which he marches single-mindedly is an especially apt description, I think, of Western linear time. It is a road that may perhaps lead to progress, but the psychological price we pay for embarking upon it is a heavy one. Fear of death lies at the root of so much we do and think, and with it the desperate desire to optimize the precious duration we have been allotted, to lead life to the full and accomplish something of enduring value. Modern man, wrote J. B. Priestley,<br><br>...feels himself fastened to a hawser that is pulling him inexorably toward the silence and darkness of the grave...But no idea of an "eternal dream time," where gods and heroes (from whom he is not separated for ever) have their being, comes shining through to make modern man forget his calendars and clocks, the sands of his time running out.<br><br>But even those of us who are trapped within Western culture, for whom a magical, mystical escape route from time is unavailable, can still discern the powerful ancient symbols at work in art and literature, reverberating down the ages. From <i>Paradise Lost</i> to <i>Narnia,</i> from King Arthur's Avalon to that distant galaxy far away and long ago where the <i>Star Wars</i> were fought and won, the realm of eternity has never been very far from the surface. The evocative emblems of eternity now lay shadowy and indistinct in our culture, serving merely as a seductive distraction from the commonsense "reality" of ruthless, passing time....</p><h2>The Secret Circle: The Initiation and The Captive Part I</h2><p><p><strong>With love, witchcraft, and spellbinding drama, the Secret Circle series is perfect for fans of The Vampire Diaries.</strong> </p><p>This special paperback bind-up contains the first book in the Secret Circle series, <em>The Initiation,</em> as well as part one of the second book in the series, <em>The Captive</em>; from L.J.

Four years later, he earned the elite triathlete title kona Ironman. Thousands have done each individually. Bonner is the first person with cerebral palsy to do both.</p><p>Bonner Paddock grew up just wanting to be ordinary. Despite his skinny legs and habit of tripping over nothing, he fought to keep up with his athletic older brothers, learned to battle riptides with his grandfather on close watch, and did everything he could to feel like a regular kid, even when it became clear he wasn't. After being diagnosed with cerebral palsy at age eleven, Bonner didn't let it limit him&#x2014;instead he simply ignored its existence. For the next eighteen years, he guarded the truth about his health, building a normal life and keeping his secret from everyone&#x2014;most of all himself.</p><p>But the sudden death of a friend's young son named Jake, a boy who also suffered from cerebral palsy, forced Bonner to reevaluate who he was. No longer content striving for normal, he began to pursue one breathtaking experience after another in Jake's memory, never hiding from his physical limitations and, in the process, raising international awareness about cerebral palsy. T is appetite for challenges led him to the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro where, pushing his fragile body to the brink and barely surviving, he braved one mountain only to discover that he still had farther to climb.</p><p>Embracing his weaknesses to understand his strengths, he then pursued the ultimate adventure: testing his mind, body, and will at the Ironman in Kona, Hawaii, a race regarded by many as the hardest on earth.

Douglas Kenyon has chosen forty-two essays from the bimonthly journal <em>Atlantis Rising</em> to provide readers with an overview of the positions of some of the key thinkers in today&#x2019;s supercharged debate over ancient mysteries and alternative history. Contributors include, among others, Robert Schoch, Rand Flem-Ath, Moira Timms, Frank Joseph, Christopher Dunn, and Will Hart, all of whom have played leading roles in challenging the entrenched scientific establishment to reexamine its assumptions about our forgotten origins and to consider the possibility of meaningful debate--whatever the consequences to the existing paradigm. <br><br>Kenyon has carefully built a collection of material in support of the growing challenge to such outmoded ways of thinking as Darwinism and Creationism, with each contribution building upon the work of the other authors. In these pages the latest discoveries and ideas regarding such perennially controversial topics as Atlantis, the pyramids, and extraterrestrial influence are explored, and many provocative questions are raised. What emerges is a thoughtful case in support of a much greater antiquity for civilization, a convincing argument for the existence of advanced technologies in prehistory, and the vast yet unmistakable outline of a lost fountainhead of world culture. These alternative arguments, once marginalized, are now gaining credibility and respect. <br><br>The collection also includes several articles that introduce, compare, contrast, and complement the theories of other notable authors in these fields, such as Zecharia Sitchin, Paul LaViolette, John Michell, Graham Hancock, and John Anthony West. <br><br>J.

Professor Hacking shows how by the late nineteenth century it became possible to think of statistical patterns as explanatory in themselves, and to regard the world as not necessarily deterministic in character. Combining detailed scientific historical research with characteristic philosophic breath and verve, The Taming of Chance brings out the relations among philosophy, the physical sciences, mathematics and the development of social institutions, and provides a unique and authoritative analysis of the &#34;probabilization&#34; of the Western world.</p><p>In the course of a continuing inquiry into the origins and development of contemporary thought, this study reveals how statistical patterns were finally perceived in a non-deterministic manner by the end of the late nineteenth century.In this important new study Ian Hacking continues the enquiry into the origins and development of certain characteristic modes of contemporary thought undertaking in such previous works as the best-selling The Emergence of Probability.</p><h2>Time and Chance</h2><p><p>This book is an attempt to get to the bottom of an acute and perennial tension between our best scientific pictures of the fundamental physical structure of the world and our everyday empirical experience of it. The trouble is about the direction of time. The situation (very briefly) is that it is a consequence of almost every one of those fundamental scientific pictures--and that it is at the same time radically at odds with our common sense--that whatever can happen can just as naturally happen backwards.</p><p>Albert provides an unprecedentedly clear, lively, and systematic new account--in the context of a Newtonian-Mechanical picture of the world--of the ultimate origins of the statistical regularities we see around us, of the temporal irreversibility of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, of the asymmetries in our epistemic access to the past and the future, and of our conviction that by acting now we can affect the future but not the past. Then, in the final section of the book, he generalizes the Newtonian picture to the quantum-mechanical case and (most interestingly) suggests a very deep potential connection between the problem of the direction of time and the quantum-mechanical measurement problem.</p><p>The book aims to be both an original contribution to the present scientific and philosophical understanding of these matters at the most advanced level, and something in the nature of an elementary textbook on the subject accessible to interested high-school students.</p></p><p>David Z Albert is Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University.&#x201c;Albert is perfecting a style of foundational analysis that is uniquely his own...It has a surgical precision...and it is ruthless with pretensions.

Saunders, Oxford University</b><br><br>&#x201c;As usual with Albert's work, the exposition is brisk and to the point, and exceptionally clear...The book will be an extremely valuable contribution to the literature on the subject of philosophical issues in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, a literature which has been thin on the ground but is now growing as it deserves to.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lawrence Sklar, University of Michigan</b><br><br>&#x201c;The foundations of statistical mechanisms are often presented in physics textbooks in a rather obscure and confused way.

It remains a masterwork without parallel. The distinguished historian Merle Goldman brings the book up to date, covering reforms in the post-Mao period through the early years of the twenty-first century, including the leadership of Hu Jintao.

This history of China, completed two days before his death in 1991, is a fitting final work. In covering the breadth of the country's history, from the earliest archaeological records to the present, the author is occasionally short on details, but lay readers and undergraduate students will appreciate the perceptive analysis and explanation throughout, leading to a better understanding of this complex nation, its people, and its importance in the world. Furthermore, Fairbank's command of recent research, along with an excellent bibliography, will appeal to the scholarly audience. Highly recommended. History Book Club selection.<br><i>- Kenneth W.

She lives in North Carolina.<i>Chapter One<br><br> Present day<br> </i><br><br> Nightmares again?"<br><br> Diana Brisco slipped her cold hands into the front pockets of her smock and frowned at him. "What makes you ask?"<br><br> "That." He nodded at the canvas on its easel in front of her, a canvas with a dark background and bright, harsh slashes of color in the foreground.<br><br> She joined him in staring at the canvas, and finally shrugged. "No, no nightmares." For once, at least. "Just in a mood, I guess."<br><br> "A dark mood."<br><br> "You told us to paint what we felt," she said defensively. "I did that."<br><br> He smiled, the expression lending his already angelic features such beauty that she unconsciously caught her breath.<br><br> "Yes, you did. And quite powerfully. I'm not worried about your work, Diana. It's superb, as usual. I'm concerned about you."<br><br> She mentally shook off the almost mesmerizing effect of his physical presence and ignored what she suspected was a pat-the-pupil-on-the-head compliment, saying, "I'm fine. I didn't sleep well, but not because of nightmares. Just because . . ." She shrugged again, unwilling to admit that she had been up half the night staring through her bedroom window, out over the dark valley. She had spent far too many nights that way since arriving in Leisure.<br><br> Looking for . . . something. God only knew what, because she certainly didn't.<br><br> Gently, but also matter-of-factly, he said, "Even if this workshop was designed for self-expression rather than therapy, I'd be offering the same advice, Diana. Once we're done here, get out of The Lodge for a while. Go for a walk, or a ride, or a swim. Sit out in one of the gardens with a book."<br><br> "In other words, stop thinking about myself so much."<br><br> "Stop <i>thinking.</i> For a while."<br><br> "Okay. Sure. Thanks." Diana knew she sounded brusque and wanted to apologize for it. He was only doing what he was supposed to do, after all, and probably had no idea that she'd heard it all before. But before she could form the words, he merely smiled and moved on to the next of his dozen or so "students" here in the bright, open space of the hotel's conservatory.<br><br> Diana kept her hands in the pockets of the paint-stained smock and frowned at her painting. <i>Superb</i>, huh? Yeah, right. To her eye, it looked more like the finger painting of a highly untalented six-year-old.<br><br> But, of course, quality was hardly the point. Talent was hardly the point.<br><br> Figuring out what was going on in her screwed-up mind was the point.<br><br> She took her gaze off the painting and watched as Beau Rafferty moved among his students. An artist of his caliber teaching this sort of workshop had struck her as extremely odd at first, but after a week of classes she had come to realize that he had a genuine gift not only for teaching, but also for reaching and helping troubled people.<br><br> Other people, at least. She could already see changes in most of the others participating in this workshop. Strained faces had begun to relax, smiles had appeared to replace frowns or haunted anxiety. She had even seen a few of them out enjoying some of the activities The Lodge had to offer.<br><br> But not Diana. Oh, no. Diana was still having nightmares when she could sleep at all, she couldn't remember the last time she had felt relaxed, and none of the myriad sports or recreational facilities here held the least appeal for her. And despite Rafferty's undoubted genius and ability to teach, she didn't believe that her rudimentary artistic skills had improved either.<br><br> In fact, this whole thing was probably just one more waste of her time and her father's money.<br><br> Diana looked back at her painting and hesitated for a moment before picking up her brush and adding one small streak of scarlet near the lower left corner. That finished it, she decided. She had no idea what it was or what it was supposed to represent to her, but it was finished.<br><br> She began cleaning her brushes automatically, trying to concentrate on the task and not think.<br><br> But, of course, that was part of her problem, the short attention span, these scattered, random thoughts and ideas flitting constantly through her mind, usually so fast they left her confused and disoriented at least half the time. Like bits and pieces of overheard conversations, the words and phrases came and went almost continually.<br><br> No focus, that's what the doctors said. They were sure she didn't have attention deficit disorder, despite having been medicated for that at least twice in her life; no, all the doctors and all the tests had determined that despite "somewhat elevated" levels of electrical activity, her problem wasn't physical or chemical, wasn't something in her brain--but something in her mind.<br><br> So far, none of them had been able to suggest a successful way of figuring out what that <i>something </i>was. And just about every conceivable means had been tried. The traditional couch and shrink. Hypnosis. Conscious regression, since no one had been able to hypnotize her to attempt the unconscious variety. Group therapy. Massage therapy. Various other kinds of therapy, both traditional and New Age. Including, now, painting, under the tutelage of an honest-to-God artistic genius, in yet another attempt to tap in to her inner Diana and ask what the hell was wrong with her.<br><br> One of her current doctors had suggested she try this, and Diana could only wonder if he was getting kickbacks for every referral.<br><br> Her father had spared no expense in trying to help his troubled only child, openly afraid that she might, as so many others had done, escape into alcohol or drugs or, worse, give up and commit suicide.<br><br> But Diana had never been tempted by the chemical forgetfulness that could be found in "recreational" drugs. In fact, she disliked losing control, a trait that only exacerbated her problem; the harder she tried to concentrate and focus, the more scattered her thoughts became. And the failure to control them, of course, depressed and disturbed her further, though never to the point of contemplating suicide.<br><br> Diana was no quitter. Which was why she was here, trying yet another form of therapy.<br><br> "I'll see you all back here tomorrow," Rafferty told his class, smiling, not offering a collective "Good work" because he had instead offered that individually.<br><br> Diana removed her smock and hung it on the hook at the side of the easel, and prepared to follow the others out of the conservatory.<br><br> "Diana?"<br><br> She waited, a little surprised, as Rafferty approached her.<br><br> "Take this." He held out a sketchpad and small box of watercolor pencils.<br><br> She accepted them, but with a frown. "Why? Is this some kind of exercise?"<br><br> "It's a suggestion. Keep the pad close by, and when you start to feel upset or anxious or restless, try drawing. Don't think about it, don't try to control what you draw, just draw."<br><br> "But--"<br><br> "Just let go and draw."<br><br> "This is like the inkblots, right? You're going to look at my sketches and interpret them, go all Freudian and figure out what's wrong with me?"<br><br> "I won't even see them, unless you want to show them to me. No, Diana, the sketches are just for you. They may help . . . clarify things for you."<br><br> She wondered, not for the first time, just how much he really knew about her and her demons, but didn't ask. Instead, she merely nodded. It was something she hadn't tried, so why not? "Okay, fine. <br><br> See you tomorrow."<br><br> "See you tomorrow, Diana."<br><br> She left the conservatory, going out into the gardens more because she didn't want to return to her cottage than because the gardens were an enjoyment for her. They were pretty, she supposed. Gorgeous, really, from the various themed gardens already in bloom in mid-April to the striking greenhouse that held an amazing variety of orchids.<br><br> But Diana walked through most of the charming scenery indifferently. She followed a flagstone path because it was there, crossing the arched footbridge over the man-enhanced stream holding numerous colorful koi and ending up in the supposedly serene Zen Garden, with its manicured shrubs and trees and carefully placed rocks and sand and statuary.<br><br> She sat down on a stone bench beside a weeping willow tree, telling herself she wouldn't remain long because the afternoon was waning and it got chilly this time of year as the sun dipped below the mountains. And then there was the fog, which had an unsettling tendency to creep across this valley and settle over The Lodge and its gardens so that finding one's way along the paths resembled a trip through a damp and chilly maze.<br><br> Diana definitely wasn't in the mood for that. But she nevertheless sat there longer than she had planned, finally opening the box of watercolor pencils and absently selecting one. They were already sharpened.<br><br> She opened the sketchpad and tried the pencil out just as absently, making yet another attempt to ignore the jumbled thoughts crowding her mind and concentrate on only one. Why she was having so much trouble sleeping here. It had been an issue now and then in her life, but not recently, not until she had come to The Lodge.<br><br> Nightmares had always been a problem for her, though still not regular occurrences, but since coming to The Lodge they had gotten worse. More intense, more . . . terrifying. She'd wake in the dark hours before dawn, gasping in panic yet unable to remember what it was that had so frightened her.<br><br> It was less traumatic to stay awake. Just curl up in the window seat in her bedroom, an afghan protecting her against the chill of the glass, and stare out at the valley and the dark mountains that loomed above.<br><br> Looking for . . . something. Nothing.<br><br> Waiting.</p><h2>The Story of Romans</h2><p><p>A. Katherine Grieb insightfully traces the argument of Paul's letter to the Romans and shows how it is grounded in the story of God's faithfulness to Israel.

She demonstrates the letter's relevance today and invites contemporary readers to locate their own stories within Paul's account of God's righteousness.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.<strong><p>Chapter One</p><p>743 A.L.</p></strong><p>Commerce weighs value, yet such weight is but an image, and, as such, is an illusion.</p><p>The bell announcing dinner rang twice, just twice, and no more, for it never did. Rousel leapt up from his table desk in the sitting room that adjoined our bedchambers, disarraying the stack of papers that represented a composition doubtless due in the morning. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m starved.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not. You&#x2019;re merely hungry,&#x201c; I pointed out, carefully placing a paperweight over the work on my table desk. &#x201c; &#x2018;Starved&#x2019; means great physical deprivation and lack of nourishment. We don&#x2019;t suffer either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I feel starved. Stop being such a pedant, Rhenn.&#x201d; The heels of his shoes clattered on the back stairs leading down to the pantry off the dining chamber.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Rousel couldn&#x2019;t even have pronounced &#x201c;pedant,&#x201c; but he&#x2019;d heard Master Sesiphus use it, and now he applied it to me as often as he could. Younger brothers were worse than vermin, because one could squash vermin and then bathe, something one could not do with younger brothers. With some fortune, since Father would really have preferred that I follow him as a factor but had acknowledged that I had little interest, I&#x2019;d be out of the house before Culthyn was old enough to leave the nursery and eat with us. As for Khethila, she was almost old enough, but she was quiet and thoughtful. She liked it when I read to her, even things like my history assignments about people like Rex Regis or Rex Defou. Rousel had never liked my reading to him, but then, he&#x2019;d never much cared for anything I did.</p><p>By the time I reached the dining chamber, Father was walking through the archway from the parlor where he always had a single goblet of red wine&#x2014;usually Dhuensa&#x2014;before dinner. Mother was standing behind the chair at the other end of the oval table. I slipped behind my chair, on Father&#x2019;s right. Rousel grinned at me, then cleared his face.</p><p>&#x201c;Promptness! That&#x2019;s what I like. A time and a place for everything, and everything in its time and place.&#x201d; Father cleared his throat, then set his near-empty goblet on the table and placed his hands on the back of the armed chair that was his.</p><p>&#x201c;For the grace and warmth from above, for the bounty of the earth below, for all the grace of the world and beyond, for your justice, and for your manifold and great mercies, we offer our thanks and gratitude, both now and evermore, in the spirit of that which cannot be named or imaged.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In peace and harmony,&#x201c; we all chorused, although I had my doubts about the presence and viability of either, even in L&#x2019;Excelsis, crown city and capital of Solidar.</p><p>Father settled into his chair at the end of the table with a contented sigh, and a glance at Mother. &#x201c;Thank you, dear. Roast lamb, one of my favorites, and you had Riesela fix it just the way I prefer it.&#x201d;</p><p>If Mother had told the cook to fix lamb any other way, we all would have been treated to a long lecture on the glories of crisped roast lamb and the inadequacies of other preparations.</p><p>After pouring a heavier red wine into his goblet and then into Mother&#x2019;s, Father placed the carafe before me. I took about a third of a goblet, because that was what he&#x2019;d declared as appropriate for me, and poured a quarter for Rousel.</p><p>When Father finished carving and serving, Mother passed the rice casserole and the pickled beets. I took as little as I could of the beets.</p><p>&#x201c;How was your day, dear?&#x201d; asked Mother.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh... the same as any other, I suppose. The Phlanysh wool is softer than last year, and that means that Wurys will complain. Last year he said it was too stringy and tough, and that he&#x2019;d have to interweave with the Norinygan... and the finished Extelan gray is too light... But then he&#x2019;s half Pharsi, and they quibble about everything.&#x201d;</p><p>Mother nodded. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re different. They work hard. You can&#x2019;t complain about that, but they&#x2019;re not our type.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, they&#x2019;re not, but he does pay in gold, and that means I have to listen.&#x201d;</p><p>I managed to choke down the beets while Father offered another discourse on wool and the patterned weaving looms, and the shortcomings of those from a Pharsi background. I wasn&#x2019;t about to mention that the prettiest and brightest girl at the grammaire was Remaya, and she was Pharsi.</p><p>Abruptly, he looked at me. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t seem terribly interested in what feeds you, Rhennthyl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sir... I was listening closely. You were pointing out that, while the pattern blocks used by the new weaving machinery produced a tighter thread weave, the women loom tenders have gotten more careless and that means that spoilage is up, which increases costs&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Enough. I know you listen, but I have great doubts that you care, or even appreciate what brings in the golds for this house hold. At times, I wonder if you don&#x2019;t listen to the secret whispers of the Namer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Chenkyr...&#x201d; cautioned Mother.</p><p>Father sighed as only he could sigh. &#x201c;Enough of that. What did you learn of interest at grammaire today?&#x201d;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t so much what I&#x2019;d learned as what I&#x2019;d been thinking about. &#x201c;Father... lead is heavier than copper or silver. It&#x2019;s even heavier than gold, but it&#x2019;s cheaper. I thought you said that we used copper, silver, and gold for coins because they were heavier and harder for evil imagers to counterfeit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I mean, Rhennthyl.&#x201d; He sighed even more loudly. &#x201c;You ask a question like that, but when I ask you to help in the counting house, you can&#x2019;t be bothered to work out the cost of an extra tariff of a copper... or work out the costs for guards on a summer consignment of bolts of Acoman prime wool to Nacliano. It isn&#x2019;t as though you had no head for figures, but you do not care to be accurate if something doesn&#x2019;t interest you. What metals the Council uses for coins matters little if one has no coins to count. No matter how much a man likes his work, there will be parts of it that are less pleasing&#x2014;or even displeasing. You seem to think that everything should be pleasing or interesting. Life doesn&#x2019;t oblige us in that fashion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be that hard on the boy, Chenkyr.&#x201d; Mother&#x2019;s voice was patient.</p><p>&#x201c;Not everyone is meant to be a factor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His willfulness makes an ob look flexible, Maelyna.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Even the obdurates have their place.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t help thinking I&#x2019;d rather be an obdurate than a mal. Most people were malleables of one sort or another, changing their views or opinions whenever someone roared at them, like Father.</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly!&#x201d; exclaimed Father. &#x201c;As servants to imagers and little else. I don&#x2019;t want one of my sons a lackey because he won&#x2019;t think about anything except what interests or pleases him. The world isn&#x2019;t a kind place for inflexible stubbornness and unthinking questioning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How can a question be unthinking?&#x201d; I wanted to know. &#x201c;You have to think even to ask one.&#x201d;</p><p>My father&#x2019;s sigh was more like a roar. Then he glared at me. &#x201c;When you ask a question to which you would already know the answer if you stopped to think, or when you ask a question to which no one knows the answer. In both cases, you&#x2019;re wasting your time and someone else&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But how do I know when no one knows the answer if I don&#x2019;t ask the question?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rhennthyl! There you go again. Do you want to eat cold rice in the kitchen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rousel,&#x201c; said Father, pointedly avoiding looking in my direction, &#x201c;how are you coming with your calculations and figures?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Master Sesiphus says that I have a good head for figures. My last two examinations have been perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course they had been. What was so hard about adding up columns of numbers that never changed? Or dividing them, or multiplying them? Rousel was more than a little careless about numbers and anything else when no one was looking or checking on him.</p><p>I cut several more thin morsels of the lamb. It was good, especially the edge of the meat where the fat and seasonings were all crisped together. The wine wasn&#x2019;t bad, either, but it was hard to sit there and listen to Father draw out Rousel.</p><p>Excerpted from Imager by L. E. MODESITT, JR.</p><p>Copyright ï¿½ 2009 by L. E.

They discuss their endlessly connected neighbors. They talk about a mysterious pit that opened up one day, and the old bricklayer who sometimes walked to the cemetery to cheer himself up. Anxious to show off his valuable antiques, the host shows his guests old windup toys and takes them to admire an enormous doll. Back at home, the bachelor decides to watch some late night TV before retiring. The news quickly takes a turn for the worse as, horrified, the newscaster finds herself reporting about the dead rising from their graves, leaving the cemetery, and sucking the blood of the living&#x2015;all somehow, disturbingly reminiscent of the dinner party.</p><p><p>Nominated for a Neustadt award and the Man Booker International Prize, <strong>Cï¿½sar Aira</strong> was born in Coronel Pringles, Argentina, in 1949.

With China on the rise, so, too, are the American cities of the West coast, including Seattle, San Francisco, and the long cluster of towns down the Silicon Valley.</p><p>Today, the Pacific is ascendant. Its geological history has long transformed us&#x2014;tremendous earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis&#x2014;but its human history, from a Western perspective, is quite young, beginning with Magellan&#x2019;s sixteenth-century circumnavigation. It is a natural wonder whose most fascinating history is currently being made.</p><p>In telling the story of the Pacific, Simon Winchester takes us from the Bering Strait to Cape Horn, the Yangtze River to the Panama Canal, and to the many small islands and archipelagos that lie in between. He observes the fall of a dictator in Manila, visits aboriginals in northern Queensland, and is jailed in Tierra del Fuego, the land at the end of the world. His journey encompasses a trip down the Alaska Highway, a stop at the isolated Pitcairn Islands, a trek across South Korea and a glimpse of its mysterious northern neighbor.</p><p>Winchester&#x2019;s personal experience is vast and his storytelling second to none. And his historical understanding of the region is formidable, making <em>Pacific</em> a paean to this magnificent sea of beauty, myth, and imagination that is transforming our lives.</p></p><p><p>Simon Winchester is the acclaimed author of many books, including <em>The Professor and the Madman</em>, <em>The Men Who United the States, The Map That Changed the World, The Man Who Loved China, A Crack in the Edge of the World,</em> and <em>Krakatoa</em>, all of which were <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers and appeared on numerous best and notable lists.

Based on in-depth research and direct observation of very young children, she shows in this groundbreaking book how common it is for beloved relatives to reincarnate into the same family. Typical families share how their children -- some as young as two and still in diapers -- speak spontaneously of intimate details from the lives of a family member they never knew. These true stories shed new light on age-old questions of family relationships: Do we choose our parents? What relationships survive death? What happens to the soul after a miscarriage or abortion? Bowman offers hope for anyone who has lost a beloved relative and longs to be reunited again.</p></p><p>Carol Bowman lives near Philadelphia with her husband; their two children are away in college. Through her writings, frequent lectures, and TV appearances on shows such as <em>Oprah, Good Morning America,</em> and <em>Unsolved Mysteries,</em> Bowman has opened the eyes of millions of parents to the fact that some children easily remember their past lives. She is recognized as a leading expert in this new field.<p>Bowman holds a master's degree in counseling and practices past-life-oriented counseling and therapy. She continues to promote research of children's past lives and same-family reincarnation.</p>After the publication of her last book, Children's Past Lives, Bowman was deluged with e-mails from readers wanting to share their stories. Many reported the rebirth of deceased relatives into their own families; Bowman, intrigued, set out to study the phenomenon, and she now presents her findings. Each tale is stranger than the next: a grandfather returned as a grandson, miscarried twins were transferred from their mother to her sister-in-law and were reborn years apart. Bowman admits she is not interested in "fretting about proof" for these unlikely scenarios, but the stories are gripping in and of themselves. It's testimony to their high drama that a book beginning with the truly weird and uncanny premise, "What if the child who [is] just like great-grandpa really is?" can, by the end, make it seem almost a shame not to have a returned uncle or two in the family. Bowman endeavors to present reincarnation as a whole worldview a cycle of living, dying and spiritual growth rather than the wishful thinking of bereaved hearts hoping to rob death of its finality. This book will not change anyone's mind: believers will believe, and skeptics will remain unconvinced. Bowman, a believer, gives too little credit to the virtuosic imagination of children (or for that matter adults). Undoubtedly, many readers will find comfort and meaning in her work, while others will enjoy it as a better ghost story than most. (Apr.)Forecast: Author appearances in L.A., D.C., and Chicago; a national media campaign; and a 50-city radio campaign should help this book find its audience. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Block Prints: How To Make Them</h2><p><p><i> A vintage reissue for the modern crafter</i></p> <p>An accomplished member of the early twentieth-century Arts and Crafts movement, William S.

Take, for instance, the Kentucky Club on Avenida Juï¿½rez two blocks south of the Rio Grande. It's a touchstone for each of Sï¿½enz's stories. His characters walk by, they might go in for a drink or to score, or they might just stay there for a while and let their story be told. Sï¿½enz knows that the Kentucky Club, like special watering holes in all cities, is the contrary to borders. It welcomes Spanish and English, Mexicans and gringos, poor and rich, gay and straight, drug addicts and drunks, laughter and sadness, and even despair. It's a place of rich history and good drinks and cold beer and a long polished mahogany bar. Some days it smells like piss. "I'm going home to the other side." That's a strange statement, but you hear it all the time at the Kentucky Club.</p><p><b>Benjamin Alire Sï¿½enz </b>is a highly regarded writer of fiction, poetry, and children's literature.

Read every word of his stories lest you miss some clever twist, some subtle irony, some gentle nuance of poetic imagery that he has labored to create." <b>Booklist</b><br><br>"Seven stunningly evocative short stories a haunting tableau of characters wrestling with the boons and burdens of existence Saenz, with these masterfully hewn stories, presents this hardscrabble yet tenacious city as beautiful in its contradictions, disquieting in its ambiguities, and heartbreaking in its quotidianness. Filtered through this book are the lives of its singular people: doomed, broken, resourceful, and, above all else, faithful to the city and to the parts they play in its intricate dimensions." &#x2014; <b>Texas Books in Review</b><br><br>"Though the prolific Benjamin Alire Sï¿½enz has been writing books in every genre for the past two decades, <i>Everything Begins and Ends at the Kentucky Club</i> is only his second short-story collection. But the wait was definitely worth it [The story "He Has Gone to Be with the Women"] is nothing short of a masterpiece In one story, a school counselor says the following about his troubled charges: "They came to me with a thirst in their eyes, a thirst, such a thirst and I knew that I could never give them the rain they deserved, the rain they so desperately needed." That might as well be The Kentucky Club speaking, since every protagonist in this heartbreaking collection of stories finds his way to a confession stool at the bar. They find no solutions to their ills, just a sensitive ear that has heard it all before but is willing to listen once again."

As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity over the long run, but the immediate consequences of mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with the Computer Revolution.</p><p>Just as the Industrial Revolution eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society, artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across Europe and China. Today&#x2019;s despairing middle class has not resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there&#x2019;s no assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few grasped its enormous consequences at the time. <i>The Technology Trap</i> demonstrates that in the midst of another technological revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more effectively face the present.</p></p><p>Argues that we can better understand the challenges provided by new technology and AI to the future of work by drawing on the lessons of the past.<b>Carl Benedikt Frey</b> is the Oxford Martin Citi Fellow and codirector of the Oxford Martin Programme on Technology and Employment at the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford.

This formerly esoteric, little-known brew is now a growth industry. But why?<br><br>Ayahuasca is a psychoactive brew that has a long history of ritual use among indigenous groups of the Upper Amazon.

Part 3 examines the medicinal plants of the Amazon, looking particularly at the ingredients in ayahuasca and their therapeutic qualities, covering the most up-to-date biomedical research, psychedelic science and psychopharmacology.

Colonizers who followed the explorers used these claims to justify the displacement of Native groups from their lands.

This book is the first comprehensive overview of how Northwest Coast Native Americans managed the landscape and cared for the plant communities on which they depended.<br><br>Bringing together some of the world's most prominent specialists on Northwest Coast cultures, Keeping It Living tells the story of traditional plant cultivation practices found from the Oregon coast to Southeast Alaska.

The two men collaborated closely in the successful American wars in Panama and Iraq during the presidency of George H. W. Bush &#x2013; but from this pinnacle, conflicts of ideology and sensibility drove them apart. Returning to government service under George W.

Without this body against your body there is no place. I envy people who miss their mother. Or miss a place or know something called home. The absence of a body against my body created a gap, a hole, a hunger. This hunger determined my life.</p> <p>I have been exiled from my body. I was ejected at a very young age and I got lost. I did not have a baby. I have been afraid of trees. I have felt the Earth as my enemy. I did not live in the forests. I lived in the concrete city where I could not see the sky or sunset or stars. I moved at the pace of engines and it was faster than my own breath. I became a stranger to myself and to the rhythms of the Earth. I aggrandized my alien identity and wore black and felt superior. My body was a burden. I saw it as something that unfortunately had to be maintained. I had little patience for its needs.</p> <p><br>The absence of a body against my body made attachment abstract. Made my own body dislocated and unable to rest or settle. A body pressed against your body is the beginning of nest. I grew up not in a home but in a kind of free fall of anger and violence that led to a life of constant movement, of leaving and falling. It is why at one point I couldn&#x2019;t stop drinking and fucking. Why I needed people to touch me all the time. It had less to do with sex than location. When you press against me, or put yourself inside me. When you hold me down or lift me up, when you lie on top of me and I can feel your weight, I exist. I am here.</p> <p><br>For years I have been trying to find my way back to my body, and to the Earth. I guess you could say it has been a preoccupation. Although I have felt pleasure in both the Earth and my body, it has been more as a visitor than as an inhabitant. I have tried various routes to get back. Promiscuity, anorexia, performance art. I have spent time by the Adriatic and in the green Vermont mountains, but always I have felt estranged, just as I was estranged from my own mother. I was in awe of her beauty but could not find my way in. Her breasts were not the breasts that fed me. Everyone admired my mother in her tight tops and leggings, with her hair in a French twist, as she drove through our small rich town in her yellow convertible. One gawked at my mother. One desired my mother. And so I gawked and desired the Earth and my mother, and I despised my own body, which was not her body. My body that I had been forced to evacuate when my father invaded and then violated me. And so I lived as a breathless, rapacious machine programmed for striving and accomplishment. Because I did not, could not, inhabit my body or the Earth, I could not feel or know their pain. I could not intuit their unwillingness or refusals, and I most certainly never knew the boundaries of enough. I was driven. I called it working hard, being busy, on top of it, making things happen. But in fact, I could not stop. Stopping would mean experiencing separation, loss, tumbling into a suicidal dislocation.</p> <p>As I had no reference point for my body, I began to ask other women about their bodies, in particular their vaginas (as I sensed vaginas were important). This led me to writing The Vagina Monologues, which then led me to talking incessantly and obsessively about vaginas. I did this in front of many strangers. As a result of me talking so much about vaginas, women started telling me stories about their bodies. I crisscrossed the Earth in planes, trains, and jeeps. I was hungry for the stories of other women who had experienced violence and suffering. These women and girls had also become exiled from their bodies and they, too, were desperate for a way home. I went to over sixty countries. I heard about women being molested in their beds, flogged in their burqas, acid-burned in their kitchens, left for dead in parking lots. I went to Jalalabad, Sarajevo, Alabama, Port-au-Prince, Peshawar, Pristina. I spent time in refugee camps, in burned-out buildings and backyards, in dark rooms where women whispered their stories by flashlight. Women showed me their ankle lashes and melted faces, the scars on their bodies from knives and burning cigarettes. Some could no longer walk or have sex. Some became quiet and disappeared. Others became driven machines like me.</p> <p><br>Then I went somewhere else. I went outside what I thought I knew. I went to the Congo and I heard stories that shattered all the other stories. In 2007 I landed in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo. I heard stories that got inside my body. I heard about a little girl who couldn&#x2019;t stop peeing on herself because huge men had shoved themselves inside her. I heard about an eighty-year-old woman whose legs were broken and torn out of their sockets when the soldiers pulled them over her head and raped her. There were thousands of these stories. The stories saturated my cells and nerves. I stopped sleeping. All the stories began to bleed together. The raping of the Earth. The pillaging of minerals. The destruction of vaginas. They were not separate from each other or from me.</p> <p>In the Congo there has been a war raging for almost thirteen years. Nearly eight million people have died and hundreds of thousands of women have been raped and tortured. It is an economic war fought over minerals that belong to the Congolese but are pillaged by the world. There are local and foreign militias from Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda. They enter villages and they murder. They rape wives in front of their husbands. They force the husbands and sons to rape their daughters and sisters. They shame and destroy families and take over the villages and the mines. The minerals are abundant in the Congo&#x2014;tin, copper, gold, and coltain, which are used in our iPhones and PlayStations and computers.</p> <p>Of course by the time I got to the Congo, I had witnessed the epidemic of violence toward women that scoured the planet, but the Congo was where I witnessed the end of the body, the end of humanity, the end of the world. Femicide, the systematic rape, torture, and destruction of women and girls, was being employed as a military/corporate tactic to secure minerals. Thousands and thousands of women were not only exiled from their bodies, but their bodies and the functions and futures of their bodies were rendered obsolete: wombs and vaginas permanently destroyed.</p> <p>The Congo and the individual horror stories of her women consumed me. Here I began to see the future&#x2014;a monstrous vision of global disassociation and greed that not only allowed but encouraged the eradication of the female species in pursuit of minerals and wealth. But I found something else here as well. Inside these stories of unspeakable violence, inside the women of the Congo, was a determination and a life force I had never witnessed. There was grace and gratitude, fierceness and readiness. Inside this world of atrocities and horror was a red-hot energy on the verge of being born. The women had hunger and dreams, demands and a vision. They conceived of a place, a concept, called City of Joy. It would be their sanctuary. It would be a place of safety, of healing, of gathering strength, of coming together, of releasing their pain and trauma. A place where they would declare their joy and power. A place where they would rise as leaders. I, along with my team and the board at V-Day, were committed to finding the resources and energy to help them build it. We would work with UNICEF to do the construction and then, after V-Day, would find the way to support it. The process of building was arduous and seemingly impossible&#x2014;delayed by rain and lack of roads and electricity, corrupt building managers, poor oversight by UNICEF, and rising prices. We were scheduled to open in May, but on March 17, 2010, they discovered a huge tumor in my uterus.</p> <p><br>Cancer threw me through the window of my disassociation into the center of my body&#x2019;s crisis. The Congo threw me deep into the crisis of the world, and these two experiences merged as I faced the disease and what I felt was the beginning of the end.</p> <p><br>Suddenly the cancer in me was the cancer that is everywhere. The cancer of cruelty, the cancer of greed, the cancer that gets inside people who live downstream from chemical plants, the cancer inside the lungs of coal miners. The cancer from the stress of not achieving enough, the cancer of buried trauma. The cancer that lives in caged chickens and oil-drenched fish. The cancer of carelessness. The cancer in fast-paced must-make-it-have-it-smoke-it-own-it formaldehydeasbestospesticideshairdyecigarettescellphonesnow. My body was no longer an abstraction. There were men cutting into it and tubes coming out of it and bags and catheters draining it and needles bruising it and making it bleed. I was blood and poop and pee and puss. I was burning and nauseous and feverish and weak. I was of the body, in the body. I was body. Body. Body. Body. Cancer, a disease of pathologically dividing cells, burned away the walls of my separateness and landed me in my body, just as the Congo landed me in the body of the world.</p> <p><br>Cancer was an alchemist, an agent of change. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. I am no apologist for cancer. I am fully aware of the agony of this disease. I appreciate every medical advance that has enabled me to be alive right now. I wake up every day and run my hand over my torso-length scar and am in awe that I had doctors and surgeons who were able to remove the disease from my body. I am humbled that I got to live where there are CAT scan machines and chemotherapy and that I had the money to pay for them through insurance. Absolutely none of these things are givens for most people in the world. I am particularly grateful for the women of the Congo whose strength, beauty, and joy in the midst of horror insisted I rise above my self-pity. I know their ongoing prayers also saved my life. I am in awe that it happens to be 2012, not twenty years ago even. I am gratefully aware that at just about any other point in history I would have been dead at fifty-seven.</p> <p>In his book, The Emperor of All Maladies, Siddhartha Mukherjee says, &#x201c;Science is often described as an interactive and cumulative process, a puzzle solved piece by piece with each piece contributing a few hazy pixels to a much larger picture.&#x201d; Science, then, is not unlike a CAT scan, a three-dimensional magnetic electronic beam that captures images as it rotates around the body.

He lives in Boston, Massachusetts.<i>Starred Review.</i> According to Nietzsche, "Every great philosophy is... a personal confession of its creator and a kind of involuntary and unperceived memoir.". Stewart affirms this maxim in his colorful reinterpretation of the lives and works of 17th-century philosophers Spinoza and Leibniz. In November 1676, the foppish courtier Leibniz, "the ultimate insider... an orthodox Lutheran from conservative Germany," journeyed to The Hague to visit the self-sufficient, freethinking Spinoza, "a double exile... an apostate Jew from licentious Holland." A prodigious polymath, Leibniz understood Spinoza's insight that "science was in the process of rendering the God of revelation obsolete; that it had already undermined the special place of the human individual in nature." Spinoza embraced this new world. Seeing the orthodox God as a "prop for theocratic tyranny," he articulated the basic theory for the modern secular state. Leibniz, on the other hand, spent the rest of his life championing God and theocracy like a defense lawyer defending a client he knows is guilty. He elaborated a metaphysics that was, at bottom, a reaction to Spinoza and collapses into Spinozism, as Stewart deftly shows. For Stewart, Leibniz's reaction to Spinoza and modernity set the tone for "the dominant form of modern philosophy"&#x2014;a category that includes Kant, Hegel, Bergson, Heidegger and "the whole 'postmodern' project of deconstructing the phallogocentric tradition of western thought." Readers of philosophy may find much to disagree with in these arguments, but Stewart's wit and profluent prose make this book a fascinating read. <i>(Jan. 2006)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He died in 2014.CHAPTER 1<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> GERMANY<br> &nbsp;<br> The muffled sounds of the nearby explosions cut through his sleep-fog and Lt. Paul Morrell leaped from his cot. A surge of fear ruined his warm and pleasant dream about his girlfriend, Debbie Winston. He grabbed his carbine and ran outside the tent and looked for the source, all the while trying to ignore the nausea and splitting headache that assailed him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another explosion came from behind the low hill just to the rear of the camp.<br> &nbsp;<br> Morrell looked about for help as he ran up the hill. No one was around. They were probably still out celebrating the end of the war, although it sounded as if someone didn&#x2019;t believe it. Could they be under attack from some Nazi fanatics? It sure as hell sounded like it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another blast jarred him. He breasted the hill on the run and looked down below him. Then he started swearing softly. Two of his soldiers, Sgt. Cecil Wiles and Cpl. Tommy Nevins, were standing by the stream that ran through the gentle valley. Wiles, staggering ever so slightly, pulled the pin on a grenade and lofted it into the center of a wider section of the stream that formed a nice little pond.<br> &nbsp;<br> Water geysered up from the pond and so did a number of dead fish. Wiles and Nevins whooped loudly at the sight.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What the hell are you men doing?&#x201d; Morrell snapped as he approached. He was furious at their stupidity and enormously relieved that he was not again at war. The two NCOs looked at him dumbly, then Wiles made a waving motion with his arm that might have been a drunken attempt at a salute.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fishing,&#x201d; Wiles said, then after a long pause, &#x201c;sir. We are fucking fishing.&#x201d; Nevins giggled at the witticism and almost fell into the water.<br> &nbsp;<br> Morrell looked about. The banks of the stream were littered with dead fish. Some had been blown to pieces by the grenades, while others had had their lives snuffed out by the concussion.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Morrell snarled, &#x201c;this is enough.&#x201d; His anger was growing. Not only had they scared the crap out of him, but they were endangering themselves along with anyone else in the vicinity. They were destroying government equipment as well as blowing up someone&#x2019;s private property. Worse, his headache was throbbing and he felt as if he would heave.<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t the first time the duo of Nevins and Wiles had gotten into trouble, usually alcohol-related. Even when sober they were only marginally efficient. He wondered just how they had gotten their stripes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why is it enough, Lieutenant?&#x201d; Wiles asked with mock innocence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Morrell iterated the reasons and added a last one. &#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m ordering you to, that&#x2019;s why.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nevins hiccuped. &#x201c;Lieutenant, why don&#x2019;t you fuck off.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Morrell was stunned and took a deep breath to calm himself. &#x201c;Tell you what. You&#x2019;re both drunk, and so&#x2019;s probably half the army. Now I&#x2019;m gonna be a real nice guy and pretend I didn&#x2019;t hear that. You two get back to camp right now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nevins&#x2019;s face flushed in anger and he looked as if he might take a swing at Morrell. However, he quickly thought better of it. Along with being an officer and someone you just didn&#x2019;t hit, Morrell was sober and fit-looking. At five-eleven, he weighed a compact 180, and despite his curly blond hair and innocent-looking blue eyes, Morrell looked as if he could take care of himself, especially in a fight with two staggering drunks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Sergeant Wiles. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not forget about it. What the hell&#x2019;s the matter with you, Lieutenant? You know you got a reputation around here as being the choirboy officer. You&#x2019;re a pain in the ass, Lieutenant. Look, the war&#x2019;s over and we got a right to celebrate, and if you don&#x2019;t like it, why don&#x2019;t you get the fuck back to your tent and stay there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Morrell was livid with anger. He&#x2019;d been with the outfit only a short time in comparison with many others, and he knew he wasn&#x2019;t getting respect from many of the men. Second lieutenants were the lowest of the officer ranks and all too often the butt of jokes by others with more experience. A joke, or even a veiled insult, he could deal with, but this was outright insubordination.<br> &nbsp;<br> He turned to Wiles. &#x201c;I think you and your little pal have gone too far. I regret this, but I am going to see Captain Maxwell.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wiles and Nevins looked at each other, then burst out laughing. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; said Wiles, &#x201c;you go see the captain. You just do that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Morrell turned and, in a rage, his headache and hangover forgotten, almost ran the half mile to where Captain Maxwell had set up shop.<br> &nbsp;<br> Captain Maxwell had commandeered an old two-story farmhouse that had escaped the ravages of both the German retreat and the American advance. Like so many places in Germany outside the major cities, the area in which they were camped looked as if nothing had changed in it for a hundred years. Whenever he saw Maxwell&#x2019;s ornate headquarters, Morrell was reminded of the story of Hansel and Gretel.<br> &nbsp;<br> Maxwell&#x2019;s clerk looked uncomfortable at Morrell&#x2019;s request, but told him the captain would be downstairs in a minute. Morrell nodded and went into the living room, which served as the captain&#x2019;s office. Maxwell, a stocky National Guard officer about thirty years old, arrived and waved him to a chair. Morrell briefly explained the situation regarding the grenade-tossing and the two NCOs&#x2019; drunken insubordination. The captain lit a cigarette and stared at the ceiling.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dammit,&#x201d; Maxwell finally said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Captain?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lieutenant, how long you been with us?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;About three months. Just before the Nazis finally surrendered.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Maxwell leaned forward. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, just before the war ended. That means you came in on the ass end of a lot of fighting those boys had been going through for more than a year. You even replaced an officer who, while not particularly smart, was fairly well liked. So, how much combat did you see?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Morrell flushed. &#x201c;Not much at all, Captain.&#x201d; Only a few minutes, and he&#x2019;d been scared to death and scarcely able to function. It was nothing in comparison with what the others had gone through, even the two assholes, Nevins and Wiles.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, and what were you doing a year ago?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I had just finished college and been called up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Lieutenant, you finished college. Then you did your basic training in the good ol&#x2019; US of A, became an officer, and then got your butt shipped over here to us just in time to see the curtain go down. Do you know what we were doing a year ago? We had just arrived in France and had begun shooting our way across Europe. Know what I was doing four years ago?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, Captain.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was managing a grocery store with my father. Then I got called up, and while I was gone, my dad died and they had to sell the store. All that while you were starting college and maybe reading War and Peace. When you go back, you&#x2019;ll have a degree and a future, but for people like me and a lot of others out there, there&#x2019;ll be nothing but shit for a future.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Captain, are you saying I should have let them keep doing what they were doing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why not? They were just a couple of hillbilly assholes blowing up some grenades we don&#x2019;t need anymore and killing some kraut fish. Think, Lieutenant, what should you have really done?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Morrell took a chair and sat down. His anger ebbed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. I should have taken any remaining grenades off them and left them there to do whatever they wished. If they had protested, I should have gone back for you or someone else to help me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Maxwell relaxed after his tirade. &#x201c;Paul, it gets worse. You want me to discipline those guys and I&#x2019;ll do it, only it&#x2019;ll just be an ass-chewing and nothing more. They know they deserve to lose their stripes, but it&#x2019;ll be their word against yours as to what they said, and you know they&#x2019;ll both lie like rugs. When I&#x2019;m through chewing on them, they&#x2019;ll go back to their ugly friends and laugh at you because they got away with fucking with you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Maxwell stood and paced the little room. &#x201c;Look, I dislike those two clowns as much as the next guy, but they&#x2019;re veterans, NCOs, and heroes with Bronze Stars, even though they&#x2019;ll steal anything that ain&#x2019;t nailed down.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Maxwell told him that the two men had been ambushed by some Germans and had to shoot their way out, thus getting their medals. In his opinion, they had been looting a farmhouse when the Germans caught them, which made their fighting their way out something less than heroic.<br> Damn, thought Paul. He had really screwed up.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It gets worse, Paul. They&#x2019;ve got more than enough points to be discharged. So, in a couple of months, maybe sooner, they&#x2019;ll be home screwing their women and their sheep, and newcomers like you&#x2019;ll be here trying to run an occupation army. Who knows, maybe I&#x2019;ll be away from here too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Morrell seized on the comment. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s the point, Captain, we are still an army, not a mob. Those guys are destroying what we came here to liberate.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Maxwell laughed harshly. &#x201c;Liberate? Let me tell you something, Lieutenant; we liberated Belgium and France, but not Germany. This fucking country we conquered with a lot of our friends getting killed or wounded in the process, and there&#x2019;s a helluva lot of difference.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To the victor belong the spoils?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But what about our orders to maintain discipline and protect the people?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The question amused Maxwell. &#x201c;Things don&#x2019;t always work out like they were intended, now do they? Take Ike&#x2019;s nonfraternization order, for instance. Did anyone really think they could keep a couple of million horny GIs away from German pussy when the kraut chicks will give you anything you want for some cigarettes, or chocolate, or even a meal? Hell, the Russians are raping them wholesale and we&#x2019;re willing to pay for it. That makes us the good guys.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grudgingly Paul agreed. That particular order truly was nonsense.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And, Lieutenant, I am also supposed to employ Germans to run this area and get their local economy going again. Only orders say I can&#x2019;t use anyone who was a Nazi. Now tell me, just who the hell does that leave in a country where even the little krauts became Nazis before they could walk and wore swastikas on their diapers? Communists, that&#x2019;s who, and the brass&#x2019;d kill me if I used commies to run the joint. At any rate, there aren&#x2019;t too many commies left after Herr Hitler got through with them, so I work with what I got, and that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re going to do as well.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>My Life with Things: The Consumer Diaries</h2><p>Unconventional and provocative, <i>My Life with Things</i> is Elizabeth Chin's meditation on her relationship with consumer goods and a critical statement on the politics and method of anthropology. Chin centers the book on diary entries that focus on everyday items&#x2014;kitchen cabinet knobs, shoes, a piano&#x2014;and uses them to intimately examine the ways consumption resonates with personal and social meaning: from writing love haikus about her favorite nail polish and discussing the racial implications of her tooth cap, to revealing how she used shopping to cope with a miscarriage and contemplating how her young daughter came to think that she needed Lunesta. Throughout, Chin keeps Karl Marx and his family's relationship to their possessions in mind, drawing parallels between Marx's napkins, the production of late nineteenth-century table linens, and Chin's own vintage linen collection. Unflinchingly and refreshingly honest, Chin unlocks the complexities of her attachments to, reliance on, and complicated relationships with her things. In so doing, she prompts readers to reconsider their own consumption, as well as their assumptions about the possibilities for creative scholarship.</p><p>Elizabeth Chin is Professor of Media Design Practices at Art Center College of Design and the author of <i>Purchasing Power: Black Kids and American Consumer Culture</i>."In <i>My Life With Things</i> Elizabeth Chin offers a smart and fascinating look at the historical, political, personal, and material specificity of people's relationship to commodities.

From Hong Kong, where people actually live in self-contained hotels, to Atlanta's Olympic Village, which seems to inadvertently commemorate a sort of corporate universalism, to Japan, where in the midst of alien surfaces his apartment building is called "The Memphis," Iyer ponders what the word "home" can possibly mean in a world whose face is blurred by its cultural fusion and its alarmingly rapid rate of change.</p><p>Pico Iyer's book of essays about international locales contends that the modern world-scurrying citizen, pushed by business demands or political migrations, can easily lose both roots and sense of home. Airports have morphed into cities where scores of languages are spoken, thousands work, and millions travel through mazed villages of McDonalds, massage parlors, and self-help groups that twist along for miles; the Dallas-Fort Worth airport alone grabs more space than Manhattan. And city life is no different: Iyer's apartment building also houses an immigration office, banks, four cinemas, dozens of restaurants and nearly 100 boutiques; the technologically plugged-in businessman with whom he stays has five phones across the world, a dozen international bank accounts, and travels more than a pilot.<p> Whether in Toronto--where in larger schools nearly 80 languages may be heard--London, or at the Olympics in Atlanta, Iyer witnesses the overlapping of hundreds of heterogeneous cultures, often pushed by corporate concerns toward commercial homogeneity and powered by technology that offers an office in the sky. The picture painted by Iyer--himself a confused and well-traveled multicultural citizen--is extreme, sci-fi, and futuristic even though set in the present: a global village turned spinning metropolis, with so many fragments set loose in its gyrations that it threatens to explode the minds of its residents. But even this shell-shocked world traveler finds peace, concluding that a simpler life may be a richer one and that home is simply where the frazzled mind decides it will be. In an era when new frontiers open monthly, when frequent flyer miles serve as currency, and constant change may be a lifestyle demand, Iyer's frantic words and dizzying images may prove as prophetic as Alvin Toffler's <i>Future Shock</i>. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p>"Powerful and essential reading for anyone trying to understand the modern world."&#x2013;<i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></p><h2>Scorched Eggs (A Cackleberry Club Mystery)</h2><p><b>The ladies of the Cackleberry Club cafï¿½ serve up justice in the latest installment from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Eggs in a Casket</i>.</b><br><br>TIME TO EGGS-TINGUISH AN ARSONIST.<br><br>Getting her hair colored at Root 66, Suzanne is stunned to witness the County Services office next door suddenly go up in flames.

Especially since she was sprawled in a red plastic chair roughly the size of a Tilt-a-Whirl car, bravely enduring her &#x201c;beauty experience&#x201d; at Root 66, downtown Kindred&#x2019;s premier hair salon. Silver foils that looked like baked-potato wrappers were crimped in her hair, while a sparkly pink &#x2019;50s-era bubble-top hair dryer hovered above her head, blasting a constant stream of hot air.</p><p>Yup, the foils were bad enough, but the droning dryer made Suzanne feel as if her head were being sucked into a jet engine.</p><p>Jiggling her foot, tapping her fingers, Suzanne knew she should try to regard this as &#x201c;me time&#x201d; as so many women&#x2019;s magazines advocated.</p><p>But, all cards on the table, Suzanne felt restless and a little guilty about ducking out of the Cackleberry Club, the cozy little cafï¿½ she ran with her two partners, Toni and Petra. She&#x2019;d dashed away this Friday afternoon claiming a dire personal emergency. And when you were a silvered blonde who was a tad over forty, the emergence of dark, scuzzy roots all over your head definitely qualified as an emergency.</p><p>But now, after all the rigmarole of mixing and tinting and crimping and blow-drying, Suzanne just dreamt of sweet escape.</p><p>She glanced around at the five other women, customers in the salon, who seemed perfectly content to sit and be beautified. But scrunched here, paging through an old copy of <i>Star Whacker</i> magazine and reading about the questionable exploits of Justin and Miley, didn&#x2019;t seem like the most productive way to spend an afternoon.</p><p>&#x201c;How you doin&#x2019;, gorgeous?&#x201d; cooed Brett. He bent down and flashed his trademark pussycat grin. Brett was her stylist and a co-owner of Root 66. A man who wore his hair bleached, spiked, and gelled. &#x201c;Are you in need of a little more pampering? Should I send Krista over to do a French manicure?&#x201d; He cast a slightly disapproving glance at Suzanne&#x2019;s blunt-cut nails.</p><p>&#x201c;No thanks, I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; Suzanne told him as she balled her hands into tight fists. What she wanted to tell Brett was that she had working-girl hands. Every day she muscled tables, swept floors, hauled in boxes of groceries, and wrangled two unruly dogs when she finally arrived home at night. In her free time, she stacked hay bales, mucked stalls, and guided her quarter horse, Mocha Gent, through his paces at barrel racing. Oh, and last week, on an egg run to Calico Farms, she&#x2019;d manhandled a jack and changed a flat tire on her Ford Taurus. Lifestyles of the rich and famous? Here in small-town Kindred? Like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not.</p><p>Suzanne poked a finger at an annoying tendril of hair that tickled the back of her neck. <i>Ten more minutes</i>, she told herself. <i>Gotta white</i> <i>knuckle it for ten more minutes. Then I&#x2019;m outta here.</i></p><p>She knew she should relax and let herself be coddled, but there were things that needed to be done. Kit Kaslik&#x2019;s vintage wedding was tomorrow and she had to figure out what to wear. Toni was babbling about launching a new book club. Her horse, Mocha Gent, still wasn&#x2019;t ready for the Logan County Fair. And Petra was all freaked out about the dinner theater that was coming up fast. And what else? Oh man. She&#x2019;d gone and invited her boyfriend, Sam, over for dinner next week. And hadn&#x2019;t he promised to bring a bottle of Cabernet if she grilled a steak for him? Yes, she was pretty sure they&#x2019;d struck that particular deal.</p><p>Suzanne drummed her fingers. She wasn&#x2019;t high maintenance, but she was definitely a high-achieving type A. Even so, she projected a certain calm and sense of poise, looking polished but not prim today in a soft denim shirt that was casually knotted at the waist of her trim white jeans. But underneath that denim shirt beat the heart of a racehorse&#x2014;a thoroughbred who was smart, kind, and the kind of crackerjack businesswoman who could drive a hard bargain or negotiate a sticky contract.</p><p>Suzanne shifted in her chair. She figured she had to be parboiled by now. After all, that wasn&#x2019;t her morning spritz of Miss Dior that was wafting through the air. In fact, it smelled more like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what?</p><p>A few inches of sludgy French roast burning in the back room&#x2019;s Mr. Coffee? A cranked-up curling iron? Someone&#x2019;s hair being fricasseed by hot rollers?</p><p>Suzanne peered around suspiciously. Maybe it was Mrs. Krauser, who was tucked under the hair dryer directly across from her. Mrs. Krauser with a swirl of blue hair that perfectly matched her light blue puffed-sleeve blouse.</p><p>Wait a minute. Now she really did smell smoke!</p><p>Suzanne wiggled her nose and sniffed suspiciously. Was it her? Was <i>her</i> hair getting singed?</p><p>Tentatively, she touched a hand to the back of her head. She was warm but not overly done. So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. okay. Peering around again, she felt a faint prickle of anxiety. It had to be Mrs. Krauser over there, blotting at her pink cheeks with a white lace hankie.</p><p><i>But wait</i>, Suzanne told herself. There was something definitely going on. Something cooking. And it wasn&#x2019;t Brett&#x2019;s complimentary snickerdoodle cookies from his back-room oven.</p><p>So where on earth was that smell coming from?</p><p>Suzanne ducked her head out from beneath the behemoth hair dryer and gazed around the salon, where everything seemed copasetic.</p><p>Still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it really did smell like smoke. And were her eyes deceiving her, or did everything suddenly look slightly ethereal and hazy? Like she was peering through a gelled lens?</p><p>Holy crap on a cracker! That <i>was</i> smoke!</p><p>Suzanne scrambled to her feet so fast every pair of eyes in the place was suddenly focused on her.</p><p>&#x201c;I think there&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; she said, and then hesitated. Standing in the middle of the beauty shop, with everyone staring at her, she felt a little unsure of herself now. No sense making a ruckus over nothing. But when she inhaled, she definitely detected a nasty, acrid burning scent. A scent that touched the limbic portion of her brain and sent a trickle of fear down her spine.</p><p><i>Smoke. I definitely smell smoke.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Something&#x2019;s on fire!&#x201d; Suzanne cried out, trying to make herself heard above the roar of the blow-dryers and the blare of show tunes playing over multiple sets of speakers.</p><p>Brett looked up from where he was shampooing a client. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; He sounded puzzled as bubbles dripped from his hands. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s what?&#x201d;</p><p>But Suzanne had already crossed the linoleum floor in three decisive strides and was pushing her way out the front door. On the sidewalk, smack-dab in the middle of downtown Kindred, the summer breeze caught her. It ripped the foils from her hair and sent her purple cape swirling out around her as if she were some kind of superhero.</p><p>And as Suzanne stood there, arms akimbo, knowing something was horribly wrong, she heard a terrifying roar. A rumble like the 4:10 Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight train speed-balling its way through Kindred. Within moments, the roar intensified, building to such a furious pitch that it sounded as if a tornado was barreling down upon the entire town. And then, without any warning whatsoever, the windows in the redbrick building right next door to Root 66 suddenly exploded with an earsplitting, heart-stopping blast. And a molten blizzard of jagged glass, chunks of brick, and wooden splinters belched out into the street!</p><p>Suzanne ducked as shards of glass shot past her like arrows! She felt the intense heat as giant tongues of red and orange flames belched from the blown-out windows as if they&#x2019;d been spewed by World War II flamethrowers.</p><p>Fearing for her life, her self-preservation instinct kicking in big-time, Suzanne dove behind a large blue metal sign that proudly proclaimed Logan County Historic Site<i>. </i>She buried her face in her hands to shield herself from flying debris, hunched her shoulders, and prayed for deliverance.</p><p>A few moments later, Suzanne peered out tentatively and was<i> </i>shocked to see that the entire building, the old brick building that housed the County Services Bureau, was completely engulfed in flames!</p><p>Like a scene out of a Bruce Willis action flick, people suddenly came streaming out of all the surrounding businesses. Realtors, bakers, bankers, and druggists, all screaming hysterically, waving their arms and pointing at what had become a roiling, broiling inferno right in the middle of Main Street. Everyone seemed hysterical, yet nobody was doing much of anything to help.</p><p>&#x201c;Call 911!&#x201d; Suzanne yelped to Jenny Probst, who ran the Kindred Bakery with her husband, Bill.</p><p>Jenny nodded frantically. &#x201c;We called. We already called. Fire department&#x2019;s on its way.&#x201d;</p><p>Two minutes later, a fire engine roared to the scene. A dozen firemen jumped off the shiny red truck even as they struggled to pull on heavy protective coats and helmets.</p><p>&#x201c;There are people in there!&#x201d; Suzanne cried to the fireman who seemed to be in charge. She pointed desperately at the building that was now a wild torrent of flames. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to get them out!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stand back, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; ordered one of the firemen, and Suzanne did. She retreated a few steps and took her place in the middle of the street along with the rapidly growing crowd.</p><p>A second fire truck arrived and a metal ladder was quickly cranked up to a second-floor window. To shouts of encouragement from the onlookers, a fireman gamely scrambled up. Then a siren blatted loudly directly behind Suzanne, giving its authoritative <i>whoop whoop</i>, and she was forced to move out of the way again. Sheriff Roy Doogie had arrived in his official maroon and tan cruiser, along with two nervous-looking deputies.</p><p>Sheriff Doogie, by no means a small man, hopped out and immediately began to bully the crowd back even farther.</p><p>&#x201c;Get back! Give &#x2019;em room to work!&#x201d; Doogie shouted as his khaki bulk quivered. &#x201c;Get out of the way!&#x201d;</p><p>Then a white ambulance came screaming into the fray and rocked to a stop directly next to Doogie&#x2019;s cruiser. Two grim-faced EMTs jumped out, pulling a metal gurney with them, ready to lend medical assistance.</p><p><i>Thank goodness</i>, Suzanne thought.</p><p>When Suzanne glanced up again, she was thankful to see a terrified-looking woman and a small child clambering over a second-story window ledge and into the waiting arms of the fireman on the ladder.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Annie Wolfson,&#x201d; said a voice behind her.</p><p>Suzanne turned around and found Ricky Wilcox, the young man who was the groom in tomorrow&#x2019;s big wedding, staring fixedly at the rescue that was taking place.</p><p><i>Good</i>, Suzanne thought. <i>Annie and her child have been saved</i>. But what about the folks in the first-floor County Services Bureau? Bruce Winthrop, the county agent. And his longtime secretary, Hannah Venable. What about those poor souls? Were they still inside?</p><p>Suzanne&#x2019;s question was partially answered when Winthrop, looking bug-eyed and scared spitless, suddenly crashed through the crowd. Arms flailing, he caromed off her right shoulder and then continued to push his way toward the burning building.</p><p>&#x201c;Hannah!&#x201d; Winthrop cried, frantically trying to charge through the surging crowd. &#x201c;Hannah!&#x201d; He seemed ready to rush into the burning building and save her single-handedly.</p><p>&#x201c;Whoa, whoa!&#x201d; Suzanne cried out. She dashed forward a couple of steps, snagged Winthrop&#x2019;s arm, and tried to pull him back. But the man was in such a blind panic that he simply shook her off. Suzanne made a final frantic grasp at the back of his tweed sport coat, found some purchase, and fought to reel him in backward. &#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go in there. You&#x2019;ve got to let the firemen do their jobs.&#x201d;</p><p>Winthrop spun around to look at her, but was in such an anguished state that he didn&#x2019;t display a shred of recognition. His face contorted with fear as he tried to jerk away. &#x201c;Let me go!&#x201d; he cried. Then, in a pleading tone, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to go in and get her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No you don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Suzanne told him. She grabbed Winthrop&#x2019;s arm and gave a sharp tug that made him suddenly wince. But at least she&#x2019;d commanded his attention. &#x201c;Better to alert Doogie,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll send a couple of firemen in to rescue Hannah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gotta hurry hurry hurry,&#x201d; Winthrop chattered.</p><p>Suzanne waved an arm over her head and cried out, &#x201c;Doogie! Sheriff Doogie!&#x201d;</p><p>Doogie heard his name called out above the roar of the fire and the nervous mutterings of the crowd. He swiveled his big head around, saw Suzanne, and frowned.</p><p>Suzanne pushed closer toward him, dragging Winthrop along with her. &#x201c;Hannah Venable&#x2019;s still inside,&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to send someone in to get her.&#x201d;</p><p>Doogie&#x2019;s eyes widened in surprise and he gave a sharp nod. Then, quick as a wink, he grabbed the fire chief and pulled him into a fast conversation.</p><p>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; said Suzanne. She still had a firm grip on Winthrop&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll get Hannah out. She&#x2019;ll be okay.&#x201d;</p><p>Winthrop just nodded woodenly as if in a sleepwalker&#x2019;s trance.</p><p>The firemen shot thick streams of water at the building now, trying to beat back the flames. As water gushed from fat, brown hoses that crisscrossed the street, the fire hissed with fury but seemed to slowly retreat.</p><p>&#x201c;I think they&#x2019;re gaining on the fire,&#x201d; Suzanne said to Jenny, who&#x2019;d taken up a spot in the front lines next to them.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope so,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Two firemen hastily donned protective gear&#x2014;full breathing apparatus and special asbestos coats. Then, after a hasty conference with their fire chief, they plunged into the burning building to make the daring rescue.</p><p>They were the brave ones, Suzanne thought. They were the ones who risked their lives for others. God bless and keep them.</p><p>The firemen working the hoses were definitely gaining a foothold on the fire now. Flames were knocked back as charred beams and red-hot embers sizzled and hissed.</p><p>&#x201c;Getting it under control now,&#x201d; said Darrel Fuhrman, a man Suzanne recognized as one of Kindred&#x2019;s firemen. He was tall with slicked-back dark hair and eyes that danced with wild excitement.</p><p>Suzanne wondered idly why Fuhrman wasn&#x2019;t in the fray lending a hand, as she continued to keep her eyes fixed on the front door of the building, waiting to see Hannah Venable come staggering out. Hannah was the sweet-natured clerk who had manned the front desk at the County Services Bureau for the past fifteen years. She answered phones, kept the books, and handed out brochures on how to grow snap peas, raise baby lambs, and put up fruit jams and jellies without giving your family ptomaine poisoning.</p><p>Antsy and nervous now, Suzanne moved forward. She could feel the heat from the fire practically scorching her face, like having a too-close encounter with Petra&#x2019;s industrial-strength broiler back at the Cackleberry Club. What must the firemen be feeling inside, she wondered? What must poor Hannah be going through?</p><p>Sheriff Doogie whirled around and saw Suzanne edging up to the barricade.</p><p>&#x201c;Get back!&#x201d; he yelled, waving a meaty arm. &#x201c;Everybody, get back!&#x201d;</p><p>Suzanne retreated two paces, and then, when Doogie turned around, when he wasn&#x2019;t looking anymore, she crept back to where she&#x2019;d been standing.</p><p>&#x201c;Watch out...</p></p><h2>The Adventures of Ulysses</h2><p><b>The legendary adventures of the Greek king&#x2019;s epic journey come to life in a modern retelling of <i>The Odyssey </i>that&#x2019;s &#x201c;an unmitigated delight&#x201d; (<i>School Library Journal</i>). </b><br> &nbsp;<br> In their ten-year siege of Troy, the Greeks claim victory thanks to the cunning wit of Ulysses, King of Ithaca, who devised the infamous Trojan Horse. Now, with the epic war finally finished, Ulysses sets sail for home&#x2014;but his journey will be long and arduous. Having angered Poseidon, god of the sea, Ulysses and his men are thrown off course by a raging storm and forced to wander the perilous world for another ten years.<br> &nbsp;<br> On his epic trek, Ulysses must match wits and strength with man-eating Sirens, a towering Cyclops, the witch-goddess Circe, and a slew of other deadly foes. Meanwhile, in Ithaca, his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, contend with a rowdy mob of suitors who have taken over their home in an attempt to usurp the absent ruler&#x2019;s place.</p><p>Bernard Evslin (1922&#x2013;1993) was a bestselling and award-winning author known for his works on Greek and other cultural mythologies. The <i>New York Times</i> called him &#x201c;one of the most widely published authors of classical mythology in the world.&#x201d; He was born in New Rochelle, New York, and attended Rutgers University. After several years working as a playwright, screenwriter, and documentary producer, he began publishing novels and short stories in the late 1960s. During his long career, Evslin published more than seventy books&#x2014;over thirty of which were for young adults. His bestseller <i>Heroes, Gods and Monsters of the Greek Myths</i> has been translated into ten different languages and has sold more than ten million copies worldwide. He won the National Education Association Award in 1961, and in 1986 his book <i>Hercules</i> received the Washington Irving Children&#x2019;s Book Choice Award. Evslin died in Kauai, Hawaii, at the age of seventy-seven.&nbsp;From Homer's ODYSSEY to James Joyce's classic, the ancient Greek hero and his modern counterpart have been the subject of a lot of literature. But, let's face it, most readers today run from Ulysses, fearing his tale will be ponderous and boring. So it's a wonderful surprise when narrator George Guidall lays out this straightforward, action-packed retelling with the voice of authority. To say this sailor-king has it rough as he tries to make his way home, past amorous goddesses and angry giants, is a gross understatement.

Through commentary and storytelling, author Susan Murcott traces the journey of the wives, mothers, teachers, courtesan, prostitutes, and wanderers who became leaders in the Buddhist community, roles that even today are rarely filled by women in other patriarchal religions.

To a dozen short stories spanning the American Century, the author has added a novella-length coda to his quartet of novels about Harry &#x201c;Rabbit&#x201d; Angstrom. Several strands of the Rabbit saga come together here as, during the fall and winter holidays of 1999, Harry&#x2019;s survivors fitfully entertain his memory while pursuing their own happiness up to the edge of a new millennium. Love makes Updike&#x2019;s fictional world go round&#x2014;married love, filial love, feathery licks of erotic love, and love for the domestic particulars of Middle American life.</p><p>If John Updike had never published anything but short stories--if the novels, essays, verse, and reams of occasional prose vanished into thin air--he would still be a presence to reckon with in American letters. Having said that, it's only fair to point out that his 13th collection, <i>Licks of Love</i>, is one of the master's patchier efforts. He has lost none of his notorious fluency, and even the duds are enlivened by lovely stabs of perception. But in several tales ("The Women Who Got Away," "New York Girl," "Natural Color"), Updike seems perversely bent on proving his detractors right, serving up familiar narratives of adultery and '60s-era swinging. There's no reason why lust and rage <i>shouldn't</i> dance attendance on this randy genius's old age. But he's already written about the art of extracurricular canoodling at such length that these entries are bound to seem like retreads.<p> That's the bad news. The good news is that the rest of the collection is a sheer delight. "My Father on the Verge of Disgrace" explores some fascinating Oedipal outskirts, even as the narrator's first cigarette takes on a theological accent: "It was my way of becoming a human being, and part of being human is being on the verge of disgrace." In "How Was It, Really?" Updike unveils the <i>real</i> dirty secret of old age, which is not the persistence of erotic appetite but the inevitable, appalling failure of memory. Best of all, he returns to two of his longest-running franchises, with admirable results in both cases. "His Oeuvre" revives that Semitic doppelgï¿½nger Henry Bech for one more lap around the track, and finds the author making intermittent fun of his own fancy prose style. Harry Angstrom is, needless to say, beyond hope of resurrection. But in a 182-page novella, "Rabbit Remembered," Updike brings back his survivors for a superb, surprising curtain call. The author's present-tense notation of American life (whose paradoxical epicenter is, as always, Brewer, Pennsylvania) remains as mesmerizing as ever. And despite his death, the putative hero is everywhere, as his illegitimate daughter returns to the unwilling bosom of the Angstrom clan: "A whiff of Harry, a pale glow, an unsettling drift comes off this girl, this thirty-nine-year-old piece of evidence." Wallowing in this unexpected bonus, Updike fans should steel themselves for a single pang of regret: this is likely to be the last Rabbit he will pull from his hat. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Lost Steps</h2><p>Translated into twenty languages and published in more than fourteen Spanish editions, The Lost Steps, originally published in 1953, is Alejo Carpentier&#39;s most heralded novel.

I look at the photos and imagine what I think the recipe should be. Most of the time I get it pretty close but sometimes I'm way off base. This recipe is an example of that. <br><br>The photo was of a roasted chicken on a bed of chickpeas and what I thought were tiny cubes of carrot. I could taste the dish in my head. The chickpeas were crunchy and salty next to the melting, sweet carrots and everything was suffused with chicken fat from the roasting bird. <br><br>In fact, the carrots turned out to be bits of orange bell pepper (definitely not in season in January in New York) and the chickpeas were added to the pan during the last few minutes of cooking so they would stay moist and soft, without the time to absorb much in the way of chicken essence. I'm sure it was a perfectly good dish. But I liked my own idea better.<br><br>So next time I roasted a chicken, I tried it. <br><br>I placed the chicken on a rack over the chickpeas and carrot slices so all the good juices would drip down onto them. I also added slivered lemon because I love the way lemons caramelize when you roast them, and I figured the dish would need some zip to perk up the garam masala, a spicy, earthy Indian spice blend I rubbed on the bird. <br><br>While it roasted, I chopped together a mix of parsley, lemon zest, and garlic known as gremolata (which is usually served with osso buco) to sprinkle on top. I knew it would give the whole thing some color and a little kick from the garlic, which would be welcome with all the hearty flavors.<br><br>When everything was done, the chicken was burnished, shining and fragrant, and the chickpeas, lemon bits, and carrots were caramelized and tender. It was so pretty I immediately had to take a picture, which looks nothing like the food porn photo that was its inspiration. I can't say how the flavors compare, but my chicken was darned good - intensely lemony, very succulent, the chickpeas as tempting as bacon. Maybe one day I'll dig up that other recipe to give it a whirl....though given how delightful this dish is, maybe not.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Serves 4<br><br>For the Chicken:<br>2 lemons<br>2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained<br>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>1 1/2 tablespoons garam masala<br>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br>1 (3 1/2-pound) whole chicken, rinsed and patted dry<br>4 thyme sprigs<br>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened<br>1 pound carrots, peeled, trimmed and cut into 1-inch rounds<br><br>For the Gremolata:<br>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br>1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest<br>1 small garlic clove, finely chopped<br><br>1. Preheat the oven to 400ï¿½ F. Quarter the lemons lengthwise and remove and discard any seeds. Thinly slice six of the lemon quarters crosswise (you will get little triangles) and in a bowl, toss them with the chickpeas, oil, 1/2 tablespoon (which equals 1 1/2 teaspoons if you don't have a 1/2 tablespoons measure) of the garam masala, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. <br>3. Season the inside of the chicken cavity with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Fill the cavity with remaining wedges of lemon and thyme sprigs. Rub the outside of the chicken all over with the remaining 1 tablespoon garam masala, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Rub the butter all over the skin. <br>4. Scatter the carrots in the bottom of the largest roasting pan you have (use the one you use for your Thanksgiving turkey). Place a wire roasting rack over the carrots; arrange the chicken, breast-side-up, on the rack. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast, stirring the carrots occasionally, for 30 minutes. Scatter the chickpea mixture into the bottom of the roasting pan. Continue to roast until the chicken's thigh juices run clear when pierced with a knife, 45 to 60 minutes longer. Let chicken rest 5 minutes before carving. <br>5. Meanwhile, combine the parsley, lemon zest, and garlic in a bowl. Spoon the carrot-chickpea mixture onto a platter; arrange the chicken on top. Sprinkle the gremolata over the dish and serve.<br><br>What Else?<br>- Some farmers' market chickens have tough old legs because they develop actual muscle tone from the exercise they get pecking for grubs around the farm. If you suspect you've got one like this (or you know you do from prior experience with a particular farm), you might want to carve them off the chicken carcass and give them a head start in the oven before adding the breast. That way your breast won't dry out in the time that the legs will need to soften. To do this, carve the legs off the bird and smear those legs and the rest of the chicken carcass with the butter, salt, and seasonings. Put the legs in the pan (along with the carrots) to roast for 15 minutes before adding the carcass with the breasts (tuck the lemon and herbs inside the cavity before roasting). Overall time will be a tad longer than called for above, just keep checking to see when the juices run clear with a knife.<br><br>A Dish by Another Name:<br>- For a more traditional Sunday Supper Roasted Chicken, you can skip the chickpeas and lemon bits and instead just add a pound of cubed potatoes to the pan along with the carrots. Season carrots and potatoes with salt and pepper and give them a stir once or twice while the chicken roasts. This is good with or without the gremolata.Melissa Clark, a James Beard Foundation award winner, writes about cuisine, wine, travel for numerous publications, including the <em>New York Times</em> (where she writes the enormously popular "A Good Appetite" Dining Section column), <em>Bon Appetit, Food &amp; Wine, </em> and <em>Martha Stewart</em>.

The most effective of all Erasmus's writings &#x2014; ripe with allusions, vignettes, and caricatures &#x2014; the literary gem was not only an extremely intelligent and articulate response to pretentiousness of all sorts, it also proved to be spiritual dynamite, leaving monastic brothers and clergymen the objects of universal laughter.<br>The book's purported narrator, the goddess Folly, proclaims herself to be the daughter of Youth and Wealth, nursed by Drunkenness and Ignorance. She is accompanied by such followers as Self-love, Pleasure, Flattery, and Sound Sleep.<br>A clever mix of drollery and fantasy, fast-paced and lighthearted in tone, the work has proved to be a lively and valuable commentary on modern times. It remains, according to the great Dutch historian John Huizinga, "a masterpiece of humour and wise irony ... something that no one else could have given to the world."<br></p><p></p></p><p>Erasmus wrote In Praise of Folly, his masterpiece of ironic literature, in less than a week while en route to England from Italy to visit his good friend Thomas More. He wrote it merely to amuse himself and he was astonished at its immediate and wide popularity. But his satire of the clergy, the upper classes, and general pretentiousness, narrated by the goddess Folly, daughter of Youth and Wealth, struck a chord and is considered by some historians to be one of the catalysts of the Protestant Reformation. <p>This might have disappointed Erasmus who, though critical of the Church, never intended to encourage a split and remained a faithful adherent until his death. Still read regularly in college English courses, Erasmus's timeless classic remains as relevant today as it was when first written nearly five hundred years ago.</p>Desiderius Erasmus (1466&#x2013;1536) was a Dutch Renaissance humanist and a Catholic priest and theologian. Erasmus was a classical scholar who wrote in a "pure" Latin style and enjoyed the sobriquet "Prince of the Humanists." He has been called "the crowning glory of the Christian humanists." Using humanist techniques for working on texts, he prepared important new Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament. These raised questions that would be influential in the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation. He also wrote The Praise of Folly, Handbook of a Christian Knight, On Civility in Children, Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style, Julius Exclusus, and many other works. Erasmus lived through the Reformation period and he consistently criticized some contemporary popular Christian beliefs. In relation to clerical abuses in the Church, Erasmus remained committed to reforming the Church from within. He also held to Catholic doctrines such as that of free will, which some Protestant Reformers rejected in favor of the doctrine of predestination. His middle road approach disappointed and even angered many Protestants, such as Martin Luther, as well as conservative Catholics. He died in Basel in 1536 and was buried in the formerly Catholic cathedral there, recently converted to a Reformed church.</p><h2>City of Lifestone (Warhammer Adventures: Realm Quest)</h2><p>Epic heroes, mighty armies and terrifying monsters clash against the backdrop of magical landscapes.<br><br>Raised as a slave in the Darkoath camps of Aqshy, Kiri dreams of a better life.

But his real expertise was &#x201c;reading&#x201d; body language. He possessed an uncanny ability to glean the thoughts of those he interrogated.<br> <br>So it was that, on a routine assignment to interview a &#x201c;person of interest&#x201d;&#x2014;a former American soldier named Rod Ramsay&#x2014;Navarro noticed his interviewee&#x2019;s hand trembling slightly when he was asked about another soldier who had recently been arrested in Germany on suspicion of espionage. That thin lead was enough for the FBI agent to insist to his bosses that an investigation be opened.<br> <br>What followed is unique in the annals of espionage detection&#x2014;a two-year-long battle of wits. The dueling antagonists: an FBI agent who couldn&#x2019;t overtly tip to his target that he suspected him of wrongdoing lest he clam up, and a traitor whose weakness was the enjoyment he derived from sparring with his inquisitor. Navarro&#x2019;s job was made even more difficult by his adversary&#x2019;s brilliance: not only did Ramsay possess an authentic photographic memory as well as the second highest IQ ever recorded by the US Army, he was bored by people who couldn&#x2019;t match his erudition. To ensure that the information flow would continue, Navarro had to pre-choreograph every interview, becoming a chess master plotting twenty moves in advance.<br> <br>And the backdrop to this mental tug of war was the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the very real possibility that its leaders, in a last bid to alter the course of history, might launch a devastating attack. If they did, they would have Ramsay to thank, because as Navarro would learn over the course of forty-two mind-bending interviews, Ramsay had, by his stunning intelligence giveaways, handed the Soviets the ability to utterly destroy the US.<br> <br>The story of a determined hero who pushed himself to jaw-dropping levels of exhaustion and who rallied his team to expose undreamed of vulnerabilities in America&#x2019;s defense, <i>Three Minutes to Doomsday </i>will leave the reader with disturbing thoughts of the risks the country takes even today with its most protected national secrets.</p><p>For twenty-five years Joe Navarro was a Special Agent with the FBI in the area of counterintelligence, and he was a founding member of the FBI&#x2019;s elite National Security Division Behavioral Analysis Program, which focused on the behavior of spies, terrorists, and criminal behavior.

My recruiter told me back when I joined up that I was the second youngest person ever offered a position with the Bureau. I don&#x2019;t know about that, but strangely enough&#x2014;since I can never play football competitively again&#x2014;the sport is what landed me on the FBI radar screen, at least in a roundabout way.<br> <br>While I lay in that hospital in Miami, watching my senior high-school year drift away, thirty-one of my thirty-two athletic scholarship offers disappeared. A single one survived, from Brigham Young University. LaVell Edwards, BYU&#x2019;s coach, called one afternoon to say that he still liked me, that I was big and fast. Why not give it a try? I did just that, for three days, by which time the arm I&#x2019;d nearly lost a few months earlier was swollen to three times normal size and the docs were talking blood clots and possible nerve damage.<br> <br>That was the official dead end of my dreams of gridiron glory, but I stayed on at BYU, supporting myself with a mix of scholarship money, loans, and odd jobs, including one as a campus policeman, at the suggestion of my criminology professor. And thus when the NSA, the CIA, and the FBI came recruiting at BYU, as they always do in abundance at Mormon-dominated schools, my background seemed particularly apt: campus cop, graduate of the Utah Police Academy, a devout anti-Communist in general and a Cuban ï¿½migrï¿½ stridently opposed to Fidel Castro in particular, and ardently in love with America. Maybe I really was the second-youngest recruit. What better combination of traits could the Bureau have been looking for?<br> <br>As for me, I was so desperate for paying work that I said yes on the spot, really without giving it another thought.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>ONE THING I SOON learned: There are no normal hours in the FBI. Contractually, I work ten and a half hours per day, but I&#x2019;m constantly being asked to do more and more with less and less. It&#x2019;s not just my own cases that eat away time. There&#x2019;s always some new shortage, always &#x201c;the needs of the Bureau&#x201d;&#x2014;a term that pecks at me every time I think I&#x2019;m going to have a weekend off and instead have to cancel family time once again.<br> <br>While I&#x2019;m stationed in Puerto Rico, they need SWAT operators to work on terrorism cases, so I get volunteered by my supervisor&#x2014;&#x201c;volunteered&#x201d; as in one day I see my name on a list to attend Basic-SWAT for four weeks and that&#x2019;s that. Not that I mind all that much. The training is fun, and really, who doesn&#x2019;t want to have an MP-5 Heckler &amp; Koch suppressed submachine gun in the trunk of his car? But suddenly, every few weeks, on top of my regular work, there are the SWAT operations, and some of those last days. They can involve anything from an airplane hijacking to a takedown of the Machetero terrorist group (macheteros means &#x201c;machete wielders,&#x201d; but these guys were good with guns, rifles, and bombs, too).<br> <br>But what really eats up my spare time is the flying. In researching my background, the Bureau learns that I received my pilot&#x2019;s license in high school. Once I come on board, it isn&#x2019;t long before I start getting calls to help with aerial surveillance. Do I complain? Not really. Going from the bare-bones Cessna 150 I&#x2019;d trained in to a Cessna 182 with retractable gears and air-conditioning is a huge step up, and this time I&#x2019;m being paid to fly, not the other way around. But the hours are killers. Often, I work a regular shift, then pilot 6 p.m. till midnight&#x2014;a great time to fly because the air is generally calm at night&#x2014;but add it all together and I&#x2019;m putting in way too many sixteen-hour days. When my family does see me, I&#x2019;m so tired I sometimes doze off standing on my feet in line at the supermarket.<br> <br>Ultimately, the flying and the SWAT operations take a mental backseat to what I really enjoy&#x2014;counterintelligence work or &#x201c;CI.&#x201d; The thing about CI work is that it connects you to the world. It makes you pay attention to what&#x2019;s happening in faraway places. Any country can tolerate bank robberies, carjackings, rapes, even riots, but espionage is the only crime a nation can potentially not survive. With the right kind of intelligence, you can render another nation inert or change the course of history. That&#x2019;s why I love CI&#x2014;because it really matters.<br> <br>I start just about every work morning with the daily intelligence brief that comes clacking in over our teletype machine a little after sunrise. Today&#x2019;s no different. Last night I was up almost to midnight, flying lazy circles over Tampa Bay, helping out another squad short on surveillance agents. This morning, I&#x2019;m touring the world&#x2019;s hot spots, searching for anything in the overnight synopsis that might find its way back to Central Florida.<br> <br>Example: Police in Lima, Peru, yesterday raided the plant that prints the newspaper El Diario, thought to be the voice of the Maoist guerilla group Sendero Luminoso, aka Shining Path. Sounds like a stretch, I admit, but when Maoist guerillas in South America get upset, I take notice because Cuba&#x2019;s Americas Department funds extremism in the region, and the Marxist ex-guerilla in Havana can sometimes get a little itchy himself.<br> <br>Some things I can pretty much take a pass on. I&#x2019;m sorry that hundreds died and thousands were injured in an earthquake that rocked northern India and Nepal, but there&#x2019;s not much I can do about plate tectonics that far away. The state of national emergency just declared in Pakistan is another matter. A few days ago President Zia and ten of his top generals disappeared in a midair explosion. Now Zia&#x2019;s successor, Ishaq Khan, is telling reporters that &#x201c;the enemy has penetrated the inner defense of the country.&#x201d; Does &#x201c;enemy&#x201d; mean India? Probably, but unrest on or near the Subcontinent can easily spill over borders, and Tampa has been home since 1983 to the United States Central Command, whose responsibilities include Central Asia. Part of my job is to watch CentCom&#x2019;s back. The Pakistan-India conflict is also a proxy tug-of-war between China and the USSR&#x2014;this could get ugly overnight.<br> <br>As always, the Middle East is thick with violence and intrigue. In Haifa, a hand grenade tossed into a crowded sidewalk cafï¿½ has wounded twenty-five, including seven members of a single family that had been admiring the window display at a toy store.<br> <br>Another dog-bites-man story: The IRA has struck again in Northern Ireland&#x2014;eight dead and twenty-eight wounded this time when a bomb explodes aboard a civilian bus carrying British soldiers. The bomb, which the IRA said was fashioned from two hundred pounds of Czech-made Semtex, left a crater six feet deep. This story is also less distant than you might think. We have IRA financial supporters in Tampa who probably woke up cheering this very morning.<br> <br>Counterintelligence is inevitably biased toward the biggest gorilla in the room, and that&#x2019;s the Soviet Union. They have the most spies, the most money, and they get most of my attention, but the Warsaw Pact countries are nothing to snicker at. East Germany is far smaller than the USSR, but its intelligence service, run by the legendary Markus Wolf, is even tougher to crack than the KGB. Not just tougher. Better&#x2014;in a very scary way.<br> <br>In Poland, I read, seventy-five thousand coal miners are out on strike, demanding that Solidarity, the outlawed trade union, be legalized. Moscow can&#x2019;t be happy with this. The KGB would love nothing better than to get rid of Pope John Paul II and his influence over his fellow Poles. In fact, the Soviets via the Bulgarians have already made one assassination attempt. Now Moscow is witnessing what it sought to erase: influence over power. The Pope is making the KGB quake. Yet another hot spot: In Czechoslovakia, source of the Semtex that blew the British police to smithereens in Northern Ireland, a small group gathered two days ago in Prague&#x2019;s Wenceslas Square to sing the Czech national anthem on the twentieth anniversary of the day two hundred thousand Warsaw Pact troops and five thousand tanks rolled into the country to crush the so-called Prague Spring.<br> <br>By itself, none of this Soviet stuff is particularly alarming: Even seventy-five thousand angry miners pose no serious threat to the world&#x2019;s Other Superpower&#x2014;the USSR has crushed the yearning of people to be free before and they&#x2019;ll do it again. But put it all together, and something is happening. Courage is breaking out behind the Iron Curtain, or maybe just the multiple failures of the Soviet system at all levels&#x2014;economic, political, moral&#x2014;are finally becoming impossible to ignore and cover up.<br> <br>Either way, it might be a little early to start celebrating the Soviets&#x2019; decline. The KGB has both the power to quash and suppress, and the incentive. I remember talking to a Soviet KGB defector once. &#x201c;We can never afford to let go,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve all seen how the crowds hung Mussolini&#x2019;s body when his government fell. That&#x2019;s what will happen to us, especially in Eastern Europe&#x2014;they hate us there.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;m thinking there&#x2019;s nothing more dangerous than a wounded Russian bear when Jay Koerner, my supervisor, approaches my desk. The time is 7:57 a.m. The date: Tuesday, August 23, 1988, and while I have no way of knowing, the next decade of my life has just been spoken for.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yours,&#x201d; he says, handing me a teletype from FBIHQ. &#x201c;Now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mine?&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve got a full day ahead of me and am scheduled to help out with surveillance tonight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lynn&#x2019;s out of town. The army intel guy will be here in half an hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jay is halfway back to his office by the time I look down at the teletype. I like Jay. He never gets in the way, but he&#x2019;s not a conversationalist. The message is from the National Security Division, and in typical Bureau style it reads:<br> <br>Anytime after 0400 hrs Zulu 8/23/88, you are to locate and interview Roderick James RAMSAY, last known to be living in Tampa, Florida, regarding his knowledge of or association with Clyde Lee CONRAD while stationed at 8th ID, Bad Kreuznach, West Germany: service years 1983&#x2013;85. INSCOM [Army Intelligence] will liaise and assist: locate, interview, report.<br> <br>In criminal investigations, information is power, which means that the document I&#x2019;m holding is the equivalent of a five-watt bulb, barely enough to light a glove compartment. Still, I&#x2019;m intrigued. The very fact that INSCOM&#x2014;the US Army Intelligence Security Command&#x2014;is involved means there&#x2019;s probably more at stake here than selling PX cigarette coupons on the black market. By the time my army CI counterpart walks in the door, I&#x2019;m actually anxious to talk with him.<br> <br>Al Eways, the INSCOM liaison, turns out to be a nice guy, but time is short, and his obligations are many. Roderick James Ramsay, our interviewee, is but one of multiple interviews on his overstuffed calendar.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get going&#x201d; are not quite his first words to me, but close enough. To emphasize the point, Al hands me an address and adds, &#x201c;We think this is where he is.&#x201d; A minute and a half later, I&#x2019;m behind the wheel of my Bu-Steed&#x2014;agent-speak for our drab government-issue sedans. Al, at the other end of the front seat, has his nose buried in notes, presumably a backgrounder on Ramsay, but I&#x2019;m only guessing. I drive, he reads. It&#x2019;s not my place to pry.<br> <br>CI operates on a strict need-to-know basis. Al is free to fill me in on the details, but the protocol is very straightforward: Unless he tenders the information to me, I&#x2019;m going to be in the dark until he starts interviewing the subject. Sounds a little counterintuitive, I know, but observing carefully and learning on the go is sometimes the best way.<br> <br>The first challenge is to find the address I&#x2019;ve been handed. I know the general area&#x2014;a sprawling enclave of single-wide trailers northwest of the Tampa airport, in an area once known for its oranges. A month or two back I flew surveillance over this same patch of ground, following a low-level drug dealer. We&#x2019;ll find the place, I know that, so I start thinking safety.<br> <br>Where am I? Where&#x2019;s the closest hospital? Who&#x2019;s in the area? Young people or old? Mothers pushing strollers or out-of-work males standing on street corners? Are there teenagers roaming the streets?<br> <br>As I look for the address, I&#x2019;m also thinking of where to park. I want the driver&#x2019;s side away from the residence so if I need to, I can use the engine block for cover and have the advantage of distance. We&#x2019;re near now, but I circle a few more times to get the lay of the land in case I need to get away in a hurry or have to call for help.<br> <br>And then there&#x2019;s the real purpose of all this: the interview itself. What are we going to talk about? How will we get this Ramsay guy to relax? People tell you a lot more when they feel in their comfort zone than when you have them sweating on the rack. One more thing: At the end of the day, I&#x2019;m responsible for more than our safety. I&#x2019;m on the hook for this interview, too. Ramsay is a civilian, and INSCOM technically has no jurisdiction over a civilian. Still, I have to give Al leeway because he&#x2019;s holding the cards; he knows more than I do. If anything goes wrong, though, it&#x2019;s going to be my ass on the line.<br> <br>Al and I are silent as we drive past a well-kept single-wide trailer with a dark-green latticework skirt. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the place,&#x201d; Al says a little quizzically as I glide past and circle the neighborhood one more time.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; I reply. &#x201c;Just making sure I know the territory.&#x201d;<br> <br>Al is paying attention now, too, and I appreciate that. A lot of counterintelligence involves running down blind alleys, but we&#x2019;ve got a saying in the FBI: There&#x2019;s no such thing as a routine interview or stop. Take it too casually, and it might be the last one you ever do.<br> <br>One time, I was helping the local sheriff&#x2019;s office in Yuma, Arizona, with an arrest when the guy we were looking for stuck a gun out his front door and blasted away. One round grazed the head of the deputy I was standing inches away from. A year later, still in Yuma, I was on the phone arranging a basketball game with a couple of FBI agents in the El Centro, California, office, sixty miles west, while they waited for an interviewee who&#x2019;d promised to stop by to see them. He did, also with gun blazing, while I was still on the line. One of the agents was alive, writhing in his own blood, when I got there. He died moments later. The shooter was lying there, too, dead by his own hand. These things stay with you forever, like the smell of a dead body&#x2014;something you never forget.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>THIS TIME, AT LEAST, the drama is minimal. Turns out, no one is home when we knock on the trailer door. All this driving around has accomplished nothing except to alert local residents that strangers are on their turf. One of the locals steps forward and asks if we need help. We tell him we&#x2019;re looking for Rod Ramsay.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is his mother&#x2019;s place,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Rod&#x2019;s house-sitting a little ways over.&#x201d;<br> <br>Al and I look so much like law enforcement that the guy doesn&#x2019;t even bother asking why we&#x2019;re here, but he does helpfully provide us with an address and points with his chin in the general direction we&#x2019;re to follow, and the new neighborhood, in fact, is no more than two minutes away&#x2014;small tract homes built back in the early sixties. Now it&#x2019;s twenty-five years later, and their best days are long behind them. After I find the right house, park, and lock the Bu-Steed&#x2019;s ...</p><h2>Confronting Injustice and Oppression: Concepts and Strategies for Social Workers (Foundations of Social Work Knowledge Series)</h2><p>More urgent than ever, David G. Gil&#39;s guiding text gives social workers the knowledge and confidence they need to change unjust realities. Clarifying the meaning, sources, and dynamics of injustice, exploitation, and oppression and certifying the place of the social worker in combating these conditions, Gil promotes social-change strategies rooted in the nonviolent philosophies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.. He shares suggestions for transition policies intended to alleviate poverty, unemployment, and discrimination and examines modes of radical social work practice compatible with the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and President Roosevelt&#39;s proposed &#34;Economic Bill of Rights.&#34; For this updated edition, Gil considers the factors driving two crucial developments since his volume&#39;s initial publication: the Middle East&#39;s Arab Spring and the U.S. Occupy Wall Street movement.</p><p>Gil sounds the call to embrace the core values of radical social work: equality, liberty, cooperation, and affirmation of community in pursuit of individual and social development.David G.

This network of exchange emerged along the borders between agricultural China and the steppe nomads during the Han Dynasty (206BCE-220CE), in consequence of the inter-dependence and the conflicts of these two distinctive societies. In their quest for horses, fragrances, spices, gems, glassware, and other exotics from the lands to their west, the Han Empire extended its dominion over the oases around the Takla Makan Desert and sent silk all the way to the Mediterranean, either through the land routes leading to the caravan city of Palmyra in Syria desert, or by way of northwest India, the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea, landing at Alexandria. The Silk Road survived the turmoil of the demise of the Han and Roman Empires, reached its golden age during the early middle age, when the Byzantine Empire and the Tang Empire became centers of silk culture and established the models for high culture of the Eurasian world. The coming of Islam extended silk culture to an even larger area and paved the way for an expanded market for textiles and other commodities. By the 11th century, however, the Silk Road was in decline because of intense competition from the sea routes of the Indian Ocean.<br><br>Using supply and demand as the framework for analyzing the formation and development of the Silk Road, the book examines the dynamics of the interactions of the nomadic pastoralists with sedentary agriculturalists, and the spread of new ideas, religions, and values into the world of commerce, thus illustrating the cultural forces underlying material transactions. This effort at tracing the interconnections of the diverse participants in the transcontinental Silk Road exchange will demonstrate that the world had been linked through economic and ideological forces long before the modern era.<br></p><p><br><strong>Xinru Liu </strong>teaches in the Department of History at The College of New Jersey and was formerly Senior Researcher at the Institute of World History, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.<br><br>"A welcome addition to the New Oxford World History series...Any general reader interested in silk or textiles will enjoy this book, but so too will one who is captivated by any other aspect of the Silk Road, for it provides a quick but fascinating historical narrative.

Their archaeological record is both substantial and fascinating, including tomb paintings, sculpture, jewelry, and art. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Christopher Smith explores Etruscan history, culture, language, and customs. Examining the controversial debates about their origins, he explores how they once lived, placing them within the geographical, economic, and political context of the time. Smith concludes by demonstrating how the Etruscans have been studied and perceived throughout the ages, and the impact this has had on our understanding of their place in history.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford's <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

Of particular benefit to students and practicing clinicians alike are the useful and practical case examples that illustrate the key concepts presented in each chapter."--Lynn Friss Feinberg, MSW, National Center on Caregiving, Family Caregiver Alliance&nbsp;"Liberally illustrated with case examples, this book artfully blends clinical expertise and research findings to provide sound guidance and proven approaches to assessment and intervention. It is no short order to write a book that appeals to students, to experienced practitioners seeking to build their skills for working with older adults, and to researchers seeking a broad foundation in clinical concepts, but Zarit and Zarit have successfully achieved that goal. I found the chapters on assessment to be particularly well done.

Each edition has considerably advanced the Contextual Model of Family Stress. </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With groundbreaking work as scientist-practitioner, Dr. Boss is the principal theorist in the study of family stress from ambiguous loss, a term she coined. Since then, she has researched various types of ambiguous loss, summarizing her work in the widely acclaimed book, <i>Ambiguous Loss: Learning to Live with Unresolved Grief </i>(Harvard University Press, 1999). In addition, <i>Loss, Trauma, and Resilience</i> (Norton, 2006), presents six therapeutic guidelines for treatment when loss is complicated by ambiguity. These guidelines are based on her years of work with families of the physically missing during the Vietnam War, after 9/11, and in Kosovo, as well as in clinical work as a family therapist. For families, Dr. Boss wrote the book, <i>Loving Someone Who Has Dementia</i> (Jossey-Bass, 2011), which outlines strategies for managing the ongoing stress and grief while caring for someone who is both here and not here, physically present but psychologically absent.

Even a new life in the body of a beautiful young woman.</p><p><b>Robert Anson Heinlein</b> was born in Missouri in 1907, and was raised there. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1929, but was forced by illness to retire from the Navy in 1934. He settled in California and over the next five years held a variety of jobs while doing post-graduate work in mathematics and physics at the University of California. In 1939 he sold his first science fiction story to <i>Astounding</i> magazine and soon devoted himself to the genre.<p>He was a four-time winner of the Hugo Award for his novels <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> (1961), <i>Starship Troopers</i> (1959), <i>Double Star</i> (1956), and <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> (1966).

The author completes the Buddhist historical record by discussing women, usually absent from histories of Buddhism, and she provides the first feminist analysis of the major concepts found in Buddhist religion. Gross demonstrates that the core teachings of Buddhism promote gender equity rather than male dominance, despite the often sexist practices found in Buddhist institutions throughout history.</p><p><p>Rita M. Gross is Professor of Comparative Studies in Religion at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire. A former president of the Society for Buddhist-Christian Studies, she is the editor of Beyond Androcentrism: New Essays on Women and Religion, and with Nancy Falk, of Unspoken Worlds: Women&#x2019;s Religious Lives. She is also the author of numerous articles and essays on women and religion.</p>&#x201c;I cannot say enough in praise of this book. It is well balanced, balancing creative insightful thinking with solid scholarship, and it is fascinating&#x2015;a real page-turner. (I&#x2019;m not kidding!)&#x201d; &#x2015; Grace G. Burford<br><br>&#x201c;The power of this book comes from the combination of the passion and analytic skill that Gross brings to this feminist reconstruction of the Buddhist tradition. It is a book that should inform all introductory classes on Buddhism. Through a reexamination of basic texts, Gross describes women&#x2019;s experiences in different cultures and epochs, and shows their relevance for the Buddha&#x2019;s Path to Enlightenment as well as for the social roles and images of women in different times and places.&#x201d; &#x2015; Frederick J. Streng, Southern Methodist University<br><br>&#x201c;Gross has written the magnum opus of feminist critique and revisioning of Buddhism. This has great theoretical and practical significance for feminist theology in its global inter-faith dialogue. The particular merit of this book is its bridging of high quality scholarship and accessibility to the non-expert.&#x201d; &#x2015; Rosemary Radford Ruether, Garrett Theological Seminary and Northwestern University<br><br>&#x201c;The book will fill a real, indeed urgent, need and be of great service to many Buddhists and students, scholars and friends of Buddhism. Here are some of its many strengths: It clearly harvests years of impassioned study and experience, offers refreshingly bold, original and well-reasoned arguments, and deals with important questions that only a woman who is both a scholar and practitioner would adequately recognize. It appropriately combines both textual work and historical/anthropological perspectives, along with a clearly delineated feminist theoretical stance. It offers a valuable overview of the roles of women and discerning comparisons between them. The feminist analysis of key Buddhist concepts is excellent, especially issues of gender in relation to selflessness, emotions, nonduality. These burning issues for many Western women meeting Buddhism receive here very thoughtful, thorough, original treatment. The &#x2018;prophetic voice&#x2019; that Gross openly brings to the Buddhist tradition is welcome, moving and appropriate.&#x201d; &#x2015; Joanna R.

He flies us back to the south of France (a region some readers of his irresistible best-sellers believe him to have invented), on a wild chase through galleries, homes of prominent collectors, and wickedly delectable restaurants. There are stopovers in the Bahamas and England, and in New York, where that glossiest of magazines, Decorating Quarterly, reflects the cutting-edge trendiness of its editor, Camilla Jameson Porter. (Camilla has recently broken new ground in the world of power lunches by booking two tables on the same day, and shuttling between them, at the city's trendiest restaurant.)<br><br>It is Camilla who has sent our hero, Andre Kelly, to Cap Ferrat to take glamorous photo-graphs of the houses and treasures of the rich, famous, and fatuous. He happens to have his camera at the ready when he spots a Cï¿½zanne being loaded onto a plumber's truck near the home of an absent collector. Odd, thinks Andre. And in no time he's on the trail of a state-of-the-art art scam, chasing Cï¿½zanne.<br><br>It's a joy to follow him and the crowds intent on speeding or foiling his quest--including a beautiful agent; a super-savvy art dealer attracted to the finer things in life, especially if they promise the payoff of a lifetime; an awesome Dutch forger; some outstandingly greedy New York sophisticates; and, invisible in the background, the parade of remarkable chefs whose mouthwatering culinary masterpieces periodically soothe the hero and tantalize the reader of Chasing Cï¿½zanne.</p><p>Our hero, glamorous art photographer Andre Kelly, is on assignment for glamorous <i>DQ Magazine</i>--run by the glamorous Camilla Porter--in Cape Ferrat on the (you guessed it) glamorous Cï¿½te d'Azur. Snooping around an ancestral pile for some snaps, by chance he spies Old Claude, the ancient retainer of the immensely wealthy Denoyer family, packing the family Cezanne into a plumbing van. Puzzled, Andre investigates, and the game is afoot. Peter Mayle's latest effort, <i>Chasing Cezanne</i>, is a whodunit that shows good manners and impeccable taste. It takes its characters--graduates of all the best schools, of course--to some of the world's most posh locales. The plot device is high rent, too: a purloined painting worth a cool $30 million. To call this book lightweight seems unfair and boorish besides. There's lots of travel, lots of opulence, lots of opportunities for Mayle to describe Paris and Provence, and all the yummies you'll find in both places. Who can worry about a mystery when the food's so delectable?"A delightful blend of crime and cuisine." --San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>"Easygoing wit and dead-on satire. . . . Mayle is becoming an American Evelyn Waugh. . . . He virtually establishes a lip-licking new literary genre--call it dinnerotica." --People<br><br>"As light as a successful soufflï¿½. . . . Charm abounds." --Boston Globe</p><h2>The Bertie Project: 44 Scotland Street Series (11)</h2><p><b>Our beloved cast of characters are back, as are the joys and trials of life at 44 Scotland Street in this latest installment of Alexander McCall Smith&#x2019;s delightfully charming series. </b><br> &nbsp;<br> Bertie&#x2019;s mother, Irene, returns from the Middle East to discover that, in her absence, her son has been exposed to the worst of evils&#x2014;television shows, ice cream parlors, and even unsanctioned art at the National Portrait Gallery. Her wrath descends on Bertie&#x2019;s long-suffering father, Stuart. But Stuart has found a reason to spend more time outside of the house and seems to have a new spring in his step. What does this mean for the residents of 44 Scotland Street? <br> The winds of change have come to the others as well. Angus undergoes a spiritual transformation after falling victim to an unexpected defenestration. Bruce has fallen in a rather different sense for a young woman who is determined to share with him her enthusiasm for extreme sports. Matthew and Elspeth have a falling out with their triplets&#x2019; au pair, while Big Lou continues to fall in love with her new role as a mother. And as Irene resumes work on what she calls her Bertie Project, reinstating Bertie&#x2019;s Italian lessons, yoga classes, and psychotherapy, Bertie begins to hatch a project of his own&#x2014;one that promises freedom.</p><p>Alexander McCall Smith is the author of the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency series, the Isabel Dalhousie series, the 44 Scotland Street series, the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series, and the Corduroy Mansions series. He is professor emeritus of medical law at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and has served with many national and international organizations concerned with bioethics.Beer and Knees<br><br>On any Friday evening, the Cumberland Bar, just round the corner from Drummond Place and Scotland Street, might be expected to be busy, the meeting place of assorted mercantile tribes, of office workers from further down the hill, of young accountants, of estate agents and lawyers, and, conspicuous by their less formal attire, of some of the more bohemian, the more artistic inhabitants of this eastern corner of Edinburgh&#x2019;s Georgian New Town. At least two of this last group were present early that evening&#x2014;Angus Lordie, portrait painter and owner of the dog, Cyril, and his friend, Matthew, proprietor of a small art gallery on Dundas Street, husband of Elspeth, and father of the robust and increasingly rumbustious triplets, Tobermory, Rognvald, and Fergus. Cyril, the only dog in Scotland to have a gold tooth, and the only dog anywhere to have been trained to lift his leg at the mention of the controversial conceptual art award, the Turner Prize, was also there, lying contentedly beneath the table at which Matthew and Angus sat. Underneath this table was to be seen an empty metal bowl, licked clean of the dark stout poured into it only ten minutes earlier, and the consumption of which had induced Cyril&#x2019;s state of somnolent contentment.<br><br>&#x201c;Your dog,&#x201d; observed Matthew, &#x201c;really is a most peculiar creature. I&#x2019;ve never quite worked him out, you know. He keeps looking at me in a distinctly disconcerting way.&#x201d;<br><br>Angus glanced down at Cyril. Although one of the dog&#x2019;s eyes was closed, he saw that the other, half-open, was focused on Matthew&#x2019;s feet.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s as if he had something against me,&#x201d; Matthew continued. &#x201c;Some canine grudge perhaps.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t think Cyril dislikes you. Quite the opposite, in fact.&#x201d; Angus smiled at Matthew. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that he&#x2019;s always had this thing about your ankles.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He nipped me,&#x201d; said Matthew accusingly. &#x201c;Remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. That was when he couldn&#x2019;t control himself any further. He yielded to temptation.&#x201d; Angus paused, ready to defend his dog. &#x201c;We all have our temptations, don&#x2019;t we? Some hidden desire, something we&#x2019;re perhaps a bit ashamed of. Nobody&#x2019;s immune to that.&#x201d; He paused again, before concluding, &#x201c;Chocolate . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew stared at Angus. He blushed. He had yielded to temptation only that afternoon, eating an entire bar of expensive Belgian chocolate bought by his assistant, Pat, as a birthday present for Elspeth. The chocolate had been entrusted to him, beautifully wrapped, for delivery to Elspeth, and he had sat and gazed at it, struggling with temptation, until at last he had succumbed. He had then eaten it in a single sitting when Pat went to post some letters, afterwards concealing the wrapping in the drawer of his desk. He had told himself that he would replace it in good time and that Elspeth would never know. But it was, he later decided, an entirely shameful thing to do&#x2014;no different from the act of a postman who steals a parcel, or a charity collector who pockets donations. Was it possible that Angus had guessed what he had done? That seemed so unlikely, and yet why else would he suddenly bring chocolate into the conversation?<br><br>He dismissed his scruples; it was hardly anything to get into a fankle over, hardly an issue at all . . . chocolate was a fungible, after all; something that could be replaced by more of the same. A fankle&#x2014;the Scots word seemed just right for its purpose, as so many Scots words did; a fankle was a mess, a state of confusion, sometimes leading to a stramash&#x2014;another useful Scots word&#x2014;and it was something one sought to avoid if at all possible.<br><br>Angus raised his glass to his lips. Having broached the topic of temptation, he was keen to abandon the subject. He himself experienced the occasional temptation&#x2014;nothing serious, of course, and barely anti-social&#x2014;but he was not sure that he would actually own up to such thoughts. Better, though, to think about something else altogether, which was, of course, a recommended way of tackling temptation in the first place.<br><br>But it was Matthew who moved the conversation on. &#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Be that as it may, have you seen the plans for that new building?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus had, and sighed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think . . .&#x201d; he began, and then stopped. There was not much one could add, he felt, to the charges of gross Philistinism that had already been levelled at the developers.<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; said Matthew, &#x201c;you&#x2019;d think, wouldn&#x2019;t you? Howï¿½ever, I just don&#x2019;t have the energy to protest. I know I should; I know we should all rise up as one and flood the council with objections, but do they care? Does anyone actually imagine they give any weight to the likes of us, Angus? Les citoyens?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus thought for a moment, and then answered, &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So perhaps we should just give the matter a Gallic shrug . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Angus looked puzzled. &#x201c;A Gallic shrug?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The French are always shrugging,&#x201d; explained Matthew. &#x201c;You ask their view on things and they give a sort of insouciant shrug, as if to say that these things happen and they, at least, are completely unsurprised.&#x201d;<br><br>Angus knew what Matthew meant. He remembered a visit that he and Domenica had been paid by a French anthropologist a few months previously. The topic of French politics had cropped up in the conversation&#x2014;there was a long and crippling strike in France, with the government digging in against virtually everybody&#x2014;and the French visitor had simply shrugged. Pouf! he had said, adding, for clarification, Bif!<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps a shrug is not such a bad response,&#x201d; Angus said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the alternative? Getting all steamed up? Hot under the collar? You end up being angry&#x2014;outraged even&#x2014;but does that actually do any good?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew himself was about to shrug, but stopped in time. One could not pronounce on shrugs with a shrug. &#x201c;I suppose that a shrug indicates acceptance,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Which is what we should all cultivate,&#x201d; added Angus. &#x201c;Those who accept things are calmer, more resolved . . . and, I imagine, live much longer than those who rail against them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; said Matthew.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t abide moaning,&#x201d; said Angus, taking a sip of his beer. &#x201c;Moaning gets us nowhere. It confirms the moaner in his state of discontent, and it irritates those who have to listen to the complaints.&#x201d; He paused, and looked enquiringly at Matthew. &#x201c;Have I told you about my knee?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Matthew shook his head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re having knee trouble?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A bit,&#x201d; said Angus. He looked at his beer glass, half full, with an expression of regret. &#x201c;I can only have one beer; you know&#x2014;because of my knee.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew frowned. &#x201c;Because of your knee?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus told him. &#x201c;You see what happened,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;is this . . .&#x201d;<br><br>*<br><br>News of Bruce<br><br>&#x201c;I first noticed it,&#x201d; said Angus, &#x201c;when I was driving up to St. Fillans. We have friends there, you see. Actually, she&#x2019;s some sort of cousin of Domenica&#x2019;s, and he used to manage a branch of the Bank of Scotland in the days when banks had proper managers in their branches&#x2014;somebody you could actually speak to.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Remember our wonderful, solid, Presbyterian banks, Angus?&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Who wrecked our banks? Who actually did it? And I don&#x2019;t mean who lost the money by gambling on toxic mortgages and things like that, but who actually decreed that we shouldn&#x2019;t be able to speak to anybody if we phoned the branch? Or who said that banks needn&#x2019;t answer letters their customers wrote to them? Who ended the idea that banks actually supported people through rough times? Who ended all that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;People down in the City of London,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Avariï¿½cious, arrogant people. I have a list of them somewhere. I cut it out of the newspaper. But, as I was saying . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course&#x2014;as you were saying.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were driving up to St. Fillans, going by way of Comrie. You know that back road that goes from Braco&#x2014;up over the hills?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew thought for a second before he remembered. As a sixteen-year-old boy he had gone to cadet camp during the summer and they had been driven in an ancient green army truck along that winding road, half looking forward to, half dreading the experience ahead: the tepid, frequently cold, showers, the rough camaraderie of the Nissen huts, the bullying (both subtle and unsubtle), the shouting and the crudity of males living in close proximity to one another for a week or more. &#x201c;Past Cultybraggan Camp?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Almost,&#x201d; said Angus. And he, too, remembered what that had been like in his own day. For a moment there was an additional bond between them, a bond that surpassed the ordinary ties of friendship, a bond based on a shared tribal experience. He continued, &#x201c;It was on that road, just as it begins to drop down sharply towards Comrie&#x2014;that&#x2019;s when I felt this pain in my knee. I thought I&#x2019;d pulled something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You often don&#x2019;t notice it when you actually pull the muscle,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;Then later on the pain starts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was quite intense,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;It was a sharp, insistent pain. Quite bad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it got steadily worse after we got to St. Fillans. That night I found it difficult to bend my knee at all. It was hard to get into bed&#x2014;I had to sit on the edge of the mattress and then swing the useless leg up. It was far from easy.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew shook his head in sympathy. &#x201c;Poor you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were due to come back to Edinburgh the following afternoon, but we cut our trip short and drove back the next morning. Domenica drove, in fact, as I couldn&#x2019;t move my leg. It was that painful.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew waited. He was thinking of Cultybraggan Camp and the generations of young men who had passed through it, for some of whom, of course, it had been the prelude to real conflict, to war with real explosives rather than the fireworks their instructors used to simulate explosions.<br><br>Angus continued his story. &#x201c;I saw my doctor in Edinburgh and he prescribed a pretty strong anti-inflammatory. Cyril had something similar from the vet when he caught his front paw in a drain cover. It did the trick for me. I also had a blood test.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d; prompted Matthew.<br><br>Angus looked morose, and Matthew wondered whether he was about to hear bad news; Angus did not look unwell, but then seriously ill people could often look perfectly healthy.<br><br>&#x201c;Gout,&#x201d; muttered Angus.<br><br>Matthew was relieved. &#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;At least . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He did not finish.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no joke,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;People make light of it, you know. They know that gout often goes for the big toe, and they find that amusing, for some reason. But it can flare up in other joints.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew started to grin, but checked himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, the diagnosis is not definite,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Apparently the only way in which you can really confirm gout is to stick a needle into the joint and see if there&#x2019;s any sign of uric acid crystals.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew, being squeamish, made a face.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s crystals that cause it,&#x201d; Angus continued. &#x201c;They form if your uric acid level is too high. They&#x2019;re shaped like needles&#x2014;hence the pain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And how do they treat it?&#x201d; asked Matthew.<br><br>Angus&#x2019;s face fell again. &#x201c;There are pills you can take,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They neutralise the uric acid. But you can also treat it by avoiding the foods that cause it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, there you are,&#x201d; said Matthew.<br><br>&#x201c;Which means cutting out everything I like the most,&#x201d; Angus said. &#x201c;Seafood, steak, red wine and . . .&#x201d; He pointed to his glass of beer. &#x201c;This stuff too.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew sympathised. &#x201c;Oh, bad luck.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was given a leaflet published by the British Gout Society,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;It tells you about all the foods you have to avoid&#x2014;or, if you must, eat in moderation.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew could not help but imagine meetings of the British Gout Society. &#x201c;The British Gout Society,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;Do you think they have an annual dance, like other societies?&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;Can you imagine how much fun that would be?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus looked at him reproachfully. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t find that at all funny,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And anybody can get it, you know. Not just men who drink port in clubs . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew assumed a serious expression. &#x201c;Of course. Sorry.&#x201d; The problem, he thought, was that so much humour involved human misfortune of one sort or another, and now that same human misfortune was out of bounds&#x2014;interdicted by self-appointed guardians of sensitivity. There was somebody to be offended by everything, he thought, which left little room for laughter.<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t making light of it, Angus. It&#x2019;s just that the name of the society . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Angus waved a hand. &#x201c;No, I know that. And I&#x2019;m not hyper-sensitive. But I don&#x2019;t think people should make light of gout. People don&#x2019;t laugh at other conditions.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew knew Angus was right, and decided that another change of subject was called for.<br><br>&#x201c;Bruce,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I saw him the other day, you know. He&#x2019;s back in circulation&#x2014;with a new Australian girlfriend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Poor girl,&#x201d; said Angus.<br><br>Matthew shook his head. &#x201c;If sympathy is called for,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;it should be directed towards Bruce. He&#x2019;s the one I feel sorry for.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I find that hard to believe,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Poor girl. Does she have any idea what he&#x2019;s like?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect she does,&#x201d; replied Matthew. &#x201c;If I had to describe her eyes, I think I&#x2019;d use the expression wide open.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Doe-eyed?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew shook his head. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Far from it.&#x201d;</p><h2>Daughter of the King: Growing Up in Gangland</h2><p>Sandi Lansky Lombardo grew up the only daughter of mob boss Meyer Lansky. Raised in upper-class Jewish splendor, first at the Majestic Hotel and then at the Beresford, at finishing schools and fancy stables, Sandi was the wild child of the late 40's, the 50's, and the early 60's. She was the Paris Hilton of her day, partying till dawn at El Morocco and the Stork Club, dating the biggest celebrities of the era. Her life was not without heartbreak and tragedy, including the insanity of her mother, and the crippling handicap of her baby brother &#x2013; not to mention his drug addiction.<br><br> Sandi was privy to her father's secrets as well as his unexpected tenderness. She always stuck closely to the strict code of omerta. In&nbsp;<i>Daughter of the King</i>, Sandi teams up with Nick Pileggi (author of the seminal&nbsp;<i>Wise Guy</i>, perhaps the best-selling mob book ever) and multiple time&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Bestselling writer Bill Stadiem. Nick has made a career in books and films chronicling the mob, and Bill has emerged as a master of recreating the glamour and romance of the golden era of American culture with bestsellers like&nbsp;<i>Mr. S</i>&nbsp;and George Hamilton's&nbsp;<i>Don't Mind if I Do</i>.</p><p><b>Sandra Lansky</b> lives in Florida with her husband.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>William Stadiem</b> is a multiple&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling writer and the author of eight books. He is a master of re-creating the glamour of America's golden era with his bestsellers&nbsp;<i>Marilyn Monroe Confidential, Mr. S: My</i>&nbsp;<i>Life with Frank Sinatra,&nbsp;</i>and George Hamilton's&nbsp;<i>Don't Mind If I Do</i>. He abandoned Wall Street for Sunset Boulevard, where he has since worked as a screenwriter, a columnist for Andy Warhol's&nbsp;<i>Interview</i>, and the restaurant critic for&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles</i>. He lives in Santa Monica, California.<br>Meyer Lansky (1902&#x2013;83) looms large in the history of American organized crime. He built a gambling empire, numbered Lucky Luciano and Bugsy Siegel among his friends and partners, and was instrumental in the creation of Las Vegas. He also helped create Murder Incorporated, the assassination arm of the American Mafia. And to Sandi Lansky, he was Daddy. This autobiography tells the story of a rich socialite, a party girl who lived in a world of wealth and glitz (Dean Martin was among her lovers) but whose life was permeated with darkness: a mother suffering from mental illness, a father who wasn&#x2019;t exactly the warmest dad in the world, friends and pseudo-relatives from the criminal world. (She refers to Benjamin &#x201c;Bugsy&#x201d; Siegel as Uncle Benny.) Everything in the book&#x2014;the murder of Siegel, the Kefauver Committee hearings into organized crime, her first marriage (when she was still a teenager)&#x2014;is filtered through Sandi&#x2019;s perceptions of her father and his world. It&#x2019;s not a crime story, exactly, but it is a fascinating account of a girl and her father, a man who happened to be a criminal. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Dream Life: Movies, Media, And The Mythology Of The Sixties</h2><p><p>In what the <i>New York Times</i>&#x2019;s A.O. Scott called a &#x201c;suave, scholarly tour de force,&#x201d; J. Hoberman delivers a brilliant and witty look at the decade when politics and pop culture became one.</p><p>This was the era of the Missile Gap and the Space Race, the Black and Sexual Revolutions, the Vietnam War and Watergate&#x2014;as well as the tele-saturation of the American market and the advent of Pop art. In &#x201c;elegant, epigrammatic prose,&#x201d; as Scott put it, Hoberman moves from the political histories of movies to the theater of wars, national political campaigns, and pop culture events.</p><p>With entertaining reinterpretations of key Hollywood movies (such as <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>, <i>The Wild Bunch</i>, and <i>Shampoo</i>), and meditations on personages from Che Guevara, John Wayne, and Patty Hearst to Jane Fonda, Ronald Reagan, and Dirty Harry, Hoberman reconstructs the hidden political history of 1960s cinema and the formation of America&#x2019;s mass-mediated politics.</p><br></p><p>J. Hoberman is the author, co-author, or editor of a dozen books, including the trilogy <i>The Dream Life</i>, <i>An Army of Phantoms</i>, and the forthcoming <i>Found Illusions</i> (all from The New Press) and <i>Film After Film</i>. He has written for <i>Artforum</i>, <i>Bookforum</i>, the <i>London Review of Books</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, and the <i>New York Review of Books</i>; contributes the &#x201c;On Video&#x201d; column for the <i>New York Times</i>; has taught cinema history at Cooper Union since 1990; and was, for over thirty years, a film critic for the <i>Village Voice</i>. He lives in New York.<br>For a book that doesn't so much drive home an overarching thesis about its subject as unravel particular events that are dense with historical, political and cinematic import, this assessment of the 1960s and its aftermath by longtime Village Voice critic Hoberman packs a salient and unique wallop. Hoberman wants to remind readers that the '60s marked the first time in American history when "[m]ovies might be political events, and political events were experienced as movies." It is a lesson that by now seems fairly obvious, but the book's power lies in its assessment of how new and forceful the heady combination of politics and visual mass media was, as politicians began to stress their images in addition to their words, and the restrictive Hays Code, which had tightly governed mass media content, loosened. Although the book contains much political analysis, it's a rare history that also reveals the era's sensibilities. Hoberman does so by employing language of the time (when discussing Gordon Park Jr.'s Superfly, he describes the protagonist's "incredible pad" and his "mockery of the honky police") and by using a plethora of sources: Norman Mailer's contemporary writings, popular magazines like Life, the political news of the time, box office stats, etc. Hoberman's usual epigrammatic wit ("Easy Rider is, even in 1968, a costume movie") is on display here, making his long sections of political examinations more bearable.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Love Without Borders: How Bold Faith Opens the Door to Embracing the Unexpected</h2><p><p><strong>From the founder of This Gathered Nest YouTube channel, an uplifting story of Angela Braniff's&nbsp;unusual path to becoming the mother to seven children through various methods of adoption and biological approaches, encouraging women and mothers to embrace the unique purpose that God has put in their lives.</strong><br><br>Angela&#x2019;s love for life and her family radiates through everything she does.

Le Guin. </b><br><br> Vanja, an information assistant, is sent from her home city of Essre to the austere, wintry colony of Amatka with an assignment to collect intelligence for the government. Immediately she feels that something strange is going on: people act oddly in Amatka, and citizens are monitored for signs of subversion.<br><br> Intending to stay just a short while, Vanja falls in love with her housemate, Nina, and prolongs her visit. But when she stumbles on evidence of a growing threat to the colony, and a cover-up by its administration, she embarks on an investigation that puts her at tremendous risk.<br><br>In Karin Tidbeck&#x2019;s world, everyone is suspect, no one is safe, and nothing&#x2014;not even language, nor the very fabric of reality&#x2014;can be taken for granted. <i>Amatka&nbsp;</i>is a beguiling and wholly original novel about freedom, love, and artistic creation by a captivating new voice.</p><p>Karin Tidbeck is originally from Stockholm, Sweden. She lives and works in Malmï¿½ as a freelance writer, translator, and creative-writing teacher, and writes fiction in Swedish and English. She debuted in 2010 with the Swedish short story collection <i>Vem ï¿½r Arvid Pekon?</i> Her English debut, the 2012 collection <i>Jagannath</i>, was awarded the Crawford Award 2013 and short-listed for the World Fantasy Award.THE TRAIN<br> &nbsp;<br> Brilars' Vanja Essre Two, information assistant with the Essre Hygiene Specialists, was the only passenger on the auto-train bound for Amatka. As soon as she had climbed the steps, the door shut behind her and the train jerked into motion. Vanja took a new grip on her satchel and typewriter case, and pushed the suitcase through the sliding door with her feet. On the other side, the darkness was complete. She fumbled along the wall and found a circuit breaker next to the door. The light that flickered on was weak and yellow.<br><br> The narrow space of the passenger car was bare except for the brown vinyl bunk couches that lined the walls and the luggage racks, stacked with blankets and thin pillows, which were wide enough to sleep on too. It was built for migration, for transporting pioneers to new frontiers, and its capacity was pointless here. One didn't travel to Amatka unless one had to.<br><br> Vanja left her bags by the door and sat on each of the couches. They were all equally rigid and uncomfortable. The upholstery looked slippery, but felt unpleasantly rough to the touch. She chose the couch at the far right-hand corner, where she'd be close to the common room and have a good view of the rest of the car. It was all vaguely reminiscent of the dormitory in Children's House Two so long ago: the same vinyl mattresses under the sheets, the same lingering scent of bodies. But back then the room had been full of children and the sound of their voices. <br><br> She took a look at the tiny common room. The only window in the car was on the right wall, low and wide with rounded edges and a roll-down curtain. On closer inspection, the window turned out no to be an ordinary window, but a white screen that lit up at the press of a button. It was probably meant as a substitute for daylight. Under the screen, a table was bolted to the floor along with four chairs. One of the two high cabinets on the other side of the room held a tiny lavatory with a washbasin, the other a small pantry with preserves and fresh root vegetables. Everything was marked in large and comforting letters: WASHBASIN, PANTRY, TABLE. This area smelled vaguely of manure, either from the lavatory or from the containers that rode at the front of the train. <br><br> Vanja fetched her suitcase and undid the buckles. One of them looked like it was about to come loose. It had been a gift from someone, who had inherited it from someone else, and so on. In any case, it wasn't going to last long: the word SUITCASE was almost illegible. She could fill in the letters of course, but the question was what would happen first &#x2013; that the bag simply fell apart from wear, or that it dissolved when she put it away. She really ought to scrap it.&nbsp;<br><br>"Suitcase," Vanja whispered, to keep it its shape just a little longer. "Suitcase, suitcase."<br> She flipped the backrest to free up the lower bunk, and made the bed with the set of sheets she'd brought. They too would soon need new marking.<br><br> The preserves in the pantry were apparently meant to be eaten cold. Vanja found a spoon and pulled the lid off one of the cans. According to the ingredient list, it contained "stew with a base of mycoprotein," which meant a smooth, bland paste that stuck to the roof of her mouth. Vanja forced down half of the can's contents and put it back in the pantry. The vegetables were fresh, and tasted better. She cut a chunk of rutabaga into smaller pieces and slowly ate them one by one.<br><br> The train car swayed gently back and forth; a rhythmic pounding noise emerged through the floor, and though this must mean that the train was moving forward, it was impossible to tell at what speed. The window screen grew dim. Vanja looked at the clock on her wrist. The second indicator was stuck at one o' clock, twitching. She had forgotten to follow instructions; she should have left it at home or handed it in at the station. Looking at it while on the train was a bad idea. Unless they were made from fine matter, mechanical things sometimes didn't behave like they should between the colonies. The train was safe, of course, but the little clock might not be. Vanja took it off and put it in her pocket.<br><br> She went back into the main car and changed into sleep clothes. They were getting too big for her, again. Her breasts dangled half-empty on her ribs; her belly no longer sagged from fat but from loose skin and flaccid musculature; her legs were no longer firm. She knew her face had thinned down in the same doughy manner, its warm bronze yellowed and fading into the shade of her dull eyes and hair in a nondescript spectrum of brown. She looked older than she was. Her supervisor, Illas Pia, had treated her with exaggerated care. This is an important mission, she had said, so take all the time you need. No need to hurry. It was an important mission, carried out with the committee's blessing. She was, after all, the first of her kind.<br><br> Vanja left the ceiling light on and huddled up under the blanket. Everyone knew that there was nothing out there except the empty steppe: billowing grass, some hillocks and combes. The lack of windows was just a security measure. She tried to give in to the rocking of the train. The corner should have felt safe, but it didn't. The walls were too thin, a frail shell between her and the unseen landscape through which she was traveling.</p><h2>The Ghost Ship of Brooklyn: An Untold Story of the American Revolution</h2><p><b>The most horrific struggle of the American Revolution occurred just 100 yards off New York, where more men died aboard a rotting prison ship than were lost to combat during the entirety of the war.</b><br><br>Moored off the coast of Brooklyn until the end of the war, the derelict ship, the HMS <i>Jersey</i>, was a living hell for thousands of Americans either captured by the British or accused of disloyalty. Crammed below deck--a shocking one thousand at a time--without light or fresh air, the prisoners were scarcely fed food and water. Disease ran rampant and human waste fouled the air as prisoners suffered mightily at the hands of brutal British and Hessian guards. Throughout the colonies, the mere mention of the ship sparked fear and loathing of British troops. It also sparked a backlash of outrage as newspapers everywhere described the horrors onboard the ghostly ship. This shocking event, much like the better-known Boston Massacre before it, ended up rallying public support for the war.<br><br>Revealing for the first time hundreds of accounts culled from old newspapers, diaries, and military reports, award-winning historian Robert P.

A young nun who entered a convent at fifteen and died at twenty-four, Th?r?se roused an incredible storm of spontaneous veneration only a few months after her death, and has been called by one Pope as the greatest saint of the modern times. Countless images of the sweetly smiling saint flooded the world. But who was she, really?&nbsp;<i>The Hidden Face</i>&nbsp;has sprung from this question. It presents the true Therese, as objectively as possible, and gives a convincing interpretation of her sainthood. It is a book not for Catholics alone, but for anyone fascinated by the force of spirituality, by the incalculable effects of what Pascal called the "greatness of the human soul." It opens the cloistered world of the Carmel, takes off the sugar coating, and reveals the stark drama behind convent walls, the tension between personalities, the daily details of conventual life. And it throws light on the tremendous purifying process that turned the pampered darling into a saint of heroic virtue.</p><p>The work of a mind of rare intelligence and integrity, this book is unique among the lives of saints. First published in Germany in 1944, the original is now in its eighth edition.

Political and passionate, this bilingual picture book about the L.A. janitors' strike in 2000 gives a voice to contemporary urban Latino working-class families. With the English text at the top of each page and the Spanish translation below, the story is told in the first person by Carlitos, a Mexican immigrant child, whose widowed mother cleans offices nights and weekends but still can't manage to support her family. After Mama tells Carlitos that she is helping to organize a janitors' strike for a union, Carlitos gets support at school from his teacher and classmates, and he joins the march with a sign that reads: "I love my Mama. She is a janitor!" Delgado's bright, active pastel pictures, much like poster art, are reminiscent of the work of Mexican artist Orozco, with pulsing scenes of marching crowds in the streets as well as warm close-ups of people at work and home. Carlitos' story is framed by lots of politics for group discussion, and the inside of the dust jacket is a poster with art and text about labor history. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

This interconnectedness penetrates all dimensions of life. No being, construct, or object can exist independently from the ecological entanglement, Morton contends, nor does &#x201c;Nature&#x201d; exist as an entity separate from the uglier or more synthetic elements of life. Realizing this interconnectedness is what Morton calls the ecological thought. </p><p>In three concise chapters, Morton investigates the profound philosophical, political, and aesthetic implications of the fact that all life forms are interconnected. As a work of environmental philosophy and theory, <i>The Ecological Thought</i> explores an emerging awareness of ecological reality in an age of global warming. Using Darwin and contemporary discoveries in life sciences as root texts, Morton describes a mesh of deeply interconnected life forms&#x2015;intimate, strange, and lacking fixed identity.</p><p>A &#x201c;prequel&#x201d; to his <i>Ecology without Nature: Rethinking Environmental Aesthetics</i> (Harvard, 2007), <i>The Ecological Thought</i> is an engaged and accessible work that will challenge the thinking of readers in disciplines ranging from critical theory to Romanticism to cultural geography.</p></p><p>Timothy Morton is Rita Shea Guffey Chair of English at Rice University.&#x201c;Morton writes from inside the ecological thought, not as its cheerleader or architect but as a latter-day Romantic. The great strength of this book is its genre inventiveness, and its main contribution is its performance of a thinking keyed to our time and place, a thinking with clear and immediate ethical implications. <i>The Ecological Thought</i> is crucial right now.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Marjorie Levinson, University of Michigan</b><br><br>&#x201c;Picking up where his most obvious predecessors, Gregory Bateson and Felix Guattari, left off, Morton understands mental ecology as the ground zero of ecological thinking, as that which must be redressed before anything else and above all. Morton goes beyond both his forebears, however, in repairing the rift between science and the humanities, which the Enlightenment opened up and against which Romanticism reacted. Perhaps most pleasantly surprising, given its erudition, is that in its stylistic elegance <i>The Ecological Thought</i> is as satisfying to read as it is necessary to ponder.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Vince Carducci, College for Creative Studies</b><br><br>&#x201c;Timothy Morton has a unique take on ecology that challenges much of the alternative consciousness that floats around on the periphery of environmental circles. He offers a profound take on human possibilities. To Morton, human society and Nature are not two distinct things but rather two different angles on the same thing.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Tikkun</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;By suggesting imaginative ways to resolve other crises, could humanities scholars stave off the crisis engulfing their own subjects? Morton proposes a future in which the venerable ideas of "nature" and "environment" are so much detritus, useless for addressing a looming ecological catastrophe. His book exemplifies the "serious" humanities scholarship he makes a plea for. My head's still spinning.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Noel Castree</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Morton's The Ecological Thought rejects the romantic concept of nature as a passive foil to human action. The natural world, as it turns out, is not something outside of us; or, put another way: there is no difference between humans and our environment...He asks us to engage in "radical openness" as a way of practicing "radical coexistence," a state of being that we live even when we do not think much about it...Morton's book allows us to see our stirrings of sympathy for nonhuman beings such as strawberries as the beginning of a recognition that we have all--people and plants alike--lost long ago our presumed roots in an imagined natural world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Natania Meeker and Antï¿½nia Szabari</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b></p><h2>Serve To Win: The 14-day Gluten-free Plan For Physical And Mental Excellence</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><b>Novak Djokovic</b> is a Serbian tennis player who is ranked World #1 by the Association of Tennis Professionals. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time.Introduction<br><br>The Diet That Transformed Me<br><br>From the brink of failure to the champion of the world&#x2014;in 18 months<br><br>Just as I was reaching for the top, I hit bottom.<br><br>I was nineteen years old, an unknown kid from a war-torn country, who had suddenly burst onto the professional scene. I was on a nine-match winning streak and poised to take a commanding lead in the final round of the 2006 Croatia Open. The stadium crowd was on my side, my team was cheering me on.<br><br>And yet I couldn&#x2019;t hear them. All I could hear was the roaring in my head. All I could feel was pain. Something was pinching my nose closed, bear-hugging my chest, pouring concrete into my legs.<br><br>I looked across the net at my opponent, Stanislas Wawrinka. I looked into the stands, where my mother sat. And then, suddenly, gravity sucked me backward onto the red clay court, and I was looking up at the open Croatian sky, my chest heaving. The Curse&#x2014;the mysterious force that sapped my strength without warning&#x2014;had closed in on me once more.<br><br>No matter how hard I inhaled, the air would not come.<br><br>My father, Srdjan, ran out onto the court, and with a doctor, lifted me up by my arms and sat me down in my courtside chair. I looked up at my mother, sobbing in the stands, and I knew. This tournament was over. And maybe my life&#x2019;s dream was over, too.<br><br>Most people don&#x2019;t decide what they want from life when they&#x2019;re six years old, but I had. Thirteen years earlier, sitting in the tiny living room over my parents&#x2019; pizza parlor in a remote mountain town of Kopaonik in rural Serbia, I watched Pete Sampras win Wimbledon, and I knew: One day that would be me.<br><br>I&#x2019;d never played tennis. No one I knew played tennis. In Serbia, tennis was as obscure a sport as, say, fencing. And the glamour of London was about as far as you could get from the desolate little resort town where my family lived. Yet at that very moment, I knew what I wanted more than anything: I wanted to lift the Wimbledon cup over my head, hear the crowd cheer, and know I had become the number one player in the world.<br><br>My parents had bought me a little rainbow-colored racquet and some Wiffle balls when I was four, and I would entertain myself for hours, hitting the balls against the wall of the restaurant. But from the moment I saw Sampras that day, I knew. And for the next thirteen years, I gave every day of my life to reaching my goal. My family, who made countless sacrifices; my friends who supported me from the beginning; my trainers and coaches and fans&#x2014;they all came together to get me as close to my life&#x2019;s dream as possible.<br><br>But there was something about me that was broken, unhealthy, unfit. Some called it allergies, some called it asthma, some just called it being out of shape. But no matter what we called it, no one knew how to fix it.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time I&#x2019;d collapsed in a big tournament. A year earlier, ranked just 153rd in the world, I shocked 8th-seed Guillermo Coria by taking the first set of our match in my very first French Open appearance. But by the third set, my legs turned to rock, and I couldn&#x2019;t breathe, and finally I resigned. &#x201c;Obviously, he was tired after a while,&#x201d; Coria remarked afterward. &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re fit, you ought to be able to play a long match in hot weather.&#x201d;<br><br>Three months later, in the opening round of my first US Open, playing against Gael Monfils, I literally collapsed on the court. I lay on my back like a beached whale in the humid 80-degree heat, laboring for breath, waiting for a trainer. After four embarrassing time-outs, I managed to win that match, but I was booed off the court, and my lack of fitness was the talk of the tournament. &#x201c;Maybe he ought to change some things,&#x201d; Monfils suggested.<br><br>I tried. In professional tennis today, the slightest change in your skill level, your physical conditioning, and your mindset make all the difference. I practiced every morning and every afternoon, I lifted weights, I biked or ran for hours at a stretch every single day. It made no sense that I was unfit. I changed trainers, looking for a new workout regimen. I changed coaches, thinking that something in my technique would free me from this curse. I had nasal surgery, hoping that would allow me to breathe more freely. Each change helped, a little; season by season, I grew a little stronger and fitter. In 2007, I became only the second player to beat both Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal since their ascent to the top of the game.<br><br>Yet every time I took a big step toward my dream, I felt as though a rope were around my torso, pulling me back. Professional tennis is one continuous, eleven-month-long season, and the key to consistency is being able to recover quickly from one match to the next. I&#x2019;d win one tournament, then collapse unexpectedly in the next; win one epic match, then retire in the middle of the following round.<br><br>Maybe my problem wasn&#x2019;t physical, but mental: I took up meditation, then yoga, trying to calm my mind. My training became obsessive: For fourteen hours a day, every single day, I did nothing but focus on improving my mental and physical game. And in the process, I became one of the top ten tennis players in the world.<br><br>But I had a dream, and it wasn&#x2019;t to be &#x201c;one of&#x201d; the best. There were two men in the world who were the best&#x2014;Federer and Nadal&#x2014;and to them, I was nothing but an occasional annoyance&#x2014;one who might quit at any moment when the going got tough. These guys were the elite; I was stuck somewhere in the second tier.<br><br>I won my first Grand Slam, the Australian Open, in January of 2008&#x2014;a breakthrough. But a year later, against Andy Roddick, I once again had to retire from the tournament. The defending champion, and I quit?! What was wrong with me? &#x201c;Cramp, bird flu, anthrax, SARS, common cough and cold,&#x201d; Roddick said about me, making fun of the fact that I so often fell ill. Even Federer, who&#x2019;s so quiet and gentlemanly, dismissed me when talking to reporters: &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s a joke, you know, when it comes down to his injuries.&#x201d;<br><br>At the end of 2009, I even moved my training camp to Abu Dhabi, hoping that by practicing in the sizzling heat of the Persian Gulf, I&#x2019;d be better prepared for the Australian Open in Melbourne. Maybe by acclimating myself better, I&#x2019;d finally beat this thing. <br><br>And at first, it looked as though I&#x2019;d finally figured it all out. By January 27, 2010, I&#x2019;d made it to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, handling my opposition easily along the way. Across the net in my quarterfinal match was Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the tenth-ranked tennis player in the world. I was ranked number three. Two years earlier to the day, I&#x2019;d beaten him on this very court on my way to winning my first Grand Slam tournament at age twenty-one. And on this day, I needed to be just as good. No, better.<br><br>Tsonga is two hundred pounds of pure muscle, one of the biggest and strongest players in the game, and his serve comes in at 140 miles an hour. When he puts his body weight into a return, the ball comes in &#x201c;heavy,&#x201d; with a combination of speed and topspin that feels like it could knock the racquet right out of your hand. And yet he moves with great quickness around the court. On this day, in his neon yellow T-shirt, he looked as big as the sun, and just as relentless. He had taken the first set, 7&#x2013;6, after a punishing tiebreaker that drove the crowd to their feet over and over again.<br><br>But in by the second set, my obsessive preparation finally started to take over. I took the second set, 7&#x2013;6, and then I began to control him, running him back and forth along the baseline. The singles court is twenty-seven feet from side to side, and I could cover that distance as well as anyone.<br><br>I took the third set easily, 6&#x2013;1. I had him.<br><br>And then it happened, again. With Tsonga up 1&#x2013;0 in the fourth set, the invisible force attacked. I couldn&#x2019;t breathe. When he took the next game, something rose up in my throat; I pleaded with the chair umpire for a toilet break. I didn&#x2019;t want my opponent to see what I was about to do.<br><br>I raced into the locker room, burst into a stall, and fell to my knees. Gripping the side of the toilet bowl, my stomach in spasms, I felt as though I were vomiting up all of my strength. <br><br>When I walked back onto the court, I was a different player.<br><br>Tsonga knew my body was breaking down, and holding serve, he could run me back and forth across the court like a toy. I felt the crowd shift to his side, and his serve seemed faster, heavier&#x2014;or maybe I was slower, weaker. It was as though I were playing against a giant. More than once, his shots left my feet stuck to the blue Plexicushion surface; I simply couldn&#x2019;t move them. He took the fourth set, 6&#x2013;3.<br><br>By the start of the fifth set, it was clear to everyone in the park how this match would turn out. Serving 0&#x2013;40, with Tsonga up 3&#x2013;1, I hit the lowest point of my career. It was break point, in more ways than one.<br><br>I had to deliver a perfect serve, knock him off balance, regain some control. If there was one chance for me to battle back, I needed to make this serve the best of the hundreds of thousands I&#x2019;d hit in my lifetime.<br><br>Bounce, bounce. I tossed the ball in the air. I tried to expand my torso to get full extension, but my entire chest felt tight. It was as though I was swinging Thor&#x2019;s hammer instead of a tennis racquet.<br><br>My body was broken.<br><br>Fault.<br><br>My mind was broken. Bounce, bounce. Serve.<br><br>Double-fault.<br><br>Game, Tsonga.<br><br>The end came quickly and mercifully, like an execution. After shaking hands at midcourt, he danced around the park, urging on the crowd, full of power and energy. I was drained. Seventeen years of practicing every single day, and yet I did not feel physically or mentally strong enough to be on the same court with the game&#x2019;s best.<br><br>I had the skills, the talent, the drive. I had the resources to try every kind of mental and physical training known to man, and access to the finest doctors in the world. What was really holding me back was something I&#x2019;d never have suspected. I was training and practicing right.<br><br>But I was eating all wrong.<br><br>The Diet That Changed My Life<br><br>My professional low was that double-fault on January 27, 2010.<br><br>And yet, by July 2011&#x2014;just eighteen months later&#x2014;I was a different man. Eleven pounds lighter, stronger than ever, and healthier than I&#x2019;d been since early childhood, I achieved my two life goals: to win Wimbledon, and to be named the number one tennis player in the world. As I watched a last, desperate backhand from Rafael Nadal land long to give me the Wimbledon Cup, I saw myself as that six-year-old boy again, the one who came from nothing, innocently grasping at an impossible dream.<br><br>I fell to the ground. I threw my hands in the air. I crouched down, pulled some of the grass from the Wimbledon court, and ate it.<br><br>It tasted like sweat. My sweat. But I&#x2019;d never tasted anything so sweet.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t a new training program that took me from being a very good player to the best player in the world in just eighteen months. It wasn&#x2019;t a new racquet, a new workout, a new coach, or even a new serve that helped me lose weight, find mental focus, and enjoy the best health of my life.<br><br>It was a new diet.<br><br>My life had changed because I had begun to eat the right foods for my body, in the way that my body demanded. In the first three months of my new diet, I dropped from 181 pounds to 172&#x2014;my family and friends even began to worry that I was getting too skinny. But I felt fresher, more alert, and more energetic than I had in my life. I was faster, more flexible, and able to get to balls other players couldn&#x2019;t, yet I was still as strong as I&#x2019;d ever been, and my mental focus was unshakable. I never felt tired or out of breath. My allergies abated; my asthma disappeared; my fears and doubts were replaced by confidence. I have not had a serious cold or flu in nearly three years.<br><br>Some sportswriters have called my 2011 season the greatest single year ever by a professional tennis player. I won ten titles, three Grand Slams, and forty-three consecutive matches. And the only thing I&#x2019;d changed was what I was eating.<br><br>What amazed me the most was how simple these changes were to make, and how dramatic the results were. All I did was eliminate gluten&#x2014;the protein found in wheat&#x2014;for a few days, and my body instantly felt better. I was lighter, quicker, clearer in mind and spirit. After two weeks, I knew that my life had changed. I made a few more tweaks, cutting down on sugar, cutting out dairy, and I could tell the moment I woke up each morning that I was different than I had been, maybe since childhood. I sprang out of bed, ready to tear into the day ahead. And I realized that I had to share what I&#x2019;d learned with others.<br><br>You do not have to be a professional athlete to make the simple nutritional adjustments outlined in this book, and you certainly don&#x2019;t have to be a tennis pro for them to improve your body, your health, and your outlook on life.<br><br>In fact, what I&#x2019;m going to share with you isn&#x2019;t a diet in the strict sense of the word, because that implies that you&#x2019;re only going to eat exactly what I tell you to eat. That wouldn&#x2019;t make sense. Most diet programs assume the same plan works for everyone and that you &#x201c;must&#x201d; eat certain foods, whether you&#x2019;re a 27-year-old tennis player, a 35-year-old mother of two, or a 50-year-old executive vice president. That&#x2019;s silly. &#x201c;Must&#x201d; just isn&#x2019;t a good word. Your body is an entirely different machine from mine. Look at your fingertips: Your prints are unlike anyone else&#x2019;s in the world. This is proof that your body is different from anyone else&#x2019;s in the world. I don&#x2019;t want you to eat the best diet for my body. I&#x2019;m going to show you how to find the best diet for your own unique self.<br><br>Simple Changes, Big Results</p><h2>The Smell of the Night (An Inspector Montalbano Mystery)</h2><p><b><b><b>&#x201c;You either love Andrea Camilleri or you haven&#x2019;t read him yet.

The controversy pushed Massachusetts to the brink of collapse and spurred a significant exodus. The Puritans who founded Massachusetts were poised between the Middle Ages and the modern world, and in many ways, they helped to bring the modern world into being. <em>The Trial of Anne Hutchinson</em> plunges participants into a religious world that will be unfamiliar to many of them. Yet the Puritans&#x2019; passionate struggles over how far they could tolerate a diversity of religious opinions in a colony committed to religious unity were part of a larger historical process that led to religious freedom and the modern concept of separation of church and state. Their vehement commitment to their liberties and fears about the many threats these faced were passed down to the American Revolution and beyond.<br><br><p><em>Reacting to the Past</em> is a series of historical role-playing games that explore important ideas by re-creating the contexts that shaped them. Students are assigned roles, informed by classic texts, set in particular moments of intellectual and social ferment.</p><p>An award-winning active-learning pedagogy, <em>Reacting to the Past</em> improves speaking, writing, and leadership skills, promotes engagement with classic texts and history, and builds learning communities. <em>Reacting</em> can be used across the curriculum, from the first-year general education class to &#x201c;capstone&#x201d; experiences.

If you&#x2019;re not comfortable with that&#x2014;if you like the lines between the living and the dead to be a little more cleanly drawn&#x2014;this is your chance to bail. This is also a love story, in a sideways sort of way, and a story about second chances you never wanted and can&#x2019;t refuse. It&#x2019;s my story.<br><br>My name is Rose.&nbsp;<br><br>The living are never as far from the dead as they want to be, or as they need to believe they are. Tell someone a murder&#x2019;s been committed in their house and the sale value goes through the floor. Tell them the field where they&#x2019;re standing was the site of some brutal massacre or terrible battle and suddenly they&#x2019;ll claim to have felt the bad vibes all along&#x2014;and hell, for some of them, maybe that&#x2019;s true. There have always been people who are more sensitive to the desires of the dead than others. But I&#x2019;ll bet you most of them either wouldn&#x2019;t have entered that field in the first place, or actively enjoy the company of hostile spirits.<br><br>Who am I to judge? I&#x2019;ve been known to enjoy the company of a hostile spirit or two.&nbsp;<br><br>Regardless, since the world began, the living have walked on a shallow crust of mortality, balancing above the great chasms of the dead. We dig our own graves deeper and deeper, some of us out of a misplaced desire to give the living space, others because they hate what they don&#x2019;t have, heartbeats and breath and an understanding of mortality that doesn&#x2019;t take eternity into account. Dead folk like me, we occupy a level of the afterlife called the twilight, where the things the living love still <i>are</i>, just . . . twisted a little out of true, modified by the realization that physical reality isn&#x2019;t all that big a deal. Dead folk in the twilight, for lack of a better way to put it, mostly want to go about our lives in peace. We want to work and play and get what we pay for and own what we build. Twilight ghosts can be malicious, sure, but for the most part, we aren&#x2019;t out to cause trouble.<br><br>For the most part. That makes it sound like some big, homogenous, weirdly sanitized version of a haunting, where all the ghosts are polite and all the rules are clearly posted at the city limits. The sort of place where the good stuff happens behind closed doors and the bad stuff happens in the town square under the guise of words like &#x201c;morality&#x201d; and &#x201c;faith.&#x201d; And those levels of the twilight exist, because see, we&#x2019;re one little slice of what waits on the other side of living, but they&#x2019;re a long way from the only thing that&#x2019;s down there.<br><br>The world of the dead is vast and deep and sprawling, and the only thing that matters is how far a body can dive before the pressure starts getting to them. So yeah, there are Elysian slices of the twilight. There are small towns that would make Ray Bradbury cream his chinos, places where it&#x2019;s always Halloween and it never rains. For all I know, he&#x2019;s the Mayor of one of those little places now, wiling away the endless hours as he lives out his own stories. If he is, that&#x2019;s fine with me, for all that you&#x2019;d never catch me in one of those tar pits of nostalgic sentimentality. Been there, done that, didn&#x2019;t survive it the first time.<br><br>Below the twilight you have the starlight, and under that you have the midnight, and if those seem like trite ways to label a place that isn&#x2019;t a place, one that predates our current ideas about the living and the dead, remember that the dead are still people. We get to be trite and simplistic and weird. There are sublevels, slices where the light varies, where the ghosts of stars shine a little brighter or disappear altogether, but those are the big ones.&nbsp;<br><br>And connecting them all, winding through them like a ribbon tangled in a dead girl&#x2019;s hair, are the ghostroads.<br><br>No one built them; no one had to. As long as there&#x2019;s been life in this world, there have been roads, paths that were a sliver more convenient or easier to travel. Shortcuts became trails became highways, until they fell, for whatever reason, out of favor. But life isn&#x2019;t as easy to categorize as some folks would like, and anything that&#x2019;s used enough, loved enough, favored enough, will eventually find its own way of living. So when those trails stopped being used, when those roads were skipped over in order to build a new overpass, when the weeds grew through the concrete and erosion pulled the stones away, they came here.<br><br>Only roads don&#x2019;t want to build bucolic little towns and call them &#x201c;Heaven.&#x201d; Roads want to <i>go</i>. The ghostroads connect all the levels and lands of the dead, not only to each other, but to the lands of the living.<br><br>That&#x2019;s where I come in.<br><br>I was born in 1936, third of three and the only girl in a house that seemed to consist more of draft than timber. Daddy made it eight years before the pressure got to be too much and he split. He&#x2019;s got to be dead by now, one more phantom drifting somewhere out there in the void, and he must have heard that his darling girl went and made something of herself, me, Rosie Marshall, the Phantom Prom Date, the Girl in the Green Silk Gown. Me, Rosie Marshall, who broke every rule and somehow kept on going. If he&#x2019;s impressed by what I grew up to be, he&#x2019;s never cared enough to come and tell me about it. That&#x2019;s all right. I got here without him. I sure don&#x2019;t need him now.<br><br>Me, I made it eight years further than my father. I stayed in Buckley Township until the day I died, sweet sixteen and dressed in a green silk gown I&#x2019;d worked my fingers to the bone to afford. The man who ran me off the road should never have been there. I was an innocent, and he was a predator, and Bobby&#x2019;s always liked them sweet and virginal and so damn <i>young</i>. Like I was.<br><br>He doesn&#x2019;t care much for me anymore. Not young enough, not innocent enough, not helpless enough by half. That&#x2019;s all right. I don&#x2019;t care much for him. Bobby Cross isn&#x2019;t dead, but he&#x2019;s going to wish he was when I finally catch up to him. He killed me once. I figure it&#x2019;s only right for me to return the favor.<br><br>There&#x2019;s ways to put a spirit on the ghostroads, and one of the finest and fastest is dying behind the wheel. I was on the road when he ran me down, and I&#x2019;ve been on the road ever since. I&#x2019;m that girl you see walking down the highway median with my thumb cocked to the sun, inviting anyone who wants a little trouble to pick me up and find out where I&#x2019;m going. I&#x2019;m the runaway in the truck stop and the teenager playing on the rest stop swings with not a car in sight to get her wherever it is she might be going. I&#x2019;m harmless, as long as you treat me kindly. I&#x2019;m so long dead that I&#x2019;ve got nothing left to fear.<br><br>Folks can call me what they like. I&#x2019;ve got my fans and my detractors, people who say I&#x2019;m a menace and people who say I&#x2019;m the ghost of a saint. It doesn&#x2019;t bother me. Call me the walking girl of Route 42; call me the girl in the diner or the phantom prom date. I&#x2019;ll still be Rose, just Rose, pretty Rose Marshall who died too young and refused to lie quiet in her grave. Like I&#x2019;ve said and will keep on saying, I&#x2019;m just one more girl who raced and lost in the hand of the forest, the shade of the hill, on the hairpin curves of that damned deadly road.<br><br>People call me a lot of things these days. The ones who know me, though . . .&nbsp;<br><br>The ones who know me call me Rose.<br><br>* * * * *&nbsp;<br><br>The neon sign in the window glows a steady green, painting the parking lot in shades of shamrock, glinting off the broken glass on the pavement and the intact windscreen of the lone car snuggled up to the curb. There&#x2019;s always broken glass on the pavement in a parking lot like this one, even as far down into the twilight as I am right now. Where it comes from is a mystery a little bit above my pay grade, and so I leave it alone. It can be somebody else&#x2019;s problem, if it&#x2019;s a problem at all. Even broken things are beautiful when the light hits them the right way.<br><br>&#x201c;Order up,&#x201d; calls Emma, and hits the press- top bell she keeps for just such occasions. She beams at me as she walks my white paper bag and insulated cup over, setting them down on the counter in front of me. &#x201c;From my hands to yours, Rosie-my-girl, fresh and good as anything. How&#x2019;s your boy?&#x201d;<br><br>I cast a fond glance at the single car in the parking lot as I pick up my dinner. Unnecessary, yes: the dead don&#x2019;t <i>need</i> to eat, any more than the living are generally bound to the weird little metaphysical necessities that plague your average spirit. But some of us <i>like </i>eating, enjoy the reminder it represents of the days when we were human, and mortality was something that happened to other people. Also, I dare you to find anyone who wasn&#x2019;t lactose-intolerant in the 1950s and yet still somehow failed to pick up a solid appreciation for a good chocolate malt.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s doing all right,&#x201d; I say, affection and exasperation in my tone. That&#x2019;s always struck me as the best mix. True love isn&#x2019;t all chocolate-dipped strawberries and perfect harmony. It&#x2019;s work, work you enjoy doing, but work all the same. As long as love can drive you crazy and bring you back for more at the same time, it&#x2019;s a good thing.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a big change for you, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; There&#x2019;s a delicacy in Emma&#x2019;s tone that I don&#x2019;t hear very often, and don&#x2019;t particularly care for. I&#x2019;ve known her for almost as long as I&#x2019;ve been dead, and while I love her milkshakes, I hate her mothering. &#x201c;For both of you. You&#x2019;re used to making your way around the ghostroads alone, and he&#x2019;s used to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Having thumbs, yes.&#x201d; I gave Emma a challenging look. &#x201c;Is this you warming up to asking about our sex life? Because I swear, I will demand <i>so many milkshakes</i> if the question &#x2018;how do you fuck a car&#x2019; passes your lips.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you won&#x2019;t answer it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good, because I don&#x2019;t actually want to know. I just want to know that the two of you are happy, and that you&#x2019;re treading easy with each other. It really is a big change, Rosie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You think I didn&#x2019;t notice that part?&#x201d; I set down my bag long enough to jam a straw into my malt and take a slurping sip. Chocolate cherry explodes in my mouth, and my irritation melts a few notches. Trust Emma to give me the goods before she starts asking inappropriate questions.<br><br>&#x201c;I think you noticed, I just also think the shock is going to wear off soon.&#x201d; She shakes her head. &#x201c;Honeymoon periods are another way of saying &#x2018;the mind hasn&#x2019;t wrapped itself all the way around a change&#x2019; yet. I don&#x2019;t want you to break that boy&#x2019;s heart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hold on a second here,&#x201d; I protest. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you afraid of <i>him</i> breaking <i>my</i> heart?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sweetie, you moved on sixty years ago. You&#x2019;ve always been carrying a torch for the one who got you home&#x2014;only time anybody ever took the time, and I know you haven&#x2019;t forgotten that&#x2014;but he&#x2019;s been carrying a whole damn forest fire. He turned himself into a car to have half a prayer of being able to stay with you in whatever passed for an afterlife, and he did it all on<i> faith</i>, Rose. Faith. How often do we see the kind of faith that can do that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not often,&#x201d; I admit. &#x201c;Gary&#x2019;s special.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He is. But him having faith doesn&#x2019;t mean you owe him anything. You understand that, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>I pause, blinking, and have to swallow a laugh. Emma&#x2019;s feelings will be hurt if I laugh at her. She&#x2019;s only trying to help me, and it&#x2019;s not her fault that she doesn&#x2019;t understand my relationship better. It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;ve been exactly forthcoming up to this point, and really, how could I be? This is uncharted territory for the both of us.<br><br>&#x201c;You know Gary was my high school boyfriend,&#x201d; I say carefully. &#x201c;You know he&#x2019;s the one who found me by the side of the road, after I&#x2019;d died but before I understood what the rules were. He drove me home.&#x201d; A thousand rides over the course of sixty years, and only one driver had ever been able to get me all the way home.&nbsp;<br><br>Then again, only one of the people who&#x2019;s ever picked me up has loved me. Maybe that&#x2019;s what made the difference.<br><br>&#x201c;A ride is not a wedding ring.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And a keychain is not a promise, but here we are.&#x201d; I offer her my best smile. It&#x2019;s contentment in a Sunday dress, and I hope she can see it for what it represents. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re good. We&#x2019;re figuring things out. Maybe in twenty years he&#x2019;ll decide to move on and go to an afterlife that lets him have hands again, or maybe we&#x2019;ll go there together, after we take down Bobby Cross. For right now, we&#x2019;re happy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, then, you give him my best, and if you need me to figure out how to make a diesel milkshake, I guess I&#x2019;ll buy another blender.&#x201d;<br><br>Emma&#x2019;s smile mirrors my own, and life&#x2014;life after death, anyway&#x2014;is good. Strange and impossible and difficult to describe as our existence is here on the other side of the sunlight, it&#x2019;s good.<br><br>* * * * *<br><br>Gary&#x2019;s engine roars to life when he sees me emerge from the diner, carrying the bag in one hand and my milkshake in the other. His headlights come on a second later, flashing a Morse code hello. I grin at him, still the besotted teenager who couldn&#x2019;t understand why one of the neatest boys in school would want anything to do with her.<br><br>&#x201c;Missed you too,&#x201d; I say.<br><br>The driver&#x2019;s side door swings open while I&#x2019;m still a few feet away. His control is getting better. He&#x2019;s learning his new body, its limitations and its possibilities. Not that long ago, he had trouble with anything bigger than his radio dial. By the time he finishes adjusting, I expect him to be able to do things no car should ever be able to do.<br><br></p></p><h2>Literary Paris: A Photographic Tour (Paris Photography Book, Books About Paris, Paris Coffee Table Book)</h2><p>An essential addition to the library of every booklover and Francophile, this unique love letter to Paris offers an immersive photographic stroll through its literary delights, from historic bookstores to hidden cafes. <em>Paris in Color</em> author Nichole Robertson turns her lens onto spots both legendary and little-known, highlighting quiet moments that every booklover savors&#x2014;inviting cafe scenes, comfy chairs, enticing book nooks&#x2014;and the weathered charm of places steeped in centuries of literary history.

In fact, she barely remembered the previous three weeks.<br><br>An ex-army officer, now a federal agent assigned to the Special Crimes Unit, Riley was a chameleon&#x2013;a clairvoyant who could blend in with her surroundings, be anyone or anything she chose to be. The SCU&#x2019;s expert on the occult, she&#x2019;d been sent to the beachfront cottage on Opal Island by her enigmatic chief, Noah Bishop, to investigate reports of dangerous occult activity.<br><br>But that was three weeks ago. Now she&#x2019;s awoken to discover that she&#x2019;s got a sexy new man in her life and an unreliable memory, and that the clairvoyant abilities she&#x2019;s always depended on to protect her are MIA. Worse yet, with SCU resources stretched thinner than ever before, Riley is alone and without backup, feeling her way through a deadly game of blindman&#x2019;s buff, where no one around her is quite who or what they seem. And a bizarre murder is only the first jarring reminder of how high the stakes really are.<br><br>Bishop wants Riley off the case. So does powerful local D.A. Ash Prescott. Both her old retired army buddy Gordon Skinner and Sheriff Jake Ballard believe she can catch a vicious killer. But one of these four men knows exactly what&#x2019;s going on in this coastal community, and that&#x2019;s knowledge Riley desperately needs. For what Riley can&#x2019;t remember is more than enough to cost her her life. This time evil isn&#x2019;t just closer than she thinks&#x2013;it&#x2019;s already there.</p></p><p>Kay Hooper, who has more than six million copies of her books in print worldwide, has won numerous awards and high praise for her novels. Kay lives in North Carolina, where she is currently working on her next novel.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>Even before she opened her eyes, Riley Crane was aware of two things. Her pounding head, and the smell of blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Neither was all that unusual.<br><br>Instinct and training made her lie perfectly still, eyes closed, until she was reasonably sure she was fully awake. She was on her stomach and probably on a bed, she thought. Possibly her own bed. On top of the covers, or at least not covered up. <br><br>Alone.<br><br>She opened her eyes a slit, just enough to see. Rumpled covers, pillows. Her rumpled covers and pillows, she decided. Her bed. The nightstand, holding the usual nightstand accessories of lamp, an untidy stack of books, and an alarm clock.<br><br>The red numbers announced that it was 2:00 p.m.<br><br>Okay, that <i>was</i> unusual. She never slept late, and she never took naps. Plus, while either a headache or the smell of blood was not uncommon in her life, the two together were setting off alarm bells in her mind.<br><br>Riley concentrated on listening, her unease growing when she realized that she could hear only on the "normal" level. The faint hum of the air-conditioning. The muffled rumble and crash of the surf out on the beach. A gull screaming as it flew past the house. The sort of stuff the usual everyday sense of hearing could glean automatically without any added concentration or focus.<br><br>But nothing else. Try as she might, she couldn't hear the underlying pulse of the house that was made up of things like the water in the plumbing and electricity humming in the lines and the all-but-imperceptible shifting and creaking of seemingly solid wood and stone as wind blew off the ocean and pressed against the building.<br><br>She couldn't hear any of it. And that was bad.<br><br>Taking the chance, Riley pushed herself up on her elbows and then slid her right hand underneath the pillows. Ahhh . . . at least it was there, right where it was supposed to be. Her hand closed over the reassuring grip of her weapon, and she pulled it out, giving it a quick visual scan.<br><br>Clip in, safety on, no round in the chamber. She automatically ejected the clip, checked that it was full, and slid it back into place, then chambered a round, the action quick and smooth after so many years of practice. The gun in her hand felt comfortable. That was right.<br><br>But something else was very wrong.<br><br>She could see the blood now as well as smell it. It was on her.<br><br>Riley rolled and sat up in a single motion, her gaze darting around the bedroom warily. Her bedroom, something she recognized with a sense of familiarity, the reassurance of being where she should be. And it was empty except for her.<br><br>Her head was pounding even harder from the quick movements, but she ignored it as she looked down at herself. The hand holding the gun was smeared with dried blood, and when she shifted the weapon to her other hand, she saw that it was as well. On her palms, on the backs of her hands, her forearms, even, she saw, underneath her fingernails.<br><br>As far as she could tell, there was no blood on the covers, the pillows. Which meant all the blood on her had dried before she had apparently fallen across the bed fully dressed and gone to sleep. Or passed out. Either way . . .<br><br>Jesus Christ.<br><br>Blood on her hands. Blood on her light-colored T-shirt. Blood on her faded jeans.<br><br>A lot of blood.<br><br>Was she hurt? She didn't feel any pain, apart from the throbbing headache. But she did feel a cold, growing fear, because waking up covered with blood could not, by any stretch of the imagination, possibly be a good thing.<br><br>She got herself off the bed, a little stiff and more than a little shaky, and moved on bare feet out of the bedroom. Quickly but cautiously, she checked her surroundings to reassure herself that she was alone, that no immediate threat existed here. The second bedroom was neat as a pin and looked as though it hadn't been used recently, which was probably the case; Riley seldom had the sort of guests that required an extra bedroom.<br><br>Checking out the remainder of the house was quick work, since most of it consisted of a large open area that was kitchen, dining area, and living room. Clean, but slightly untidy, with books, magazines, newspapers, CDs, and DVDs stacked here and there. The usual clutter of everyday life.<br><br>It looked like she'd been using the small dining table as a work surface, since place mats were pushed aside and her laptop carrying case was on one of the chairs. The computer wasn't out, which told her only that she probably hadn't been working on it recently.<br><br>The doors were closed and locked. The windows were also closed&#x2014;it was <i>hot</i> in summer along the South Carolina coast&#x2014;and locked.<br><br>She was alone.<br><br>Nevertheless, Riley took her weapon along when she went into her bathroom and checked behind the shower curtain before she locked herself in the relatively small room. Then she suffered another shock when she looked into the mirror above the vanity.<br><br>More dried blood was on her face, smeared across her cheek, and some appeared to be matted in her pale hair. Thickly matted.<br><br>"Shit."<br><br>Her stomach churned, and she stood there for a moment, eyes closed, until the nausea passed. Then she laid her weapon on the vanity and stripped to the skin.<br><br>She checked every inch of herself and found nothing. No injury, not even a scratch. It wasn't her blood.<br><br>That should have been reassuring. It wasn't. She was covered with blood, and it wasn't hers. Which left her with a hell of a lot of unsettling, potentially terrifying, questions.<br><br>What&#x2014;or who&#x2014;had bled all over her? What had happened? And why couldn't she remember?<br><br>Riley looked down at the crumpled clothing on the floor, then at herself, pale gold with her summer tan, her skin unmarked except for the dried blood on her hands and forearms.<br><br>Forearms. Somehow or other, she'd literally been up to her elbows in blood. Jesus.<br><br>Ignoring all the training that insisted she call the local authorities before doing another thing, Riley got into the shower. She made the water as hot as she could stand and used plenty of soap, scrubbing away the dried blood. She used a nailbrush to reach the dark slivers of dried blood underneath her fingernails and shampooed her short hair at least twice. Even after it was clean, after she was clean, she stood under the hot water, letting it beat against her shoulders, her neck, her still-sickly pounding head.<br><br><i>What had happened?</i><br><br>She didn't have the faintest clue, that was the hell of it. She had absolutely no memory of how she'd gotten herself covered with blood. <br><br>She remembered lots of other things. Almost all the important stuff, really. "Your name is Riley Crane," she muttered aloud, trying to reassure herself that something wasn't terribly wrong. "You're thirty-two years old, single, and a federal agent assigned, these last three years, to the Special Crimes Unit."<br><br>Name, rank, serial number&#x2014;more or less. Knowledge she was certain of.<br><br>No amnesia there. She knew who she was. An army brat with four older brothers, she'd grown up all over the world, had a rich and varied education, a wide range of training of a kind few women could claim, and had been able to take care of herself from a very young age. And she knew where she belonged, in the FBI, in the SCU. All that she remembered.<br><br>As for her recent life . . .<br><br>Christ, what <i>was </i>the last thing she remembered? She vaguely remembered renting the cottage, sort of remembered settling in. Carrying boxes and bags from the car. Putting things away. Walking on the beach. Sitting out on the deck in the darkness at night, feeling the warm ocean breeze on her face and&#x2014; <br><br>Not alone. Somebody out there with her. The vague, fuzzy memory of quiet voices. Hushed laughter. A touch she felt, for a fleeting second, so strongly that she looked down at her hand in bemusement.<br><br>And then it was gone.<br><br>Try as she might, Riley couldn't remember anything else clearly. It became a confusing jumble in her head. Just flashes, most of which made no sense to her. Faces that were unfamiliar, places she didn't remember being, random snatches of conversations she didn't understand. <br><br>Flashes punctuated by jabs of pain in her head.<br><br>Blaming the headache for the huge blank space that was her recent past, Riley got out of the shower and dried off. It was just the headache, of course. She'd swallow a few aspirin and get some food into her system, some caffeine into her veins, and then she'd remember. Surely. She wrapped a towel around her and, picking up her weapon again, returned to the bedroom to find fresh clothing.<br><br>It struck her, as she opened drawers and checked the closet, that she had been here awhile. She really was settled in, far more so than was her habit. This wasn't her usual living-out-of-a-suitcase jumble. Her clothing was fairly neat in the drawers, hanging in the closet. And it was more than beach vacation clothing.<br><br>Casual stuff, yes, but several dressy things as well, from nice slacks and silk blouses to dresses. Even heels and hose.<br><br>So, okay. She was here to work, that had to be it. The problem was, she couldn't seem to remember what the job was.<br><br>Riley opened one drawer and pulled out an extremely pretty, lacy, sexy bra-and-panty set, and felt her eyebrows rising. Not her usual stuff <i>at all</i>, obviously new, and there was more in the drawer. What the hell kind of job was she here to do, anyway?<br><br>That question echoed even stronger in her mind when she also discovered a garter belt.<br><br>A <i>garter belt,</i> for crying out loud.<br><br>"Jesus, Bishop, what've you got me doing this time?"<br><i>3 Years Previously</i><br><br>"I need somebody like you on my team." Noah Bishop, Chief of the FBI Special Crimes Unit, could be persuasive when he wanted to. And he definitely wanted to.<br><br>Riley Crane eyed him, her doubt and her wariness obvious. Knowing her background, he understood and had expected both.<br><br>She was interesting, he thought. Physically not at all what he'd expected: A bit below average height and petite, almost fragile in appearance, she didn't look as if she could throw a man more than twice her size over her shoulder with little apparent effort. Large gray eyes that were deceptively childlike, gazing innocently out of an elfin face that was quirky and intriguing and infinitely memorable without being in any way beautiful.<br><br>Fascinating that such a face belonged to a chameleon.<br><br>"Why me?" she demanded, straight to the point.<br><br>Bishop appreciated the directness, and answered matter-of-factly. "Aside from the necessary skills as an investigator, you possess two unique abilities I expect will prove highly useful in our work. You can fit yourself into any situation and be anyone you choose to be at any given time, and you're clairvoyant."<br><br>Riley didn't bother to protest. She merely said, "I like playing dress-up. Playing Let's Pretend. When you live in your imagination as a kid, you get good at stuff like that. As for the other, since I haven't gone out of my way to advertise&#x2014;just the opposite, in fact&#x2014;how did you find out?"<br><br>"I keep my ear to the ground," Bishop replied with a shrug.<br><br>"Not good enough."<br><br>"I'm building a unit around agents with paranormal abilities, and I've spent a great deal of time these last few years . . . casting out lines. Quietly alerting people I trust, within law enforcement and outside it, as to the sort of potential agents I'm looking for."<br><br>"Psychics."<br><br>"Not just any psychics. I need exceptionally strong people who can handle both their abilities and the emotional and psychological hardships of the work we do." He nodded to the scene just past her. "It seems fairly obvious that you can handle the sort of extreme stress I'm talking about."<br><br>Riley glanced back over her shoulder, where the rest of her team was working in the rubble of what might or might not have been a deliberate explosion. The victims had been located and carried&#x2014;on stretchers or in body bags&#x2014;from the scene hours ago; now the army investigators were searching for evidence.<br><br>"I haven't been doing this particular sort of thing for long," Riley said. "I tend toward investigative work, sure, but my last job dealt with base security. I go wherever I'm sent."<br><br>"So your CO told me."<br><br>"You spoke to him?"<br><br>Bishop hesitated only long enough to make it obvious, then said, "He's the one who got in touch with me."<br><br>"So he's one of those trusted people you mentioned?"<br><br>"He is. The friend of a friend, more or less. And open-minded to the possibilities of the paranormal, a trait not terribly common in the military. No offense intended, obviously."<br><br>"None taken. Obviously. What did he tell you?"<br><br>"He seems to feel that your talents are being wasted and that he can't offer you the kind of challenges he believes you need."<br><br>"He said that?"<br><br>"Words to the effect. You're on short time, I take it, with a few weeks left before you re-up. Or not."<br><br>"I'm career military," she said.<br><br>"Or not," Bishop said.<br><br>Riley shook her head slightly, and said, "Offhand, Agent Bishop, I can't think of a single reason why I'd want to exchange the military life for one with the FBI&#x2014;however <i>specialized</i> your unit is. Besides, even if I do get an occasional hunch, it never makes a difference in the outcome of any given situation."<br><br>"Doesn't it?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"We can help you learn how to channel and focus your abilities, how to use them constructively. You might be surprised at just how much of a difference that can make&#x2014;in any given situation."<br><br>Without waiting for a response from her, Bishop opened the briefcase he carried and extracted a large, thick manila envelope. "Take a look at this when you get the chance," he said, handing it to her. "Tonight, tomorrow. After that, if you're interested, give me a call. My number's inside."<br><br>"And if I'm not interested?"<br><br>"Everything in there is a copy. If you're not interested, destroy it and forget about it. But I'm betting you'll be interested. So I'll stick around for a few days, Major. Just in case."<br><br>Riley stood gazing after him for a long moment, tapping the envelope against her hand thoughtfully. Then she locked it in her vehicle and got back to work.<br><br>It wasn't until much later that evening, alone in her small off-base apartment, that she discovered Bishop hadn't been entirely truthful. One thing in the envelope wasn't a copy.<br><br>She had half-consciously steeled herself before opening the envelope, partly because common sense told her the sort of thing she was likely to find and partly because her extra sense was tingling a warning as well&#x2014;and had been from the moment she'd first touched it. But years of disciplined living, particularly in the military, had taught her a fair amount about concentration and focus, so that she was usually able to damp down those distracting feelings until she needed them. <br><br>Until she was ready to focus on what she saw when she upended the envelope onto her desk.<br><br>Copies, yeah. Copies of hell. Autopsy reports&#x2014;and autopsy photos.

Tracing this process to the origins of the Arabic language, rather than the advent of Islam, Tim Mackintosh-Smith begins his narrative more than a thousand years before Muhammad and focuses on how Arabic, both spoken and written, has functioned as a vital source of shared cultural identity over the millennia.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mackintosh-Smith reveals how linguistic developments&#x2014;from pre-Islamic poetry to the growth of script, Muhammad&#x2019;s use of writing, and the later problems of printing Arabic&#x2014;have helped and hindered the progress of Arab history, and investigates how, even in today&#x2019;s politically fractured post&#x2013;Arab Spring environment, Arabic itself is still a source of unity and disunity.</p><p>This kaleidoscopic study covers almost 3,000 years of Arab history, and reveals how Arabic has played a vital role in helping and hindering the progress of Arab history, and how even today the language itself is still a source of unity and disunity.<b>Tim Mackintosh-Smith</b> is an eminent Arabist, translator, and traveler whose previous publications include <i>Travels with a Tangerine </i>and <i>Yemen</i><i>.</i> He has lived in the Arab world for thirty-five years and is a senior fellow of the Library of Arabic Literature.</p><h2>You&#39;re on an Airplane: A Self-Mythologizing Memoir</h2><p><b>A National Bestseller<br><br>Have you ever wondered what it would be like talk to Parker Posey?

That's okay, I'll just smush them both under the seat and once we're in the air I'll take one out and use it as an ottoman. I sit cross-legged so Gracie can be on my lap once we're off, but thank you. She is, actually. My boyfriend at the time, Ryan, his grandmother had just died and they'd watch the Burns and Allen show together when he was a kid. I wanted a name that could evoke a quality because I knew I'd be repeating it. I didn't want to name her Snickers or something. "Something! Come here!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sat next to a dog and its owner at the Union Square dog run once, and the dog had on a collar that spelled "bow wow" in separated silver lettering that slid and turned and the "bow" part was under the dog's neck. I said to the owner, "I can't believe you named your dog 'Mom,'" and he was like, "It spells 'bow wow.'" I told him that I was joking and then it got awkward, because he seemed to be sad or depressed. These are strange times; maybe naming your dog "Mom" isn't so odd. It seems like everyone is feeling lonely, in some way-left out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'm working on a book, actually. It's about me. It's okay, Gracie. She's on a doggie downer. She'll be okay once the plane takes off and the slamming doors stop. They bang no matter how you close them, like they were made to slam. Yeah, I like those movies, too. Best in Show's a classic. You'll hear more about it. Yes, she's an emotional support dog, so she can be in my lap. I have the papers under the seat in front of me, if you need me to reach down there to get them. Seltzer with ice, please. No, I'm good, no lime; don't bother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It used to be so different, flying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, a book! I realized it was time. There were stories to share that my friends were entertained by, so I thought, you know, tell them. Thereï¿½s also a literary agent who lives in my neighborhood, whose partner art-directed Party Girl. I started feeling guilty when Iï¿½d see him, because heï¿½d say, ï¿½I know thereï¿½s a book in you.ï¿½ So I went into a sort of labor and produced a sort of baby, where instead of being human itï¿½s a bound object made of paper called ï¿½pagesï¿½ with words on it. You bring it to life and make it talk. Just donï¿½t leave it alone for too long or it will start crying. It will feel weird at first but youï¿½ll get used to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can you hear Gracie snoring? Her little body vibrates when she does. I use my Southern accent when I talk to Gracie because she's just too sweet. Being number one on the tarmac is so winning and such an honor, so thrilling. I got interested in acting because I was born into it-born into turbulence. It's kind of simple: I'm a character actor because I come from a family of characters. When people ask if anyone in my family is an actor, I say all of them. They're performative people. They'll star somewhat in this, in the way Mother and Father star in our lives, constantly-as constant as the northern star-but I'll take the lead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When my dad and I fought, he'd send me to my room to write him a letter. He wasn't good at expressing his feelings when he was angry, he was better at letter writing, and since he was an adult and I was just a child, he won. He was passionate and knew how to pull heartstrings. We'd joke in our family that he was the puppeteer and he'd splay his hand wide, moving it slowly from side to side, as if to control the strings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We'll be in the air soon and closer to the real stars, which make the constellations, which branched the first stories from the heavens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My book is called You're on an Airplane. It's a memoir pronounced with the emphasis on "me." Think of it like an actor who was cornered into writing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Flying can be nice, once you're in the air. Don't you wish we could be here forever and never have to land?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To Perform</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had to wear this turban and these glasses, too-all this clackety-clack on my wrists and around my neck; it helps to dress up when you're flying. I'm somewhat Norma Desmond, from Sunset Boulevard, today, but it won't be for the entire flight, I promise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Taxi! I mean, flight attendant! Hi, can I have a scotch, neat?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Norma Desmond, the fading silent-film star who bemoaned the advent of "talkies," was portrayed by the inimitable Gloria Swanson, first clotheshorse and woman of indomitable spirit. You've seen it? So you know that she wore a turban in the film and said things like "I am big. It's the pictures that got small." Now look how small the pictures have gotten on these freaking smartphone screens. The tiny screens have gotten into people's hands, and there's all this swiping going on, all this shoo-fly bullshit. In the nineties, we had big screens in the cinema and big TVs in our homes. It boggles the mind that people can walk around with small televisions in their pockets and use them as telephones. I saw a baby in a stroller on an iPhone just the other day, on the sidewalks of Manhattan. Now, tell me: Who was that baby texting?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Are you on Facebook? It's wonderful that people have their Facebook friends but I don't have Facebook "friends" because I'm not on it. I want to read people's faces in present-time reality-and how could they be a book? It's presumptuous and absurd. I went on someone's Facebook once (now, that just sounds crude) and what I really wanted was proof that these are real people, but there is no proof because I wasn't there. I wasn't on the vacation, at the graduation, at the spring break party. I wasn't there for the birth of the baby or for all those salads. It should be called "Scrapbookface," that's more apropos. There was a movie made about that guy who invented it? Mark Zuckerberg, right, thank you. I never saw it but I did go to the premiere to mingle in the lobby of the theater and to social-network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, my Instagram followers say not to join because it's a rabbit hole, and I trust them. Is this how I grow old? Saying things like "my followers," like a cult leader, and going on about turbans? Looks like it!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Headwear feels right, especially after you reach your mid-forties and start to see the older person you'll become. Would you like a brush? Eye drops? Oh my God, that feels good. Care to slather your face with moisturizer? You have pretty hair, young lady. Don't fall asleep; I want you to listen. Turbans apply to the men out there as well, who will become older ladies as they soften with age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's kind of fun getting older and giving advice, calling young people "dear," and talking to myself in public, not caring who hears me. Uttering sentences that come out as extraneous sounds and feeling no need to explain myself in words because a facial expression will do. It's "Perimenopausal Time," which to me sounds like an adorable (maybe not) puppet troupe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here, let me put a turban on you; I travel with scarves, wraps, and throws. Press your finger on the fabric at the top of your forehead, where your hairline starts, and hold. I'll wrap you up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It feels good to have something on your head that makes you feel like a witch or a genie, doesn't it? Let's get some magic back. Do you have a lover? You don't have to tell me if you do or don't, but if you do, they'll dig this. After you get out of the bath together and make breakfast, like dry toast with a poached egg and a side of cantaloupe. "Come here so I can look you in the eyes," you'll hear. "We're all multidimensional beings, babe, because everyone is a time traveler, if only for a moment. . . ." And then, maybe, "Are you upset about something? Do you need any help with anything?" Who knows what'll happen after that. One thing's for certain: your hair will dry and you'll go to work, where you can get wrapped up again, caught up in the picture of the vacation you weren't invited to join, and maybe you'll text that little baby back. You can shoo-fly your phone till the cows come home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don't you feel better now that you know your head won't fly off your body? Give me a headdress and a magic carpet, please. Why this diminishing of the feminine? Why is it still happening? I know it's been like this for a long while now-since we stopped worshipping the sun and the moon-but it feels like we should be beyond that. Sun and moon: good and evil-blah, blah, blah. It's All One. Will you press right here? Right between my thumb and forefinger? Yes, that's where my headache is. Did you know that the Hollywood system of storytelling quadruples, for men, as they age? I read that somewhere. I guess it's because the men are rarely home in those movies because the women don't want machine guns or aliens in the house.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I must've dozed off when you were pressing my hand like that. I had a dream I was running a marathon and staying in Matt Damon's home in the wilderness. He lived there whenever there was a marathon. No, wait, I wasn't running, I was on the side of the road walking to Matt Damon's. We shared some eroticism and I noticed glitter all over his bedsheets. He said he'd gotten divorced and I wondered why because I'd heard his wife was so lovely. Then I saw a little movie, like a commercial, in my mind: Strange Christmas decorations appeared and dissolved-an icicle plaque with "The Damons" written on it, and then a fire poker with children's names on it. Dinner was being served and the clang of silverware turned to Christmas. I don't like Christmas; it's too much of a production and I've already done too many. I do love Jesus, though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was staying in Hollywood, at Chris Kattanï¿½s house, and I was crying. This was not a dream; this was real. Chris is like a brother to me. I was sitting outside, on the stone steps Danny DeVito brought back from Big Sur or somewhere-Danny and Rhea Perlman owned the house before Chris bought it. Rhea had her dance studio in the bedroom where I slept. Anyway, I was on the phone with my manager at the time, and I was freaking out that I didnï¿½t have a job. To encourage me, he said, ï¿½Look at Jeremy Renner,ï¿½ who he also represented. ï¿½He didnï¿½t start getting work until his forties.ï¿½ And I said, ï¿½I know, but heï¿½s a man. Iï¿½m not a man.ï¿½</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was a lull in the conversation, because I had a real point. I could hear my manager sense that I'd become too aware to be handled and coerced into delusion. Actors actually pay their agents and managers not only to negotiate contracts but also to encourage fantasies and help conjure them, which is what I think delusion is. It's why I still love every agent I've ever had. Look how cozy that salad is in its little bowl.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, my manager knew I wasn't having it anymore, and that I'd had it. It's possible that, somewhere in there, I'd remembered "not being available" to meet for one of those early action films with Matt Damon. It could've been the beginning of The Bourne Identity. I simply wasn't prepared to be scared in a car for a few months, even with Matt's daemon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was an Anaconda movie, too, that</p><p>I turned down because I didn't want to wrestle with snakes or be in wet clothes while at work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever I get to the point of exasperation, I like to say, "I feel like my head has flown off of my body," or, "Where is the man who would want to put his hands on my head?" I will say that Jeremy Winner is a wonderful hugger because we were at Sundance and he gave me a really nice hug. I didn't get to the point of having him place his hands on my head, but I'm almost certain he would've if I'd asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Iï¿½ve maintained a career and I love to act, but I think every job is my last. And when I start the job, I forget that I know how to do it and by the time I find out that I do, Iï¿½m done. Iï¿½m always thinking of other jobs I could do instead, but maybe those are just characters I want to play. Iï¿½m not great at being a movie star; itï¿½s either too boring or too much work. Iï¿½ve had too much therapy, I think.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My career took shape organically (farm to table), when the culture supported independent films and I didn't have to feel like a movie star if I didn't want to. The independent film world in the early nineties had a real independence from the Hollywood system, like it did in the seventies (as well as in my early silent-film work with auteurs like Cecil B. DeMille). And then, Time called me the queen of independent cinema and that's when my career in independent cinema virtually ended. Oh my God, this cough!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don't like games. I wasn't, and I'm still not, good at them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They make me uncomfortable, even board games, and especially charades. I do like puzzles and an intimate in-house karaoke party. Singing is not a game. I do love The Voice. I make a really good cup of coffee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was a little girl, my dad would recite Emily Dickinsonï¿½s ï¿½Iï¿½m nobody! Who are you? / Are you nobody, too? / Then thereï¿½s a pair of us-donï¿½t tell! / Theyï¿½d banish us, you know.ï¿½ Heï¿½s an entertainer and fighter by nature: a star in his own life. My mother comes to life through the lens of my father but holds her own, naturally. I obviously came to life from my mother. They were movie stars in my eyes-fabulous Southern characters. So my own character, what could be a fragmentation of selves, finds a wholeness in performing many different parts and finds recognition in others of similar makeup. The arts and show business are full of these people.</p></p><h2>Critique and Crises: Enlightenment and the Pathogenesis of Modern Society (Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought)</h2><p><p><i>Critique and Crisis</i> established Reinhart Koselleck's reputation as the most important German intellectual historian of the postwar period. This first English translation of Koselleck's tour de force demonstrates a chronological breadth, a philosophical depth, and an originality which are hardly equalled in any scholarly domain. It is a history of the Enlightenment in miniature, fundamental to our understanding of that period and its consequences. Like Tocqueville, Koselleck views Enlightenment intellectuals as an uprooted, unrealistic group of onlookers who sowed the seeds of the modern political tensions that first flowered in the French Revolution. He argues that it was the split that developed between state and society during the Enlightenment that fostered the emergence of this intellectual elite divorced from the realities of politics. Koselleck describes how this disjunction between political authority proper and its subjects led to private spheres that later became centers of moral authority and, eventually, models for political society that took little or no notice of the constraints under which politicians must inevitably work. In this way progressive bourgeois philosophy, which seemed to offer the promise of a unified and peaceful world, in fact produced just the opposite. The book provides a wealth of examples drawn from all of Europe to illustrate the still relevant message that we evade the constraints and the necessities of the political realm at our own risk.</p><p>Critique and Crisis is included in the series Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought, edited by Thomas McCarthy.</p></p><p>Reinhart Koselleck is Professor of the Theory of History at the University of Bielefeld and author of <i>Futures Past: On the Semantics of Historical Time.</i>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Murder in the Ball Park (The Nero Wolfe Mysteries)</h2><p><b>A killer hiding among the crowd at a Dodgers-Giants game forces Nero Wolfe to step up to the plate in this &#x201c;superb&#x201d; mystery (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review).</b><br> Archie Goodwin and Saul Panzer have ventured into the wilds of northern Manhattan to watch the Giants take on the Dodgers at the Polo Grounds. The national anthem is just winding down when Panzer spies a notable in the box seats: state senator Orson Milbank, a silver-haired scoundrel with enemies in every corner of upstate New York. In the fourth inning, a monstrous line drive brings every fan in the grandstand to his feet&#x2014;every fan save for one silver-haired senator, who has been shot dead by a sniper in the upper deck.<br> Archie&#x2019;s employer&#x2014;the rotund genius Nero Wolfe&#x2014;has no interest in investigating the stadium slaying, but Archie is swayed by the senator&#x2019;s suspiciously lovely widow. Her husband was mired hip-deep in corruption, and sorting out who killed him will be a task far less pleasant than an afternoon at the ball park.&nbsp;</p><p><b>A politician is murdered by a sniper during a baseball game and his widow hires detectives Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin to solve the case.&nbsp;</b>Robert Goldsborough (b. 1937) is an American author best known for continuing Rex Stout&#x2019;s famous Nero Wolfe series. Born in Chicago, he attended Northwestern University and upon graduation went to work for the Associated Press, beginning a lifelong career in journalism that would include long periods at the&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Advertising Age</i>.<br> While at the&nbsp;<i>Tribune</i>, Goldsborough began writing mysteries in the voice of Rex Stout, the creator of iconic sleuths Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. Goldsborough&#x2019;s first novel starring Wolfe,&nbsp;<i>Murder in E Minor</i>&nbsp;(1986), was met with acclaim from both critics and devoted fans, winning a Nero Award from the Wolfe Pack. Nine more Wolfe mysteries followed, including&nbsp;<i>Death on Deadline&nbsp;</i>(1987) and&nbsp;<i>Fade to Black</i>&nbsp;(1990). His most recent book is&nbsp;<i>Archie in the Crosshairs&nbsp;</i>(2015).</p><h2>Triumph of the Darksword</h2><p><b>Volume III in the heroic saga of magic, betrayal and adventure, The Darksword Trilogy.</b><br><br>In the realm where magic <i>is </i>life, Joram was one of the Dead. Born without power, he was denies his royal birthright and sentenced to the <i>Turning</i>&#x2014;his mind to be imprisoned inside a husk of living stone.<br><br>Yet at the last moment, Saryon took his place, suffering the eternal torment for his young master, And joram and his wife Gwendolyn vanished into the mists that marked the Border of the World. . . .&nbsp;<br><br>Now, ten years later, Joram and Gwendolyn have returned to reclaim their rightful place in Merilon. Wielding one last time the terrible, magic-thirsting Darksword, Joram must confront the evil sorcerer Menju and his army of Technologists from beyond the Border in a final apocalyptic battle.<br><br>Rejoined by Saryon, the mage Mosiah and Simkin, Joram will fulfill the ancient prophecy of the Darksword&#x2014;the prophecy that puts in his hands the power to destroy the world . . . or save it.</p><p>The Watchers had guarded the Border of Thimhallan for centuries. It was their enforced task, through sleepless night and dreary day, to keep watch along the boundary that separated the magical realm from whatever lay Beyond.<br> &nbsp;<br> What did lie Beyond?<br> &nbsp;<br> The ancients knew. They had come to this world, fleeing a homeland where they were no longer wanted, and they knew what lay on the other side of those shifting mists. To protect themselves from it, they encompassed their world in a magical barrier, decreeing that the Watchers be placed on its Border&#x2014;eternal, sleepless guards. But now it was forgotten. The tides of centuries had worn away the memory. If there was a threat from beyond the Border, no one worried about it, for how could it pass the magic barrier?<br> &nbsp;<br> The Watchers kept their silent vigil still&#x2014;they had no choice. And when the mists parted for the first time in centuries, when a figure stepped out of the shifting gray fog and put his foot upon the sand, the Watchers were appalled and cried out their warning.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there were none, now, who knew how to listen to words of stone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thus the man&#x2019;s return was unheralded, unannounced. He had gone forth in silence and in silence he returned. The Watchers shrieked, &#x201c;Beware, Thimhallan! Your doom has come! The Border has been crossed!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But no one heard them.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were those who might have heard the silent cries, had they been attentive. Bishop Vanya, for one. He was the highest ranking catalyst in the land and, as such, it seemed likely that his god, the Almin, would have called His minister&#x2019;s attention to such a calamity. But it was dinner time. His Holiness was entertaining guests and, though the Bishop prayed beautifully and devoutly over the meal, everyone had the distinct feeling that the Almin really hadn&#x2019;t been invited.<br> &nbsp;<br> Prince Xavier should have heard the warnings of the stone Watchers. He was a warlock, after all&#x2014;DKarn-duuk, a War Master, and one of the most powerful magi in the land. But he had more important matters to consider. Prince Xavier&#x2014;pardon, Emperor Xavier&#x2014;was preparing for war with the kingdom of Sharakan and there was only one thing more important to him than that. Or rather, it was all tied together. How to retrieve the Darksword, held fast in the arms of a stone statue. If he possessed this powerful sword&#x2014;a weapon that could absorb magic&#x2014;Sharakan must fall to his might.<br> &nbsp;<br> And so Bishop Vanya sat in his elegant chambers at the top of the mountain fastness of the Font, dining on boar&#x2019;s head and piglet tails and pickled shrimp, discussing the nature and habits of marsupials with his guests, and the warnings of the Watchers were swallowed up with the wine.<br> &nbsp;<br> Prince Xavier paced about his laboratory, occasionally darting over to read the text in some musty, brittle-paged book, consider it, then shake his head with a bitter snarl. The warnings of the Watchers were lost in his curses.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only one person in all of Thimhallan heard the warnings. In the city of Sharakan, a bearded young man dressed in purple hose, pink pantaloons, and a bright red silken waistcoat, was wakened from his afternoon nap. Cocking his head toward the east, he cried out irritably, &#x201c;E&#x2019;gad! How do you expect a fellow to get any sleep? Stop that fearful racket!&#x201d; With a wave of his hand, he slammed shut the window.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beware, Thimhallan! Your doom has come! The Border has been crossed!<br> &nbsp;<br> The man who stepped out of the mists was in his late twenties, though he appeared older. His body was that of a young man&#x2014;strong, muscular, firm, and upright. His face was the face of a man whose sufferings might have spanned a century.<br> &nbsp;<br> Framed by thick black hair, the face was handsome, stern, and&#x2014;at first glance&#x2014;appeared as cold and unfeeling as the stone faces of those who watched him. Lines of care and of grief had been chiseled into that face by a Master&#x2019;s hand, however. The fires of anger and hatred that had once burned in the brown eyes had died out, leaving behind cold ash.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man was dressed in long white robes of fine wool, covered by a wet, mud-stained traveling cloak. Standing upon the sand, he looked about him with the slow and deliberate gaze of one who looks about the home he has not seen in many, many years. The expression of sadness and of sorrow on his face did not change, except to grow deeper. Turning, he reached back into the mists. A hand took hold of his, and a woman with long, golden hair stepped out of the shifting gray fog to stand beside him.<br> &nbsp;<br> She glanced about her with a dazed air, blinking her eyes in the rays of the setting sun that stared at them from behind distant mountains&#x2014;its red, unblinking eye seeming to regard them with amazement.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where am I?&#x201d; the woman asked calmly, as if they had walked down a street and taken a wrong turn.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thimhallan,&#x201d; the man replied in an even tone of voice that spread like salve over some deep wound.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do I know this place?&#x201d; the woman questioned. And though the man replied and she accepted his answers, she did not look at him or appear to be talking to him but continually sought out and spoke to an unseen companion.<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman was younger than the man, about twenty-seven. The golden hair, parted in the center of her head, was tied loosely in two thick braids that hung down to her waist. The braids gave her a childish look, making her seem younger than her years. Her pretty blue eyes enhanced this childish appearance as well&#x2014;until one looked into them closely. Then it could be seen that their eerie brilliance and wide-open stare were not expressive of the innocent wonder of childhood. This woman&#x2019;s eyes saw things that could not be seen by others.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You were born here,&#x201d; the man said quietly. &#x201c;You were raised in this world, as was I.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s odd,&#x201d; said the woman. &#x201c;I would think I&#x2019;d remember.&#x201d; Like the man&#x2019;s, her cloak was splattered with mud and wet through. Her hair, too, was wet, as was his, and clung damply to her cheeks. Both were weary and appeared to have traveled a long distance through a soaking rainstorm.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where are my friends?&#x201d; she asked, half-turning and staring behind them into the mists. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t they coming?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; the man said in the same calm tones. &#x201c;They cannot cross the Border. But you will find new friends here. Give them time. They are probably not accustomed to you yet. No one in this land has talked with them in a long, long while.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, really?&#x201d; The woman brightened. Then her face grew shadowed. &#x201c;How lonely they must be.&#x201d; Lifting her hand to her forehead to block out the beaming rays of the sun, she peered up and down the sandy shore. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; she called, holding out her other hand as she might to a wary cat. &#x201c;Please, its all right. Don&#x2019;t be frightened. You can come to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Leaving the woman talking to the empty air, the man&#x2014;with a profound sigh&#x2014;walked up to the stone statue of the catalyst; the statue that held the sword in its rock hands.<br> &nbsp;<br> As he stared at the statue in silence, a tear crept from one of his clear, brown eyes, disappearing into the deep lines that cut into the stern, clean-shaven face. Its mate slid down the other cheek, falling in the thick, black hair that curled upon the man&#x2019;s shoulders. Drawing a deep, shuddering breath, the man reached out his hand and gently caught hold of the orange silk banner&#x2014;now tattered and torn&#x2014;that fluttered bravely in the winds. Taking it from the statue, he smoothed the silk in his hands, then folded it and placed it carefully in a pocket of the long, white robes he wore. His slender fingers reached out to stroke the statues careworn face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My friend,&#x201d; he whispered, &#x201c;do you know me? I have changed from the boy you knew, the boy whose wretched soul you saved.&#x201d; His hand pressed against the cool rock. &#x201c;Yes, Saryon,&#x201d; he murmured, &#x201c;you know me. I feel it between us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He smiled, a half-smile. This smile was not bitter, as his smiles once had been. This smile was sad and filled with regret. &#x201c;Our situations are reversed, Father. Once I was cold as stone, warmed by your love and compassion. Now it is you whose flesh is icy to my touch. If only my love&#x2014;learned too late&#x2014;could warm you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He bowed his head, overcome by grief, and his teardimmed gaze fell upon the statues hands that held the sword in their stone grip.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; he muttered.<br> &nbsp;<br> Examining the statue&#x2019;s hands more closely, the man saw that the stone flesh of the palms on which the sword rested was cracked and gouged as though it had been struck by hammer and chisel. Several of the stone fingers were broken and twisted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They tried to take the sword!&#x201d; he realized &#x201c;And you would not give it up!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Stroking the statues injured hands with his own, he felt the anger that he thought was dead flickering to life within him once more. &#x201c;What suffering you must have endured! And they knew it! You stood there, helpless, while they gouged your flesh and broke your bones! They knew you would feel every blow, yet they didn&#x2019;t care Why should they?&#x201d; he questioned bitterly. &#x201c;They couldn&#x2019;t hear your cries!&#x201d; The man&#x2019;s own hands went to the weapon, touching it haltingly. Reflexively, his hand closed over the hilt of the stone sword. &#x201c;I have come upon a fool&#x2019;s errand it seems&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The man stopped speaking abruptly He felt the sword move! Thinking he might have imagined it in his anger, he gave the stone weapon a tug, as though to draw it out of its rock scabbard. To his amazement, the sword slid out easily, he nearly dropped it in surprise. Holding it, he felt the cold stone warm at his touch and, as he watched, astonished, the rock turned to metal.</p><h2>Sinful: A Bitter Creek Novel</h2><p><b>For readers of Linda Lael Miller and Susan Mallery comes <i>New</i> <i>York Times</i> bestselling author Joan Johnston&#x2019;s sizzling contemporary Western romance, where power, money, and rivalries rule&#x2014;and love is the best revenge.</b><br><br> WHILE HE SEEKS A HAVEN,<br> SHE SEARCHES FOR A PLACE TO CALL HOME<br><br> After a tragic accident leaves Delta sergeant Connor Flynn a widower, he faces the toughest fight of his life: battling his in-laws for custody of his two young children.

She is currently a full-time writer living in Colorado.<p>Chapter 1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her name was Eve. Not Evelyn or Eveline or Evette. Just Eve. The day she was born, her father, King Grayhawk, took one look at her large blue eyes, soft blond curls, and bowed upper lip and whispered, &#x201c;Eve.&#x201d; Apparently, she reminded him of some woman he&#x2019;d fallen in love with as a younger man. That Eve, he&#x2019;d declared, was the only woman he had ever loved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those words, spoken as her mother lay recovering from labor, must have been the final insult, because Eve was still a babe in arms when her mom ran off with one of King&#x2019;s cowhands. Eve had grown up with the knowledge that her birth had caused a terrible rift between her parents. That marital fracture had left her and her fraternal twin sisters, Taylor and Victoria, and their older stepsister, Leah, as motherless children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve felt burdened by her name. It didn&#x2019;t help that she shared it with the woman who&#x2019;d tempted Adam to sin in the Garden of Eden. In high school she was teased and taunted as she began to acquire seductive curves. She was sure one of those pain-in-the-butt Flynn brothers had started it, but the other boys had quickly followed his lead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Show me an apple, and I&#x2019;ll eat it,&#x201d; a boy would say, &#x201c;so long as you come along with it, Eve.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;Too bad you ate that apple, Eve, or we&#x2019;d all still be running around naked,&#x201d; followed by a lurid grin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She&#x2019;d gotten pretty good at sending back zingers like, &#x201c;If God had seen you naked, Buck, He might have decided He made a real mistake only taking out a rib.&#x201d; But the constant innuendo made Eve&#x2019;s teenage life miserable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was the least of the trouble those four awful Flynn brothers&#x2014;Aiden, Brian, Connor, and Devon&#x2014;had caused her and her sisters over the years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From her father&#x2019;s rants at supper, Eve had known he was feuding with Angus Flynn. It wasn&#x2019;t until she was eight years old that she understood why. Angus&#x2019;s older sister, Jane, had been King&#x2019;s first wife, and Angus blamed King for his unhappy sister&#x2019;s death from an overdose of barbiturates. Eve had no idea whether her father was innocent or not, but he was sorely tried by Angus&#x2019;s efforts to blight his life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The animosity should have remained between their fathers, but it had bled onto their children. Angus Flynn&#x2019;s four sons were infamous around Jackson Hole for wreaking havoc and causing mischief. After their aunt Jane died, as though a switch had been flipped, the Flynn brothers began aiming all that tomfoolery toward Eve and her sisters. It didn&#x2019;t take long before King&#x2019;s Brats, who&#x2019;d done their own share of troublemaking around Jackson Hole, were giving as good as they got from those wild Flynn boys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve could remember vividly the year fourteen-year-old Leah&#x2019;s blueberry pie had been mysteriously doused with salt at the Four-H competition. Her stepsister had retaliated by shaving the flank of fourteen-year-old Aiden&#x2019;s Four-H calf so it looked like it had the mange.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the mischief she and her sisters perpetrated was merely a nuisance. Like putting an ad in the paper for a cattle auction at the Flynn ranch, the Lucky 7, beginning at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. on a Saturday morning, offering their prize bull for sale, when no such auction existed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve had helped Taylor and Victoria punch a tiny hole in the gas tank of Brian&#x2019;s truck, so that when he and Devon headed off to hunt deer in the mountains, where there was no cell phone reception, they&#x2019;d ended up making a long, bitterly cold walk back to civilization.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Flynns had retaliated by placing slices of bologna in a vulgar design on the hood of Taylor and Victoria&#x2019;s cherry-red Jeep Laredo. The next morning, when her sisters pulled the deli meat off the hood, the preservatives in the bologna caused the top layer of paint to come off as well, leaving the distinct imprint of male genitalia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It wouldn&#x2019;t have been so bad if the pranks had remained physically harmless. They hadn&#x2019;t. When Eve was a freshman in high school, the cinch of her saddle had been cut before a barrel race at a local rodeo, and she&#x2019;d broken her arm when the saddle broke free. Eve could remember how enraged Leah was in the moments before the ambulance carted her away. The Flynn boys were competing at the same rodeo in calf roping. They should have known to check their cinches, but Eve supposed they hadn&#x2019;t expected Leah to retaliate so quickly. When Aiden roped a calf his cinch broke&#x2014;along with his leg.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The mischief escalated into attacks involving other people. Taylor&#x2019;s and Victoria&#x2019;s prom dates were kidnapped by a couple of boys wearing hoods, who tied them to a tree so they never showed up. The twins were devastated. The fallout afterward was even worse. The kidnapped boys made it clear that it wasn&#x2019;t worth the trouble to date a Grayhawk when it meant putting up with all the horseshit being shoveled by those crazy Flynn boys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since Eve had lived in the same small town her whole life, the &#x201c;harmless&#x201d; high school prank involving her name had been a continuing source of irritation. Most of the kids who&#x2019;d gone to high school with her still lived in Jackson, and there was always some jerk who couldn&#x2019;t resist prodding her, hoping to get under her skin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve wasn&#x2019;t looking to hook up or make waves. All she wanted to do was sit at the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar on the square in Jackson, along with the tourists who&#x2019;d come to enjoy the last of the black-diamond ski season on the Grand Tetons, review the digital photographs she&#x2019;d taken that day of the herd of wild mustangs she&#x2019;d rescued, and enjoy her martini.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that an <i>apple</i> martini, Eve?&#x201d; a man called from behind her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve turned to find Buck Madison, the former Jackson Broncs quarterback, grinning like an idiot at one of the pool tables in the center of the bar. Two of his former teammates stood shoulder to shoulder with him, giggling like teenage girls. All three were obviously drunk. She purposefully turned her attention back to the digital shot of the only colt in her herd. With any luck, Buck would give up and shut up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve smiled as she studied the image of Midnight frolicking with his mother, his black mane and tail flying, his back arched, and all four hooves off the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You look good enough to tempt a man to sin, <i>Eve.</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Buck&#x2019;s voice was loud in a bar that had suddenly become quiet. Eve shut off her camera and laid it on the bar as she dismounted the Western saddle on a stand&#x2014;complete with stirrups&#x2014;that served as a bar stool. She glanced at Buck in the mirror over the bar as she gathered her North Face fleece from where it hung off the saddle horn. She wasn&#x2019;t going to get into a war of words with a drunk. It was a lose-lose proposition. She had one arm through her fleece when Buck stripped it back off, dangling it from his forefinger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, uh, uh,&#x201d; he said, wagging the finger holding the fleece. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not done looking yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She turned to confront Buck, her chin upthrust, her blue eyes shooting daggers of disdain. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m done being ogled. Give me my coat.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She held out her hand and waited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She felt a wave of resentment toward the Flynns, who&#x2019;d started that whole Garden of Eden business in the first place. She couldn&#x2019;t help the fact that she&#x2019;d developed a lush female figure in high school. At twenty-six, she&#x2019;d made peace with her body. There was no easy way to conceal her curves, so she didn&#x2019;t try. But she did nothing to emphasize them, either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She was dressed in a plaid western shirt that was belted into a pair of worn western jeans. She had on scuffed cowboy boots, but instead of a Stetson, she usually wore a faded navy-blue-and-orange Denver Broncos ball cap. She&#x2019;d left the cap in her pickup, but her chin-length, straw-blond hair was tucked behind her ears to keep it out of her way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;My coat?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As she reached for it, Buck pulled it away. &#x201c;How about a kiss first?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve had opened her mouth to retort when a brusque male voice said, &#x201c;Give the lady her coat.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve hadn&#x2019;t heard anyone coming up behind her, which surprised her. She photographed wild animals in their natural habitat and prided herself on her awareness of her surroundings. In the wilderness, missing the slightest sound could result in being bitten by a rattler or attacked by a bear or mountain lion. She glanced over her shoulder and felt her heart skip a beat when she recognized her unlikely savior.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Connor Flynn.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Connor was third in line of the Flynn brothers, but he&#x2019;d been at the top of the teenage troublemaking list. He was thirty now but, if anything, his reputation was worse. He&#x2019;d done three tours as a Delta sergeant in Afghanistan before leaving the military with several medals to prove his heroism in battle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He&#x2019;d paid a high price for his long absences from home serving his country. A year ago his wife, Molly, who&#x2019;d been Eve&#x2019;s best friend, had died in a car accident while Connor was overseas. After the funeral, he&#x2019;d agreed to let Molly&#x2019;s parents take his kids into their home while he served the nine months left on his final tour of duty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now they were threatening to keep them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Connor had ended up in a court battle to get his two-year-old son and four-year-old daughter back. So far he hadn&#x2019;t been able to wrench them away from his late wife&#x2019;s parents. They&#x2019;d argued to a judge that Connor was a battle-weary soldier, a victim of post-traumatic stress, and therefore a threat to his children. According to all the psychological tests he&#x2019;d been forced to endure to prove them wrong, he was fine. But seeing him now, Eve wondered for the very first time if Molly&#x2019;s parents might not be completely off the mark.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Connor looked dangerous, his sapphire-blue eyes hooded, his cheeks and chin covered with at least a two-day-old beard, and a hank of his rough-cut, crow-wing-black hair resting on his scarred forehead. His lips had thinned to an ominous line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If she&#x2019;d been Buck, she would have handed over the coat in a heartbeat. But Buck wasn&#x2019;t known for his smarts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Butt out!&#x201d; Buck said. &#x201c;This is between me and Eve.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Without warning, Connor&#x2019;s hand shot out and gripped Buck&#x2019;s throat. Buck dropped the coat to protect his neck, but Connor didn&#x2019;t let go. His inexorable grasp was slowly choking the big man to death. Even using both hands, Buck couldn&#x2019;t get free.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve looked around the bar, expecting someone, anyone, to intervene. No one did. She wouldn&#x2019;t have interfered except she knew that Connor might be turning the lock and throwing away the key where custody of his kids was concerned. She didn&#x2019;t step in for Connor&#x2019;s sake. Ordinarily she wouldn&#x2019;t have thrown a glass of water to douse a Flynn on fire. But she cared very much about the future well-being of her dead friend&#x2019;s children, who needed their father alive and well and out of jail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite Connor&#x2019;s long absences, Molly had been convinced that he would take good care of their children if anything ever happened to her. Eve owed it to her best friend to make sure Connor didn&#x2019;t ruin his chance of becoming the wonderful father Molly had always believed he could be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As carefully as if she were approaching a feral wolf, Eve laid her fingertips on Connor&#x2019;s bare forearm, the one that led to the hand grasping Buck&#x2019;s throat. She turned so she was looking into his narrowed eyes. &#x201c;Connor,&#x201d; she said in a quiet voice. &#x201c;This won&#x2019;t help. Let go.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She watched his upper lip curl as though he was snarling while his gaze remained focused on the helpless man in his grasp.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Think of the kids!&#x201d; she said more urgently. &#x201c;For their sake, let go. Please.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He turned to look at her when she said &#x201c;kids&#x201d; and then seemed to hear the rest of her sentence. He looked at his hand and seemed surprised to discover that he was still choking Buck. Suddenly, he let go and took a step back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Buck gasped a breath of air, and with the next breath croaked, &#x201c;Molly&#x2019;s parents are right. You should be in a cage!&#x201d; Now that Buck was free, his two football buddies, each brandishing a pool cue, moved up to flank him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Connor stood as though in a daze, rubbing his forehead where the scar from a war wound loomed white against his tanned skin. Eve realized that if Connor didn&#x2019;t leave in a hurry, there was likely to be a free-for-all. She grabbed her fleece from the floor and her camera from the bar, gripped Connor&#x2019;s hand, and pulled him out the door after her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She headed away from the bar in case the three drunks decided to follow them outside into the frosty March evening. She hadn&#x2019;t realized where she was going until she reached her Dodge Ram pickup, which was parked under the colorful neon cowboy on a bucking bronc that lit up the bar. She let go of Connor&#x2019;s hand in order to hang her camera by its strap around her neck, then pulled on her fleece. She shook her head in disgust at his behavior in the bar as he frowned back at her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What were you thinking?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Were you trying to get arrested? Don&#x2019;t you want to be a father to Brooke and Sawyer?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking that son of a bitch was being a pain in the ass, all because of something I started in high school.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve stared at him in shock. <i>Connor</i> was responsible for all those cruel taunts about her name?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He shoved a hand through his hair, but a hank of it fell back onto his forehead. &#x201c;Thanks for getting me out of there.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I wish I hadn&#x2019;t bothered, now that I know you started that &#x2018;Eve&#x2019; business. Do you have any idea how much aggravation you caused me in high school?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He shot her a mutinous, unapologetic look. &#x201c;No more than you caused me by telling Molly I&#x2019;d take her to that Sadie Hawkins dance her freshman year. No thanks to you it turned out all right.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve felt a stab of shame. Molly had been crazy about Connor Flynn in high school. So had Eve. But she might as well have aspired to date the man in the moon. Not just because Connor was a senior and she was a freshman, but because Connor was a Flynn. A broken arm. A broken leg. Ruined dreams. Too many years of hurt and harm stood between them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Molly had desperately wanted to ask Connor to the Sadie Hawkins dance, but she&#x2019;d been too shy to do it. Eve had told her friend that she would ask for her but then chickened out. Besides, she didn&#x2019;t want her best friend dating the boy she had a crush on herself. She&#x2019;d lied and told Molly that she&#x2019;d asked Connor and he&#x2019;d said yes, figuring that Connor would blow Molly off when she came running up to him, excited that he&#x2019;d accepted her invitation, and Molly would be humiliated and never speak to him again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Admittedly, it was not her finest moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, Connor had m...</p></p><h2>The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service: Book Two Omnibus (Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service Omnibus)</h2><p>It's weird enough work, just trying everyday to turn corpses into cash when they're connected to mysterious UFO crashes, modern-day mummies, and stiffs turned to soap.

He grew up with the amiable black Guinea Hogs in Washington County, Georgia. Cohen's father died when he was just twelve years old, in 1954. His mother subsequently sold the hogs, and Cohen didn't see another one until he visited Cathy Payne's farm in 2017. Mr. Archer shares his memories of the hogs, his family's favorite breed, and how he remembered them building nests with sticks to protect their newborn litters in the woods. He also remembered their gentle natures, soft grunts, and amicable personalities.</p><p><br> <em>Saving the Guinea Hogs</em>, a narrative nonfiction book, is the first definitive history of the Guinea Hog breed. Rich in historically accurate information, it is easy to read and full of colorful characters. It is a comprehensive overview of the people who raised Guinea Hogs from 1940 to 1995, told in their own words and enlightening stories. These first-person stories reveal the subjects' deep fondness for and attachment to the amiable Guinea Hogs. Some recall a time when their families did not have access to electricity or indoor plumbing. The Guinea Hog was utilized head to tail, providing meat, lard, and grease to meet crucial family needs.</p><p><br> The Guinea Hog is a small, black, hairy, sturdy, and gentle breed of hog kept in the Southeastern United States prior to the Civil War. The Guinea Hog has long been a part of America's cultural history. Due to a confluence of factors, it was nearly extinct by the 1990s. The loss of any breed's unique genetic material can leave the future of a species in peril. <em>Saving the Guinea Hogs </em>will bring the characteristics of the hogs to life, including what is known of their history and genetics, their unique characteristics, their temperament and personality, and how they benefitted generations of small landholders. </p><p>Additionally, socioeconomic and political factors that eventually led to the near demise of the Guinea Hog are reported. Around 2004, a group of dedicated conservation breeders, encouraged by The Livestock Conservancy, stepped forward to save the Guinea Hogs. Cathy Payne interviewed many of the breeders and reports their stories through their own words. Her diligent research over several years retraces the history of the Guinea Hogs while preserving the memories of those who kept them. These stories are rich in details including how livestock was kept on the homestead or run in the woods on shared land, how they were marked and trained to come home, and how in some cases they were driven to market on foot, sometimes across state lines, and traded for produce. There are also stories about home butchering as a community affair and how smokehouses and other now-forgotten food preservation techniques were used before the families owned either refrigerators or freezers.</p><p><br> When Cathy's research brought her in contact with rare genetic bloodlines not preserved during the formation of the American Guinea Hog Association (AGHA) in 2006, she worked with a network of women to obtain these genetics and work with the registry to add valuable genetic diversity to the national herd.</p><p><br> Cathy takes what she has learned from her contacts with these breeders and focuses on strategies to preserve this breed and its distinct family bloodlines. Readers are encouraged to become active in the breed assocation and register their hogs to monitor their genetics and relatedness. Cathy states that she wants these hogs to still thrive in the year 2120 for the enjoyment of her great grandchildren. These homestead hogs are survivors worth preserving for future generations!</p><p> </p></p><p>This is my first book. I wrote it because I was interested in learning the Guinea Hogs&#39; history and was drawn to the old timers I interviewed to learn about the breed history. I started in 2013 and completed the project in 2019 after interviewing dozens of people involved with the hogs between 1950 and 2019. My process included mostly telephone interviews using Recordia Pro and using a transcriber to convert mp3 files into PDF documents for my files. Everything I found over the years had to be organized into chronological time and checked against each other for accuracy. My conclusions are stated as such. The reader can &#34;hear&#34; the opinions of several elders in order to draw their own conclusions.Cathy R. Payne had a thirty-three-year elementary teaching career serving struggling students. She has three degrees in education from the University of Georgia in Athens. In 2010, at age fifty-seven, she retired from teaching and started a sustainable farm, Broad River Pastures, in Elberton, Georgia with her husband, Jon. The farm specialized in nutrient-dense food and heritage breeds of livestock. In her third year of farming, she discovered the Guinea Hog breed. It seemed like a perfect fit for an eleven-acre homestead. She became frustrated, however, about the scant information she could find about the hogs&#39; history and bloodlines. Cathy had experience with interviews, research, and writing from her doctoral studies, so she decided to write a book herself. To complete this monumental task, she interviewed dozens of key people who had memories of the Guinea Hog and those involved in their conservation. These conversations were recorded, allowing her to share their stories word for word, preserving rich details and nuance that bring a colorful perspective to this history. The Livestock Conservancy has monitored Guinea Hogs since 1986. They opened their archives for Cathy to help her portray what was already known and recorded about the hogs, including summaries of DNA studies. Early members of the American Guinea Hog Association (AGHA) helped provide names of people she may want to contact. She spent over five years interviewing these sources and making connections between the various stories. In the midst of this project, late in 2015, Cathy stumbled upon information about two long-time Guinea Hog breeders who were dispersing their herds. Through these connections, another discovery was made by a friend in early 2016. These dispersals represented genetics that had never entered the genetic base of the AGHA. Cathy and three other women breeders joined forces to form a communication network. Working together, they urged the AGHA to begin a Genetic Recovery program. They obtained the newly discovered hogs, completed DNA testing, observed their traits, and applied for recognition through the Genetic Recover process. After two years, the hard work was rewarded and the hogs richly enhanced the biodiversity in the national herd. Cathy has been featured in several prominent podcasts to educate listeners about heritage breeds. She has presented talks about heritage breeds for the South Carolina Organization for Organic Learning, the 40th Annual conference of The Livestock Conservancy, and more. Cathy&#39;s farm is featured in a section on heritage breeds in An Ecosystem Approach to Sustainable Agriculture: Energy Use Efficiency in the American South, by Carl F. Jordan, Springer Press, 2013. Cathy is enamored with heritage breeds. She has been an active member of The Livestock Conservancy since 2010 and the American Guinea Hog Association since 2013. This is her first book and the first in a series about the Guinea Hogs. Cathy recently sold her farm and moved to Athens, Georgia to be near family and community. She now divides her time between writing, consulting, speaking, marketing, gardening, and managing her website at www.guineahogbooks.com.

There are no false notes.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i></b></p><p><b>Robert B. Parker</b> was the author of seventy books, including the legendary Spenser detective series, novels featuring Chief Jesse Stone, and the acclaimed Virgil Cole/Everett Hitch westerns, as well as the Sunny Randall novels. Winner of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award and long considered the undisputed dean of American crime fiction, Parker died in January 2010.CHAPTER ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> In memory it seems someone else, a boy in a glen plaid suit and a lime green shirt chewing gum with a cigarette behind his ear while he danced awkwardly with a girl who made his stomach buzz, and Frankie Laine sang &#x201c;Black Lace&#x201d; on the record player. But it wasn&#x2019;t someone else, it was me, or at least the beginning of me. It was the evening I was born: an embryonic kid with his hair slicked back, I danced, for the first time, with Jennifer Grayle; and the flowering of my soul was forever wed to a vision of possibility so gorgeous and unspeakable that even now it seems a trick of time and memory. No child could have felt what I felt. And yet&nbsp;...&nbsp;the buzz in my stomach has buzzed for thirty years and buzzes still, an implacable thrill of passion and purpose that has galvanized me like the touch of God&#x2019;s finger on Adam&#x2019;s inert hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> As we danced at that freshman dance in the early fall of 1950, it was as if the still serpentless meadows of Eden spread out around us. We are east of Eden now, full of knowledge. We know that lambs and lions will not gambol, if they ever did, in a green eternity. But we know much more than that, and some of what we know is worth mortality.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had gone from an unaffluent city up to Colby College in September of 1950, virginal, full of fantasy, and nearly devoid of social graces, to major in English and become a writer. I wasn&#x2019;t scared. I&#x2019;d been away before. I knew I&#x2019;d make friends, but I was frightened of girls and the freshman dance made me anxious. None of us knew one another yet. We had no gang to hang with in a corner, to play to as we danced. No one whose approval we had tested and could count on. My name tag, pinned to my wide lapels, said HI, MY NAME&#x2019;S BOONE ADAMS, WHAT&#x2019;S YOURS? Wearing it made me feel like a perfect asshole, but everyone was wearing theirs.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was wearing a black dress and there was a sort of richness about her, a density of presence that made her seem more tangible than other people. At eighteen I thought she looked sexy. Chewing three sticks of Juicy Fruit, I swaggered over and asked her to dance. Bravado.<br> &nbsp;<br> She danced as badly as I did. We were barely able to maneuver the floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> She said, &#x201c;Are you enjoying Colby so far?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, sure, it&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Where you from?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Marblehead, Mass.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I danced as close as I could. I thought it was a way to make out. Her thighs moved against me, and I could feel the faint masking slickness of her slip.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I know a guy in Marblehead. Moved there from New Bedford. Frankie Gonsalves. You know him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; she said. I pressed a little harder against her. &#x201c;What does his father do?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;His old man&#x2019;s dead,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;His old lady works in a fish market, I think. He&#x2019;s a real hot shit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t cringe at the swear word. Did that mean she&#x2019;d come across? I&#x2019;d always harbored the hope that girls who swore also screwed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I know him,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Did he go to Marblehead High?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I think he dropped out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The record ended. We stood for a moment. Then she said, &#x201c;Well, thank you very much. I hope we&#x2019;ll get to know each other better.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, maybe we should grab a few beers together sometime, huh?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, that would really be fun,&#x201d; she said. And then she walked back to the side of the room where the girls congregated. I walked back and stood among the boys I didn&#x2019;t know yet. I took the cigarette from behind my ear and put it in the corner of my mouth and snapped a paper match with one hand and lit the cigarette. I leaned my back against the wall with my hands in my pockets, and hooked my right heel over the molding ledge, and smoked my cigarette without taking it from my mouth. Cool.<br> &nbsp;<br> My thighs felt thick and hot where hers had brushed them and the light and only occasional touch of her lower belly against me as we danced seemed now to continue. I thought about her looking up at me in the moonlight with her eyes slitted and her mouth half open, her arms around my neck her head thrown back her breath smelling of champagne; a soft wind that smelled of distant violets stirred her hair. Across the room I saw her being asked to dance. She smiled and went to the floor with a tall kid from Long Island whose name I didn&#x2019;t know. He knew how to dance.<br> &nbsp;<br> I watched her looking up at him and smiling. I should have asked her again. Maybe after this number. I could feel myself shrinking inside. She moved about the floor with the kid from Long Island. The music ended. He said something, she laughed, and he left her with the girls. NOW. Hi, Jennifer, care to try it again? The new record came on. Something by Les Brown and His Band of Renown. Several of the girls she was with went to the dance floor. She was alone for a moment; she looked around. NOW. Why not now? She moved toward another group of girls. I lit a new cigarette in the corner of my mouth and walked slowly out of the room and back across the campus with the smoke stinging my eyes and my stomach knotted with something like fear and something like grief. The dark sky was very very high and I was very far from home and very very small.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Big U</h2><p><p><i>The New York Times Book Review</i> called Neal Stephenson's most recent novel "electrifying" and "hilarious".&nbsp; but if you want to know Stephenson was doing twenty years before he wrote the epic <i>Cryptonomicon</i>, it's back-to-school time.

Groups of musicians were scattered across the island; they could be glimpsed among the hardy green that had survived the winter months. Though the main meal would come later, blue-clad servants floated through the crowds with food-laden trays shaped like lily pads. On either side of the island, the Tunca River flowed leisurely by.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever else he had been, Murad--Mehmed&#x2019;s dead father and Radu&#x2019;s onetime benefactor--had not been one to skimp on luxury. The harem complex he built on the island had been out of use since his death, but it had not faded in glory. The tiles gleamed. The carved stones of the walls promised luxury and peace. The fountains tinkled in cheery companionship with the surrounding river.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Radu wandered between buildings painted like geometric gardens, pulled along as surely as the course of the river. He knew it was useless, knew that it would not make him feel better. But still he looked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And there--next to the bathhouse. Radu was drawn to him like a leaf spun on the river current. Mehmed wore his now-constant deep-purple robes and a swirling golden turban. A jeweled chain fastened a cloak around his broad shoulders. Radu tried to remember Mehmed&#x2019;s full lips parting in a smile, his eyebrows rising in mirth rather than mockery. The two young men, both having finally finished growing, were the same tall, lean height. But lately Radu felt small when Mehmed looked at him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He would have taken even that today. But Mehmed did not look his direction, immune to the connection Radu could not escape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Truly glorious,&#x201d; Halil Vizier said to Mehmed, his hands on his hips as he looked up at the new bathhouse complex. Three connected buildings, with domed roofs echoing those of mosques, had been added in the past few months. They were the first new construction anticipating Mehmed&#x2019;s grand palace complex. It would rival anything his father had ever built--anything anyone had ever built. To celebrate this investment in the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmed had invited everyone who mattered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ambassadors from various European countries mingled freely with the Ottoman elite. Mehmed stood apart, but was free with his smiles and sweeping promises of future parties at his palace. Along with his usual attendants, he was joined by Ishak Pasha, one of his most powerful spahi; Kumal Pasha, Radu&#x2019;s brother-in-law; and, as always, like a bitter taste that could not be swallowed, Halil Vizier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Radu hated thinking of his old enemy Halil Pasha as Halil Vizier. He hated even more that it had been his own plan to put Halil in a place of trust and power to keep a closer eye on him. Maybe Lada had been right. Maybe they should have killed him. Things would be easier, or at least they would be more pleasant. That should be Radu&#x2019;s place at Mehmed&#x2019;s side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As though sensing Radu&#x2019;s poisonous envy, Halil Vizier looked at him. His mouth curled in a sneering smile. &#x201c;Radu the Handsome,&#x201d; he said. Radu frowned. He had not heard that title since the end of fighting in Albania, when Skanderberg, their foe, had coined it. Mehmed glanced over, then away as soon as their eyes met. Like a butterfly alighting on a flower and finding it lacking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me,&#x201d; Halil said, that nasty smile still on his bearded face. &#x201c;Is your pretty wife aware this is not a functioning harem yet? I fear she has false hopes about entering it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The men around Halil snickered. Kumal frowned, then opened his mouth. Radu shook his head, a minute movement. Kumal looked sadly away. Mehmed did not acknowledge the insult--the implication that Radu&#x2019;s wife would enter Mehmed&#x2019;s harem to divorce Radu--but he did nothing to refute it, either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;My wife is not--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A gentle hand came down on Radu&#x2019;s arm. He turned to find Nazira. Nazira, who was not supposed to be here. &#x201c;His wife is not pleased with anyone else monopolizing his attention.&#x201d; Beneath her translucent veil, her smile was far brighter than the winter sun. She wore the colors of springtime. Still, Radu felt cold looking at her. What was she doing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nazira turned Radu away from the men and led him down a path draped in more silk than most people would ever see in their lives. It was extravagant, excessive, absurd, like everything about this party. A reflection of a sultan too young and foolish to think of anything beyond appearances and his own pleasure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d; Radu whispered urgently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on a boat ride with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I cannot! I have to--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Endure mockery from Halil Vizier? Try to regain the favor of Mehmed? Radu, what has happened?&#x201d; Nazira pulled him into the shadows of one of the buildings. To onlookers it would appear as though he were stealing a moment with his beautiful wife.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He gritted his teeth, looking at the wall above her head. &#x201c;I have business.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Your business is my business. You do not write us, you never visit. I had to learn from Kumal that you have fallen out with Mehmed. What happened? Did you . . . does he know?&#x201d; Her dark eyes were heavy with meaning, the weight of it too much for Radu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No! Of course not. I-- It is much more complicated than that.&#x201d; He turned away, but she grabbed his wrist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Fortunately for you, I am very clever and can understand even the most complicated things. Tell me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Radu ran the fingers of his free hand along the edges of his turban, tugging at it. Nazira reached up, taking his fingers in her own. Her sharp eyes softened. &#x201c;I worry about you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You do not need to worry about me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I do not worry because I need to. I worry because I care about you. I want to see you happy. And I do not think Edirne holds any happiness for you.&#x201d; She emphasized Edirne, making it clear that it was not the capital she spoke of, but what--or rather, whom--that capital held.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nazira,&#x201d; Radu hissed, &#x201c;I cannot talk about this right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He almost wished he could. He was desperate to talk to someone, anyone. But no one could help him with that problem. Radu wondered, sometimes, what Lazar could have told him if they had ever talked openly about what it meant for one man to love another. Lazar had been anything but discreet about his openness to something . . . more . . . with Radu. And Radu had rewarded Lazar&#x2019;s loyalty and friendship with a knife. Now he had no one to talk to, to ask these desperate questions. It was wrong, was it not? For him to love this way?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But when Radu looked at Nazira and Fatima, he did not feel anything other than happiness that they had found each other. Their love was as pure and true as any he had ever observed. Thoughts like this made his mind turn around in circles upon itself, until not even prayer could calm it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Radu looked down at Nazira&#x2019;s hands on his. &#x201c;The palace may not hold my happiness. But I cannot look anywhere else.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nazira released him with a sigh. &#x201c;Will you come back with me? Spend some time at home? Fatima misses you. It might do you good to be away.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There is too much to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Too much dancing? Too many parties?&#x201d; Her voice teased, but her eyes lacked an accompanying sparkle of sincerity. Her words stung him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You know I am more than that.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I do. I simply worry you might forget. You do not have to do this to yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not doing it to myself, or for myself. I-- Damn. Damn, damn, damn.&#x201d; Radu watched as a man in naval uniform--a sturdy cape, a tighter, smaller turban than the ones worn by ordinary soldiers, and a sash of Mehmed&#x2019;s colors--walked past. He was accompanied by one of Halil Vizier&#x2019;s trusted friends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Nazira followed Radu&#x2019;s gaze.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I need to talk to that man. Without anyone else being able to hear. It is the only reason I am here.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She was suddenly excited. &#x201c;You do? Is he--&#x201d; She raised her eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No! No. I just need to speak with him. In secret.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nazira&#x2019;s smile turned into a thoughtful frown. &#x201c;Can you be seen together?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but it cannot look like we met on purpose or are discussing anything of importance. I was hoping to find some quiet moment, but there are so many people here. He has not been alone since he came to the capital. Halil Vizier has seen to it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Your party attendance is more complicated than I thought, then.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Radu gritted his teeth. &#x201c;Much.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you are very fortunate you married so well.&#x201d; Nazira put a hand on his arm and steered him onto the walkway. &#x201c;Tell me about him.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;His name is Suleiman, and he is the newly promoted admiral of the navy.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nazira laughed. &#x201c;This will be easy.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She danced effortlessly from group to group with a coy smile and a word of greeting for all. Radu was on the fringes of these parties lately, a contrast to when he had been a shining focal point. But with Nazira on his arm, more people were willing to stop for a moment of conversation. He craned his neck for a view of Suleiman. Nazira pinched his arm, hard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Patience,&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After several more stops to chat with the uncle of her deceased father&#x2019;s best friend, the cousin of Kumal&#x2019;s deceased wife, and any number of other people Nazira treated with delight and deference regardless of their place in the Ottoman social hierarchy, they plowed directly into Suleiman. Somehow Nazira had managed to turn and walk so that Radu knocked the man over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; Nazira squeaked, putting her hands over her veiled mouth. &#x201c;I am so sorry!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Radu held out a hand to help the man up. They had never met before, but Suleiman&#x2019;s eyes lingered on the boat-shaped gold pin on Radu&#x2019;s cloak. &#x201c;Please forgive me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Suleiman bowed. &#x201c;I am Suleiman Baltoghlu.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Radu bowed as well. &#x201c;Radu.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Radu . . . ?&#x201d; Suleiman paused expectantly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Simply Radu.&#x201d; Radu&#x2019;s smile was tight. Lada had left him behind under the mantle of the Draculesti family. But Radu had rejected his father&#x2019;s name. He would not take it up again, ever. &#x201c;This is my wife, Nazira.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Suleiman took her hand, bowing even deeper. &#x201c;They make wives prettier in Edirne than they do in Bursa.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nazira beamed. &#x201c;That is because the wind blows too hard in harbor cities. The poor women there have to expend all their energy merely staying upright. There is no time left for being pretty.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Suleiman laughed, a loud burst of sound that drew attention. But the attention was focused on him and Nazira, not on him and Radu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me, what do you do in Bursa?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I am an admiral.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Boats! Oh, I adore boats. Look, did you see?&#x201d; Nazira pointed to the collection of delicate boats bobbing in the river. They were carved in fanciful shapes. One had a prow like the head of a frog, and its oars had webbed feet carved into their ends. Another looked like a war galley, tiny decorative oars sticking out both its sides. &#x201c;Radu is afraid if we take a boat out, he will not make it back to shore. But surely if we had an admiral with us . . .&#x201d; Nazira looked up at Suleiman through her thick eyelashes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I am at your service.&#x201d; Suleiman followed them to the dock, helping Nazira into a boat carved like a heron. A head on a slender neck pointed their way forward, and silk wings extended on either side. The tail was a canopy arching overhead to protect passengers from the sun, though it was not quite warm enough to be necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This is lovely!&#x201d; Nazira sighed happily, leaning over to trail one hand in the water. Radu was not quite so pleased--he hated boats--but he shared a secret smile with Nazira. She had done his job for him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Suleiman took the oars. Radu sat gingerly in the back of the small boat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I am going to chatter very brightly, waving my hands a lot,&#x201d; Nazira said as they pulled away from the shore, and away from any prying ears. &#x201c;In fact, I am going to talk the whole time, and you two will be unable to get a word in edgewise.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She continued her one-sided conversation--a silent one. Her head bobbed up and down, she laughed, and her hands punctuated imaginary sentences. Any onlookers would see her entertaining Suleiman while Radu tried his best to keep his stomach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How soon can you build the new galleys?&#x201d; Radu muttered, clutching the sides of the boat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Suleiman shrugged like he was trying to loosen up his shoulders for rowing. &#x201c;We can build ships as fast as he can fund them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No one can know how many ships we really have.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We will build a few galleys in Bursa for show, so it looks like I am doing something. The rest will be built in secret, in a private shipyard along the Dardanelles. But I still need men. We can have all the ships in the world, but without trained sailors, they will be as much use as the boat we are in now.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How can we train that many men in secret?&#x201d; Someone would notice if they conscripted men for a navy. A few new boats could be attributed to a foolish whim of an immature sultan. An armada, complete with the men to sail it, was another thing entirely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Give me the funds to hire Greek sailors, and I will give him the finest navy in the world,&#x201d; Suleiman said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It will be done.&#x201d; Radu leaned over the side, barely avoiding heaving.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Suleiman laughed at some new pantomime of Nazira&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Whatever you do, keep this one around. She is truly a treasure.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This time Nazira&#x2019;s laugh was real. &#x201c;I am.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Radu did not have to feign relief when Suleiman finished their loop around the island and pulled them back to the dock. He stumbled onto it, grateful for the solid wood beneath his feet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Your husband has a weak stomach,&#x201d; Suleiman said as he helped Nazira out of the boat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. It is a good thing he is so handsome.&#x201d; Nazira patted Radu&#x2019;s cheek, then waved prettily at Suleiman. &#x201c;Our navy is in most capable hands!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Suleiman laughed wryly. &#x201c;My little bird boats will be the terror of the seas!&#x201d; He bowed theatrically, then strode away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Radu said, letting Nazira take him back through the party, then into a secluded corner. They sat on a bench with their backs to the bathhouse wall. &#x201c;That was brilliant.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Theology of the Liturgy: The Sacramental Foundation of Christian Existence (Volume 11) (Collected Works, Joseph Ratzinger)</h2><p><p>This major volume is a collection of the writings of Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI) on the theology of the Liturgy of the Church, a subject of preeminence to him as a theologian, professor and spiritual writer. It brings together all his writings on the subject, short and long, giving his views on liturgical matters and questions over many years and from various perspectives.</p><p>He chose to have his writings on the Liturgy for the first volume published of his collected works (though listed as vol. 11) because, as he says in the Introduction: "The liturgy of the Church has been for me since my childhood the central reality of my life, and it became the center of my theological efforts. I chose fundamental theology as my field because I wanted first and foremost to examine thoroughly the question: Why do we believe? But also included from the beginning in this question was the other question of the right response to God and, thus, the question of the liturgy."</p><p>By starting with the theme of liturgy in this volume, Ratzinger wants to highlight God's primacy, the absolute precedence of the theme of God. Beginning with a focus on the liturgy, he said, tells us that "God is first". He quotes from the Rule of St. Benedict, "Nothing is to be preferred to the liturgy", as a way of ordering priorities for the life of the Church and of every individual. He says that the fundamental question of the man who begins to understand himself correctly is: How must I encounter God? Thus learning the right way of worshipping is the gift par excellence that is given to us by the faith.</p><p>The essential purpose of his writings on the liturgy is to place the liturgy in its larger context, which he presents in three concentric circles. First, the intrinsic interrelationship of Old and New Testament; without the connection to the Old Testament heritage, the Christian liturgy is incomprehensible. The second circle is the relationship to the religions of the world. The third circle is the cosmic character of the liturgy, which is more than the coming together of a circle of people: the liturgy is celebrated in the expanse of the cosmos, encompassing creation and history at the same time.</p></p><p><p><b>Joseph Ratzinger</b> (Pope Benedict XVI) is widely recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual leaders of our age. As Pope he authored the best-selling <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i>; and prior to his pontificate, he wrote many influential books that continue to remain important for the contemporary Church, such as <i>Introduction to Christianity</i> and <i>The Spirit of the Liturgy</i>.</p></p><h2>60 Hikes Within 60 Miles: Los Angeles: Including Ventura and Orange Counties</h2><p><b>It's Time to Take a Hike in Los Angeles!</b> <p><i>60 Hikes Within 60 Miles: Los Angeles </i> shows readers how to quickly drive to and enjoy the best hikes from the San Gabriel Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>With time, health, and pin money at a premium, this handy guide helps Angelenos get back to nature without going out of town.

It&#x2019;s a popular jogging path year-round, but it never seems overcrowded. A small secluded garden with a bench can be found at the midway point. </p><p><b>DESCRIPTION</b> </p><p>The 600-acre Elysian Park is the city&#x2019;s oldest park and second only in size to Griffith Park. No stranger to controversy, the park saw three of its communities uprooted to make room for Dodger Stadium in 1950, and later it was divided in half by the Pasadena Freeway. </p><p>Still, it&#x2019;s a great place for a solitary run or hike, though its lack of good trail maps can be confusing for those unfamiliar with the area. Birders also frequent the park; recent sightings include red-tailed hawks, western bluebirds, black-headed grosbeaks, and Lucy&#x2019;s warblers. On weekends, the park is full of picnicking families, exercise hounds, and nature lovers. If there happens to be a home baseball game, the area is even livelier; try to plan your visit so it doesn&#x2019;t coincide with the beginning or end of a game, or you will likely find yourself caught in a massive traffic jam. </p><p>The Wildflower Trail begins just beyond a lush, grassy picnic area landscaped with palm trees and picnic tables. Look for the white fire-road gate near the sign for Grace E. Simons Lodge, a rental facility for birthday parties, weddings, and corporate gatherings. Begin walking on the dirt trail past rows of tall pine and sycamore trees. To your right is a shady ravine that serves as a buffer to Stadium Way, which runs parallel with the first leg of the trail. In the spring, you&#x2019;ll soon reach the thick patches of yellow wildflowers that give the trail its name. At about 0.5 mile, the path dips downward and gives way to prominent views of both sides of I-5, one of L.A.&#x2019;s busiest roads. Hiking this trail during rush hour makes it all the sweeter as you look down on the gridlock below. Beyond the freeway and industrial areas that surround it, you can also see the Verdugo and San Gabriel Mountains. It&#x2019;s not long, however, before the path curves around to the left and heads uphill away from the freeway. Just shy of 1 mile, you&#x2019;ll pass a green water tower and glimpse private homes on the right, though they are well shrouded by trees and brush. As the uphill path levels, you&#x2019;ll reach a shady resting place with a bench, trash cans, and landscaping. This is the Marian Harlow Memorial Grove, a peaceful place to stop and rest for a moment. </p><p>For a shorter hike, take the path to the left of the garden back to the trailhead. To extend this hike, you can continue to the right for another mile or so. The trail widens a bit here and on clear days has views of the downtown L.A. skyline&#x2015;first filtered through the trees, then wide-open views. You will probably see more foot traffic along this leg of the trail, as it can also be easily accessed from a small parking lot on Academy Road. At 1.2 miles, you&#x2019;ll pass another trail that leads back to the parking lot. I had intended to take this trail back to my car, but the cloudless day made me want to prolong the hike, so I continued on the main trail as it loomed over Grace E. Simons Lodge and the Chavez Ravine Arboretum on my left. After about 0.5 mile, I reached the Academy Road parking lot and reversed course on a paved path that led back to the parking lot. </p><p><b>NEARBY ACTIVITIES</b> </p><p>Take some time before or after your hike to walk through the open-air Chavez Ravine Arboretum, near the parking lot for Grace E. Simons Lodge. Founded in 1893 by the Los Angeles Horticultural Society, the arboretum has more than 1,000 varieties of trees from around the world, including redwoods from northern California, pines from the Rocky Mountains, and eucalyptus from Australia.

In 0.8 mile, turn right at Grace E. Simons Lodge, and park along the curb or farther down the road in the parking lot adjacent to the lodge. The trailhead is just behind you to the right.</p></p><h2>Georgia in Hawaii: When Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe Painted What She Pleased</h2><p>Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2019;s Hawaiian tour celebrates natural beauty and powerful artistic convictions.<p></p>Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe was famous for painting exactly what she wanted, whether flowers or skulls.

She wants nothing more than to sell it and be done with it. But when she arrives in the North Sea enclave, she is stunned to find that "the Cottage" is not at all what she expected, nor is David Tulloch, the man most of the islanders believe to be the rightful heir.<br><br>The locals could hardly be more surprised that the heir is a woman--and an American. Loni, in turn, finds the islanders quaint and a bit behind the times. Expecting David to be as provincial as the rest of his clan, she discovers that there is far more to the man than meets the eye. And there is something about the peaceful atmosphere of the place--and the character of its most prominent citizen--that soon gets under her skin. <br><br>Beneath the peaceful surface, however, change is threatening the island of Whales Reef. David's cousin Hardy Tulloch, whose claim to the inheritance now in Loni's hands was backed by oil investors, has not been deterred in his aim to control the island. But his co-conspirators have plans of their own, plans that put Loni's very life in danger.</p><p><b>Is the Future of Whales Reef in the Hands of an Outsider?<br></b><br>Loni's brain was still spinning. If she signed the papers awaiting her back at MacNaughton's office in the Shetland capital, this Cottage where she now sat, and all the land and houses and buildings in the village&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the entire estate of old Macgregor Tulloch would be <i>hers</i>.<br><br>She still could not help thinking they had the wrong person. Yet MacNaughton repeatedly assured her there was no mistake. She was the long-lost great-great-granddaughter of Ernest Tulloch, the man they called the "Auld Tulloch." As such she was the closest heir of Ernest's childless grandson, Macgregor Tulloch.<br><br>She had initially not planned to accept the inheritance. She had almost not even answered MacNaughton's letter. But after the urgings of her boss, along with a few unexpected tugs at her heart from the unknown past, she decided to at least check out the situation. She would either sell the property or let it go to the next in line. Two of her distant cousins had been in consideration before she came along, according to MacNaughton. Either of them, thought Loni, would deserve the inheritance more than her.<br><br>After a day and a half on the remote isle, however, she was viewing her decision through altered eyes. She still planned to be on her way back to the States in what she assumed would be a few more days. Yet everything was beginning to feel much different from when she had arrived.<br><br>She didn't know what she would finally decide. All she was sure of was that she had to give it more time. She had temporarily postponed her return flight. How long "a few more days" might be, she had no idea.<b>Michael Phillips </b>is a bestselling author who has penned more than 70 books, both fiction and nonfiction.

It was September, but out on the prairie, the heat still held a mid-summer ferocity. I tried the gate in the cyclone fence, but it was heavily padlocked; when I pushed hard to see if it would open enough for me to slide through, the metal burned my fingers. A camera and a microphone were mounted on top of the gatepost, but both had been shot out. </p><p>I backed away and looked around the empty landscape. Mine had been the only car on the gravel county road as I bumped my way down from the turnoff in Palfry. Except for the crows circling and diving into the brown cornstalks across the road, I was completely alone. I felt tiny and vulnerable under the blue bowl of the sky. It closed over the earth in all directions, seeming to shut out air, to let in nothing but light and heat. </p><p>Despite dark glasses and a visored cap, my eyes throbbed from the glare. As I walked around the house, looking for a break in the fence, purple smoke rings danced in front of me. </p><p>The house was old and falling down. Glass had broken out, or been shot out, of most of the windows. Someone had nailed slabs of plyï¿½wood over them, but hadn&#x2019;t put much effort into the job: in several places the wood swung free, secured by only a couple of nails. Behind the plywood, someone had stuffed pieces of cardboard or tatty cloth around the broken panes. </p><p>The steel fence had revolving spikes on top to discourage trespassers like me. Signs warned of guard dogs, but I didn&#x2019;t hear any barking or snuffling as I walked the perimeter. </p><p>In front, the house was close to the fence and to the road, but in the back the fence enclosed a large stretch of land. An old shed had colï¿½lapsed in one corner. A giant pit, filled with refuse and stinking of chemicals, had been dug near the shed. Jugs, spray cans of solvent, and all the other fixings of a meth operation fought with coffee grounds and chicken bones for top stench. </p><p>It was behind the shed that I found the opening I needed. Someone had been before me with heavy steel cutters, taking out a piece of fence wide enough for a car to drive through. The cuts were recent, the steel along the pointed ends shiny, unlike the dull gray of the rest of the metal. As I passed between the cuts, the skin on my neck prickled with something more than heat. I wished I&#x2019;d brought my gun with me, but I hadn&#x2019;t known I was coming to a drug house when I left Chicago. </p><p>Whoever cut the fence had dealt with the back door in a similarly economic way, kicking it in so that it hung on one hinge. The smell that rolled out the open door&#x2014;metallic, like iron, mixed with rotting meat&#x2014;was all too easy to recognize.. I pulled my shirt up over my nose and looked cautiously inside. A dog lay just beyond the doorway, his chest blown open. Some large-caliber something had taken him down as he tried to protect the losers he lived with. </p><p>&#x201c;Poor old Rottweiler, your mama never meant you to guard a drug house, did she?&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;Not your fault, boy, wrong place, wrong time, wrong people.&#x201d; </p><p>Flies were busy in his wounds; the ends of his ribs were already exï¿½posed, patches of white beneath the black of dried blood and muscle. Insects had eaten out his eyes. I felt my lunch start to rise up and made it down the steps in time to throw up in the pit by the shed. </p><p>I went back to my car on wobbly legs and collapsed on the front seat. I drank some water from the bottle I&#x2019;d brought with me. It was as hot as the air and tasted rubbery, but it settled my stomach a bit. I sat for some minutes watching a farmer move up and down a remote field, dust billowing around him. He was too far away for me to hear; the only sound came from the wind in the corn, and the crows circling above it. </p><p>When my legs and stomach calmed down, I took the big beach towel I use for my dogs from the backseat. In the trunk I found an old T-shirt that I slit open so I could tie it over my nose and mouth. Armed with this makeshift mask, I returned to the house. I waved the towel hard enough to dislodge most of the flies, then covered the dog. </p><p>When I stepped over his body, it was into a kitchen from hell. A scarred wooden hutch, once painted white, was filled with spray cans of starter fluid, drain cleaner, jars part-full of ugly-looking liquids, eye droppers, Vicks inhalers, and gallon jugs labeled &#x201c;muriatic acid.&#x201d; A makeshift lab hood with an exhaust vent had been constructed over the hutch.&nbsp; Half-buried in the filth were a number of industrial face masks. </p><p>Whoever had kicked in the door had also pulled linoleum from the floor and pried up some of the rotting boards underneath. I squatted and pointed my flashlight through an opening between the exposed joists. Water heater, furnace, stood on the dirt floor below me, but no bodies as far as I could tell. Cool air rose from the basement, along with a smell of leaf mold that seemed wholesome in contrast to the chemicals around me. </p><p>I straightened and played my light around the room. It was hard to tell how much of the shambles had been caused by the dog killers and how much by the natives. </p><p>I stepped over jugs that had been knocked to the floor, skirted a couple of plug-in heaters, and moved into the rooms beyond. </p><p>It was an old farmhouse, with a front room that had once been a formal parlor, judging by the remnants of decorative tiles around the empty fireplace. These had been pried out of the mantel and shattered. Someone had held target practice against an old rolltop desk. An angry hand had smashed the drawers and scattered papers around the floor. </p><p>I stooped to look at them. Most were past-due notices from the county for taxes and for garbage pickup. The Palfry Public Library wanted a copy of Gone With the Wind that Agnes Schlafly had checked out in 1979. </p><p>Scraps of photos were all that remained of a savagely mangled alï¿½bum. When I dropped it back on the scrap heap, it dislodged one inï¿½tact picture. It was an old photo, bleached and scarred from its time in the meth house, which showed a dozen or so people gathered around a large metal egg balanced on a giant tripod. It looked like a cartoon version of a pod landing from outer space, but the group around it looked at the camera with solemn pride. Three women, in the longer skirts and thick-heeled shoes of the 1930s, sat in the middle; five men stood behind them, all in jackets and ties. </p><p>I frowned over it, wondering what the metal egg could possibly be. Pipes ran through it; perhaps it was the prototype of a machine to ferry milk from cow to refrigerated storage. Just because it was an oddity, I stuck it into my bag. </p><p>The adjacent room contained a couple of card tables and some chairs with broken backs. Empty pizza cartons, chicken bones, and a bowl of cereal that was growing mold: I could see it as a Bosch still life. </p><p>A staircase led to a second floor; tucked underneath it was a stopped-up toilet. A better detective than I might have looked inside, but the smell told me more than I wanted to know. </p><p>Three bedrooms were built under the eaves at the top of the stairs. Two of them held only mattresses and plastic baskets. These had been upended, spilling dirty clothes over the floor. The mattresses had been slit, so that hunks of batting covered the clothes. </p><p>There&#x2019;d been an actual bed and a dresser in the third bedroom, but these, too, had been ripped apart. An eight-by-ten of a young woman holding a baby had been torn from the frame, which itself had been broken in half and tossed onto the shredded bedclothes. </p><p>I picked up the photo, cautiously, by the edges. The print was so faded that I couldn&#x2019;t make out the woman&#x2019;s face, but she had a halo of dark curls. I slipped the picture into my shoulder bag along with the one of the milk pod. </p><p>A large poster of Judy Garland, with the caption Somewhere Over The Rainbow, hung by one corner over the bedstead, the tape ripped away from the other edges. I wondered if that was the drug user&#x2019;s joke: &#x201c;way up high.&#x201d; It was hard to imagine a meth addict as a purveyor of irony, but it&#x2019;s easy to be judgmental about people you&#x2019;ve never met. </p><p>The few clothes in the closet&#x2014;a gold evening gown, a velvet jacket that had once been maroon, and a pair of designer jeans&#x2014;had also been slit. </p><p>&#x201c;You got somebody pretty pissed off, didn&#x2019;t you,&#x201d; I murmured to whoever wore those clothes. My voice sounded odd in the dismemï¿½bered room. </p><p>If there&#x2019;d been anything to find in this ruined house, the dog&#x2019;s killï¿½ers already had it. In my days with the public defender&#x2019;s office, I used to see this kind of destruction with depressing frequency. </p><p>Most likely the invaders had been hunting for more drugs. Or they felt the drug dealers had done them out of something. The addicts I&#x2019;d known would have traded their mother&#x2019;s wedding ring for a single hit and then come back to shoot up the place so they could retrieve their jewelry. I&#x2019;d represented one woman who killed her own son when he couldn&#x2019;t get back the ring he&#x2019;d traded for a rock of crack. </p><p>I climbed down the steep stairs and found the door that led to the basement. I walked partway down the stairs, but a spider the size of my hand scuttling from my flashlight kept me from descending all the way. I shone my flash around but didn&#x2019;t see signs of blood or battle. </p><p>I left through the front door so that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to wade through the kitchen again. The door had a series of dead bolts, as unnecessary an investment as the security camera over the padlocked gate. Whoï¿½ever had been here before me had shot them out. </p><p>Before retreating through the gap in the fence, I found a board in the high weeds and used it to poke through the open pit. It held so many empty bottles that I didn&#x2019;t want to climb down in it, but as far as I could tell, no one was hidden among them. </p><p>I took a few pictures with my camera phone and headed for the exit. I was just skirting the fence, heading to the road, when I heard a faint whimpering from the collapsed shed. I pushed my way through weeds and rubble and pulled apart the siding. Another Rottweiler lay there. When it saw me, it feebly thumped its stub of a tail. </p><p>I bent slowly. It made no effort to attack me as I cautiously felt its body. A female, painfully thin, but uninjured as far as I could tell. She&#x2019;d gotten tangled in a mass of old ropes and fence wires. She&#x2019;d fled into the shed when her partner was murdered, I was guessing, then panicked and worked herself deep into the makeshift net. I slowly pried the wires away from her chest and legs. </p><p>When I moved away and squatted, hand held out, she got to her feet to follow me, but collapsed again after a few steps. I went back to my car for my water bottle and a rope. I poured a little water over her head, cupped my hand so she could drink, tied the rope around her neck. Once she was rehydrated, she let me lead her slowly along the fence to the road. Out in the daylight, I could see the cuts from where the wires had dug into her, but also welts in her dirty black fur. Some vermin had beaten her, and more than once. </p><p>When we reached my car, she wouldn&#x2019;t get in. I tried to lift her, but she growled at me, bracing her weak legs in the weeds along the verge, straining against the rope to get out into the road. I dropped the rope and watched as she staggered across the gravel. At the cornfield, she sniffed among the stalks until she found what she was looking for. She headed into the corn, but was so weak that she kept falling over. </p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;How about if you stay here and let me find what you&#x2019;re looking for?&#x201d; I said to her. </p><p>She looked at me skeptically, not believing a city woman could find her way through a field, but unable to go any farther herself. I couldn&#x2019;t tie her to the corn&#x2014;she&#x2019;d pull that over. I finally ordered her to stay. Whether she&#x2019;d been trained or just was too weak to go on, she colï¿½lapsed where she was and watched as I headed into the field. </p><p>The stalks were higher than my head, but they were brown and dry and didn&#x2019;t provide any shield from the sun. All around me insects zinged and stung. Prairie dogs and a snake slipped away at my approach. </p><p>The plants were set about a yard apart, the rows appearing the same no matter which direction I looked. It would have been easy to get lost, except I was following a trail of broken stalks toward the spot where the crows continued to circle. </p><p>The body was splayed across the corn like a snow angel. Crows were thick around the shoulders and hands and they turned on me with ferocious cries. </p><p><br></p></p><h2>Wintersmith (Tiffany Aching, 3)</h2><p><p></p><p><strong>ALA Best Fiction for Young Adults * ALA </strong><em><strong>Booklist </strong></em><strong>Editors' Choice * ALA Notable Children's Book</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Pratchett&#x2019;s unique blend of comedy and articulate insight is at its vibrant best.

It weaves together interviews conducted by the author, but never used in the making of the film <i>Joy Division</i> (2007) which told the story of the band in their own words, as well as those of their peers, collaborators, and contemporaries.<br><br>Here are 15 or so vivid witnesses to the band's genesis, meteoric rise, and tragic demise, including Peter Hook, Bernard Sumner, Annike Honore, Deborah Curtis, Paul Morley, Tony Wilson, Rob Gretton, Martin Hannet ... It is the story of young men driven to create and cause rock n' roll havoc inspired by literature, radical ideas, and the wasteland that was post-industrial Manchester in the late 70s. It is as intense and funny and alive on the page as only an oral history can be, recalling masterpieces like <i>Edie</i> by Jean Stein and <i>Meet me in the Bathroom</i> by Lizzy Goodman. It is essential reading.</p><p><b>Jon Savage</b> is the author of the bestselling book <i>1966</i>, <i>England's Dreaming: Sex pistols and Punk Rock</i> and <i>Teenage: The Creation of Youth, 1875&#x2013;1945</i>.

For fans of Joy Division, and of punk, post-punk, and British music generally, this is a must read."&#x2015;<i>Brooklyn Rail</i><br><br>"English music writer Savage turns his eye to one of the most iconic bands of the post-punk era. More than a dozen observers, including Joy Division members Peter Hook and Bernard Summer, tell the story of Ian Curtis' short-lived but endlessly influential band."&#x2015;<i>LA Times</i> (Buzz-worthy Books to Look Forward To)<br><br>"As much as the story of this band has been pillaged, This Searing Light proves that there were still more Joy Division stories to be told." &#x2015; <i>Popmatters</i><br><br>&#x201c;These are some of the nearly 40 people from Joy Division's inner circle whose accounts Savage, who was also there at the time, has deftly woven into an almost detective-style MRI of the band and the forces and factors that formed it. Almost particle by particle, from descriptions of Manchester's industrial beginnings to the area's cultural void, Savage makes you understand that the members of Joy Division were driven to create something of immense beauty, as if there were no other choice.&#x201d; &#x2015; <i> Los Angeles Times</i></p><h2>Master Numbers: Cycles of Divine Order</h2><p>Never before have the master numbers - 11, 22, 33, through 99 - been examined in such depth and detail.

She looks at the progression of the master numbers as the journey the soul takes as it seeks to master the different levels of understanding. Javane also analyzes the two single-digit numbers that, when added together, equal a master number, for example 2+9=11.

I pull the chair back an inch and then roll it into the door frame again. The <i>clunk</i> makes Mom sit up straight. &#x201c;You have got to be kidding me,&#x201d; she says. <br>Actually, these are not her exact words. I am not allowed to repeat her exact words. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; says Dad, who stands inside the bathroom, ready to give Mom a hand. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll figure something out.&#x201d; <br>This is the first time my mother has been home from the West Glover Hospital in over a month. They only let her leave because she promised to stay off her feet for at least forty-eight hours. I put my hand on Mom&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;What if we turn it around and back it in?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Lucy,&#x201d; Mom says to me, &#x201c;width is not a function of vector.&#x201d; <br>Mom studied math in college. She&#x2019;s a professional photographer now, but she&#x2019;s always finding ways to work things like vectors and differentials and Hilbert curves into conversation. I rarely know what she&#x2019;s talking about. <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have vectors in our math,&#x201d; Elena calls from the kitchen. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get to them in high school,&#x201d; says Michael, who is in the kitchen, too. <br>Michael Buskirk and Elena Vallejo are my best friends. They were both on the front lawn waiting to greet Mom when we got back from the hospital. The three of us met back in kindergarten when Elena was a black-haired bulldozer in a pink dress and a leg brace, and Michael was a quiet skinny boy in short pants and Space Invader T-shirts. Now we are all in the eighth grade at St. Brigid&#x2019;s Catholic School, where my dad is our principal. <br>Elena sighs. &#x201c;Vectors and high school,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait.&#x201d; <br>Elena is certain that high school is going to swallow us up, spit us out, and crush us like bugs. It&#x2019;s because she still looks like a little doll that Santa Claus would leave beneath a Christmas tree. I resemble one of those gawky stuffed giraffes that nobody ever wins at the carnival, but Michael is over six feet tall. He&#x2019;s strong and easygoing with dark hair and brown eyes that match the color of his skin. I think he&#x2019;s the best-looking boy in our school. He lives just across the street from me, so I see him enough to know that I&#x2019;m right. <br>&#x201c;Elena,&#x201d; Dad shouts from the bathroom. &#x201c;Please stop worrying about high school. It&#x2019;s months away, and it&#x2019;s going to be fine.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d; she yells back at him. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of the things they teach you in principal school,&#x201d; he tells her. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got you there,&#x201d; Michael says to Elena. <br>&#x201c;In the meantime,&#x201d; says Mom, &#x201c;I still really have to pee.&#x201d; A few wisps of thin, brown hair have escaped the paisley scarf wrapped around her head. Dark circles beneath her eyes make it look like she&#x2019;s been punched in the face. Cancer will do that to you. <br>Dad examines the doorway leading into the bathroom. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get another inch of clearance if I take the door off the frame.&#x201d; At school, I&#x2019;ve seen him unclog toilets, mop up vomit, set a broken bone, and rescue a wide variety of rodents, snakes, amphibians, and other classroom pets without even loosening his tie. Popping a door off its hinges is not going to be a problem. <br>Michael hops off the kitchen counter. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get the toolbox.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a screwdriver in the junk drawer,&#x201d; says Elena. <br>The two of them know where everything is. They&#x2019;ve pretty much grown up in our house, and sometimes we&#x2019;re more like family than friends. I love having Elena as a sister, but lately I&#x2019;m thinking it might be nice if Michael were a little less brotherly and a little more friendly. That&#x2019;s another door I don&#x2019;t know how to get through. <br>&#x201c;How about we just do this?&#x201d; says Mom. Without waiting for an answer, she places both hands on the wheelchair&#x2019;s armrests and pushes herself into a standing position. <br>&#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d; I say. <br>Dad quickly reaches an arm around Mom&#x2019;s waist then takes her hand. &#x201c;May I have this dance?&#x201d; he asks. <br>Mom takes a breath. &#x201c;Lead me to the toilet first.&#x201d; <br>My parents say it&#x2019;s the everyday moments&#x2014;folding laundry, washing dishes, pouring each other a cup of coffee&#x2014;that make their marriage a good one. I know they&#x2019;re right, but I&#x2019;m hoping for something a little more romantic than a stroll into the bathroom one day. <br>With Dad&#x2019;s help, Mom takes a small step forward. &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; I ask her. <br>Mom takes another step then places a free hand on the sand dollars and sea fans and junonias that decorate our bathroom wallpaper. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy to be home.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And cancer free,&#x201d; says Dad. <br>She nods. &#x201c;That too.&#x201d; <br>A year ago, the doctors explained that Mom&#x2019;s disease&#x2014;something with a name that sounded like <i>angie-mumbo-jumbo-plastic-lycanthrope</i>&#x2014;was rare, aggressive, and generally fatal. In other words, she had a roughly zero chance to live. Even <i>I</i> understood that math. A week ago, those same doctors announced that she was cured. &#x201c;How is that possible?&#x201d; I asked. <br>The doctors shrugged. Sometimes, they told Dad and me, it just happens. Afterward, one of Mom&#x2019;s nurses found us in the hospital corridor. &#x201c;God heard your prayers,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how it happened.&#x201d; <br>It&#x2019;s true that we&#x2019;d been doing a lot of praying, but until now it didn&#x2019;t seem like anybody was really listening. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about that,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;God heard you,&#x201d; the nurse said again. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a miracle.&#x201d; And then she burst into tears. <br>Neither Dad nor I backed away. I think it&#x2019;s because we both spend our days in Catholic school. That&#x2019;s where you learn that faithful people can be a little insane sometimes. On the other hand, is it more sensible to accept that everything is random or is it better to believe that God can step in occasionally and repair your T cells? I don&#x2019;t know. <br>Either way, Mom is on her feet now. She&#x2019;s moving forward with Dad on her arm as if they are about to meet the Queen of England in our bathroom. Mom even offers dainty royal wrist waves as she exits the hallway. This should be funny, but I don&#x2019;t laugh. I suppose this is the result of even more Catholic school stuff filling up my head. We&#x2019;re taught that sometimes the world is a puzzle waiting for us to solve it. Other times it&#x2019;s a mystery to appreciate and accept. Right now I think my family, my friends&#x2014;maybe even my whole life&#x2014;are a whole lot of both. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Text copyright ï¿½ 2014 by Paul Acampora <br></p><h2>Russia&#x2019;s Wars in Chechnya 1994&#x2013;2009 (Essential Histories)</h2><p><p>Featuring specially drawn full-color mapping and drawing upon a wide range of sources, this succinct account explains the origins, history and consequences of Russia's wars in Chechnya, thereby shedding new light on the history - and prospects - of that troubled region.</p><p>Mark Galeotti, an expert on the conflict, traces the progress of the wars, from the initial Russian advance through to urban battles such as Grozny, and the prolonged guerrilla warfare based in the mountainous regions that is common to both wars. He assesses how the wars have torn apart the fabric of Chechen society and their impact on Russia itself, where they have influenced presidential elections and widened the gulf between the military and the rest of society. These were savage conflicts which combined at different times the characteristics of an imperial war, a civil war and a terrorist campaign. The rich tradition of banditry in Chechnya, exemplified by the disproportionately large numbers of Chechens in the Spetsnaz special forces, gave the conflict its particular character, as did the steady shift from the initial nationalism to being inspired by a wider Islamic jihad.</p></p><p>Professor Mark Galeotti, formerly senior lecturer in international history at Keele University, is Clinical Professor of Global Affairs, New York University. He is a former Foreign Office adviser on Russian security affairs, and for 15 years (1991-2006) wrote a monthly column on this for Jane&#39;s Intelligence Review.

This masterfully illustrated classic is skillfully adapted by Newbery Award-winning author Robin McKinley and remains faithful to the original. With simple text to read aloud to young children, it's little wonder that <i>The Boston Globe</i> says it is "certain to quicken the hearts of young horse lovers." A timeless tale of courage, hope, and strength guaranteed to delight a new generation of readers.</p><p>A horse is a horse of course unless of course the horse is Black Beauty. Animal-loving children have been devoted to <i>Black Beauty</i> throughout this century, and no doubt will continue through the next. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints a clear picture of turn-of-the-century London, its message is universal and timeless: animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness.<p> <i>Black Beauty</i> tells the story of the horse's own long and varied life, from a well-born colt in a pleasant meadow to an elegant carriage horse for a gentleman to a painfully overworked cab horse. Throughout, Sewell rails--in a gentle, 19th-century way--against animal maltreatment. Young readers will follow Black Beauty's fortunes, good and bad, with gentle masters as well as cruel. Children can easily make the leap from horse-human relationships to human-human relationships, and begin to understand how their own consideration of others may be a benefit to all. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p>Black Beauty's tale, as told by himself, is the fascinating story of the life of a horse a hundred years ago, when horseswere a part of everyone's life.<p></p><p>Although his colthood and early life were happy, Black Beauty tastes the bitterness of cruel grooms and indifferent masters as he passes from hand to hand, progressing from the country to London and back again.</p><p></p><p>This, the most famous horse story ever written, is a must on everyone's reading list.</p></p><h2>Relearning to See: Improve Your Eyesight Naturally!</h2><p><p>In this accessible presentation of the famous Bates method, Thomas R. Quackenbush (who teaches the Bates method in California and Oregon) describes how eyesight can improve naturally, at any age and regardless of heredity. This book is a wonderful tribute to the genius of Dr. Bates, who was a pioneer in discovering how vision becomes blurred and how it restores itself naturally to clarity and acuity. Now 80 years later, his findings and teachings remain light years ahead of our contemporaries. His approach to treating vision problems was truly holistic and the theme throughout this book is very much an extension of that holistic approach. Dr. Quackenbush is to be commended for his dedication in getting the truth out and keeping the torch burning in this "bible" on vision improvement.</p></p><p>This huge book, filled with illustrations and color, walks one through the original Bates writings with updates and improvements. Quackenbush&#39;s work seizes the head of the field.In writing Relearning to See over an eight year period, I wanted to produce the largest, most comprehensive, historical, scientific, convincing and thoroughly researched book ever written on this topic. Drawing on my 16 years of fulltime teaching I wanted to give to the world the finest information available. I have included nearly one hundred of my own students testimonials and references to natural eyesight improvements by thousands of other Natural Eyesight Improvement students. <p>One of the most important messages in this book is the clarification of the misconception that Natural Eyesight Improvement and the Bates method involves "eye exercises." If a person does eye exercises without relearning correct, natural vision habits all day long, he or she will not succeed. Dr. Bates taught his students to relearn natural vision habits all day long-not eye exercises for twenty minutes each day. Many people who study the Bates method, and even many Bates method teachers, are not aware of this fact. When a Natural Eyesight Improvement student is given the correct understanding of the Bates educational method, success is far more likely.</p></p><h2>With Lee in Virginia</h2><p>In this spirited tale of adventure, Vincent Wingfield, who is not yet sixteen, returns home to Virginia after four years of school in England to find conditions in America greatly unsettled.

After all, it was Jack Bruce who had the looks, and who co-wrote and sang all the band's major hits. But he was a singular talent who wanted to be a pioneer, not just a pop star. His background is in classical music and jazz; at 10 he was winning classical song contests, at 12 composing string quartets and improvising on piano. Then he fell in love with Thelonious Monk and Charlie Mingus and left home at 18 to find his fortune as a jazz bass player. He found his way into the London blues scene and played with luminaries such as John Mayall and Graham Bond before first tasting chart success with Manfred Mann. Then there was Cream, one of the most influential rock bands of their time, who sold 35 million albums during their two-year existence. Cream split in their prime but their influence endured, and when they reformed in 2005 tickets were selling for nearly $3000 on e-bay. In the 40 years since Cream split Bruce has continued his musical adventures with the likes of John McLaughlin, Billy Cobham, Carla Bley and Mick Taylor, never quite achieving the success and recognition he deserves. It has been an often troubled life -- heroin addiction, management rip-offs, family tragedy, and a failed liver transplant, all of which he speaks about frankly in this book, telling a story that is sometimes funny, sometimes bleak, and always honest.</p></p><p><p><b>Harry Shapiro</b> is an author, journalist, and lecturer who has written widely on the subjects of drugs, popular music, and film for over 30 years.

The British Museum&#39;s collections include numerous inscribed objects, scripts and pictorial reliefs which provide such evidence. There is, for example, a Babylonian clay tablet which records Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s siege of Jerusalem in 597 BC, as narrated in the book of Jeremiah. For this book the author has selected over seventy such &#39;documents&#39;, mainly from Western Asia, with some examples included from Greece, Egypt and Asia Minor, dating from the period of the Patriarchs to the New Testament times, c. 2000 BC to c.

Not a history of ethnography so much as a chronicle of its uses and potentials, <i>Asking and Listening</i> examines the premises of ethnography and concerns itself with a wide range of issues such as ethnocentrism and the morass of cultural relativism, the cultures of corporations, and the meaning of ethnography for government policy. It ends with an examination of the problems in charting our tomorrows: ethnography in the information age, and for the future. Through its pragmatic analysis of cultures as storehouses of alternatives in the way universal problems can and have been approached, <i>Asking and Listening</i> offers readers not merely the opportunity to make sense of descriptions of other peoples' lifeways, but makes such ethnographic knowledge immediately useful in their own lives and choices and career plans.<p> Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Anderson, <i>Around the World in 30 Years: Life as a Cultural Anthropologist</i> (ISBN 9781577660576); Angrosino, <i>Projects in Ethnographic Research</i> (ISBN 9781577663690); DeVita, <i>Stumbling Toward Truth: Anthropologists at Work</i> (ISBN 9781577661252); Garbarino, <i>Sociocultural Theory in Anthropology: A Short History</i> (ISBN 9780881330564); Gardner-Hoffman, <i>Dispatches from the Field: Neophyte Ethnographers in a Changing World</i> (ISBN 9781577664512); Malinowski, <i>Argonauts of the Western Pacific: An Account of Native Enterprise and Adventure in the Archipelagoes of Melanesian New Guinea,</i> Enhanced Edition (ISBN: 9781478602095); and van der Elst, <i>Culture as Given, Culture as Choice,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577662693).</p></p><p>Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Anderson, Around the World in 30 Years: Life as a Cultural Anthropologist (ISBN 9781577660576); Angrosino, Projects in Ethnographic Research (ISBN 9781577663690); DeVita, Stumbling Toward Truth: Anthropologists at Work (ISBN 9781577661252); Garbarino, Sociocultural Theory in Anthropology: A Short History (ISBN 9780881330564); Gardner-Hoffman, Dispatches from the Field: Neophyte Ethnographers in a Changing World (ISBN 9781577664512); and van der Elst, Culture as Given, Culture as Choice, Second Edition (ISBN 9781577662693).&#34;This is a book my students can use forever!&#34; Violet Sparks, Brookhaven College</p><h2>Geography: Realms, Regions, and Concepts</h2><p>With exceptional content, the 17th&nbsp;edition of&nbsp;<b><i>Geography: Realms, Regions, and Concepts</i></b>, maintains its position as the market-leading world regional geography title, with a new twist&#x2015;a new lead author and new contributors who bring fresh and modern perspectives.

As arguments raged in mid-Victorian Britain about giving the working man the vote, and democracies overseas were pitched into despotism and civil war, Bagehot took a long, cool look at the "dignified" and "efficient" elements which made the English system the envy of the world. His analysis of the monarchy, the role of the prime minister and cabinet, and comparisons with the American presidential system are astute and timeless, pertinent to current discussions surrounding devolution and electoral reform. Combining the wit and panache of a journalist with the wisdom of a man of letters steeped in evolutionary ideas and historical knowledge, Bagehot produced a book which is always thoughtful, often funny, and surprisingly entertaining.This edition reproduces Bagehot's original 1867 work in full, and introduces the reader to the dramatic political events that surrounded its publication.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Fat doesn&#x2019;t matter. Carbs are the real reason you can&#x2019;t lose weight.</i><br><br>The low-carb universe Dr. Atkins brought into being continues to expand. Low-carb diets, from South Beach to the Zone and beyond, are still the go-to method for weight-loss for millions. These diets&#x2019; marketing may differ, but they all share two crucial components: the condemnation of carbs&#x201d; and an emphasis on meat and fat for calories. Even the latest diet trend, the Paleo diet, is despite its increased focus on (some) whole foods just another variation on the same carbohydrate fears.<br><br>In<i> The Low-Carb Fraud</i>, longtime leader in the nutritional science field T. Colin Campbell (author of <i>The China Study</i> and <i>Whole</i>) outlines where (and how) the low-carb proponents get it wrong: where the belief that carbohydrates are bad came from, and why it persists despite all the evidence to the contrary. The foods we misleadingly refer to as carbs&#x201d; aren&#x2019;t all created equal and treating them that way has major consequences for our nutritional well-being.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re considering a low-carb diet, read this e-book first.

The child&#x2019;s eyes were pools of tears, its mouth contorted into a wailing &#x201c;O.&#x201d; The mother made calming shushing noises, but the baby didn&#x2019;t seem to hear them. Ahead of Bill, a teenage girl with a nose ring and a neck tattoo tried to calm a man holding a bloody rag against his shaven head. The man appeared agitated, waving his free hand around as though orating to a crowd.</p><p>Bill looked to his right. He saw a small crowd gathered but no one he recognized.</p><p>He felt overwhelmed. Alone.</p><p>A nurse sat behind the admitting desk. She held a metal clipboard and wore half-moon glasses perched on the end of her nose. The glasses aged her, made her look ten years older than she probably was.</p><p>Bill approached her, a knot of tension growing in his chest.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; Bill said.</p><p>&#x201c;Just a minute.&#x201d; The woman turned and stood up, walking away from Bill and going through a door behind her.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; Bill said, his voice low.</p><p>He tapped his finger on the Formica desk.</p><p>She&#x2019;s here. Somewhere. She&#x2019;s here.</p><p>Should I just go find her?</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said, his voice louder.</p><p>But the nurse didn&#x2019;t return. And no one else came out of the room to help him.</p><p>It felt like one of those dreams, the kind he&#x2019;d been having too often lately. In the dreams, he&#x2019;d open his mouth to scream but could make no sound. And the very act of trying to force words out made his throat feel as if he&#x2019;d swallowed broken glass.</p><p>Bill looked around, hoping to see a familiar face. He saw only misery. The people in the room&#x2014;the bleeders and the criers and the scared&#x2014;were all his companions in misery.</p><p>She is here. She too is one of them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>The admitting nurse appeared again. She still carried the clipboard. She went out of her way not to make eye contact with Bill. She focused on the desktop, coming over and reaching for a piece of paper.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; Bill said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here because&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One second, hon,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>The nurse lifted the paper, studying it through her glasses. Her hair was streaked with gray, her pink smock decorated with a small mustard stain.</p><p>&#x201c;My daughter&#x2014;,&#x201d; Bill said.</p><p>The woman raised her index finger in the air, requesting silence. She turned again, disappearing back behind the door through which she&#x2019;d just emerged.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Bill said.</p><p>But she was gone.</p><p>Bill craned his neck, rising up on tiptoes to try to see into the room. He couldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>No response.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; he said, his voice rising.</p><p>The nurse stuck her head out the door, her face creased with agitation. &#x201c;Sir, we&#x2019;re backed up now. I&#x2019;ll be right there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;</p><p>Echoing off the walls and the tiled floor, the single word cut through the room, bringing everyone to a halt. Bill sensed their anticipation, their fear, and, yes, their glee. They might get to witness a scene.</p><p>Some guy went apeshit in the ER.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>The nurse stood up. She looked angry as she walked toward him.</p><p>&#x201c;My daughter is here,&#x201d; Bill said. &#x201c;Summer Price. Summer Price is my daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>And then the nurse&#x2019;s features softened. She understood.</p><p>She recognized the name. Everyone in the room probably did.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; she said, removing her glasses. &#x201c;I know who to call.&#x201d;</p><p>A minute passed, maybe less, and then someone came through another door and into the emergency room, a familiar face above a coat and tie.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Price?&#x201d;</p><p>Bill felt the smallest measure of relief. &#x201c;Detective Hawkins,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Where is she? Where&#x2019;s Summer? Someone called. They said you were here&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Hawkins wiggled his fingers, his hand in the air. &#x201c;This way, okay? This way.&#x201d;</p><p>Bill followed the detective as Hawkins stepped over to a plain brown door and turned the knob. It looked like a janitor&#x2019;s closet, and Bill wondered why he was being led where mops and buckets were stored.</p><p>But then he saw it was a consultation room, one of those places where doctors took families to give them bad news. Bill had been in one of them before, almost a year and a half earlier. Nothing good ever happened in one of those rooms.</p><p>He stopped in his tracks even as Hawkins reached for him, trying to guide Bill along.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d; Bill asked. &#x201c;Just tell me something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Inside, Bill. Please? We can talk in there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is she alive?&#x201d; Bill felt anger laced with fear building in his chest, the heat and pressure at his core like lava waiting to burst forth. He gritted his teeth. &#x201c;Just tell me the truth. On the phone they said she&#x2019;s alive. Is Summer alive?&#x201d;</p><p>Hawkins stared directly into Bill&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s alive, Bill. Summer is alive.&#x201d;</p><p>Bill closed his eyes, as though bracing for a blow. He felt a slight cooling in his body, a tiny sliver of relief. Okay, he thought. Alive. She&#x2019;s alive.</p><p>&#x201c;When can I see her?&#x201d; he asked, opening his eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s alive, Bill,&#x201d; Hawkins said. &#x201c;But&#x2014;we should talk inside.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Bill&#x2019;s hands shook as he sat in the consultation room.</p><p>The space was small, confining. The papered walls were brown, earth tones, something meant to be soothing. The furniture felt stiff and unforgiving. Some well-meaning soul had placed a vase full of artificial flowers on the coffee table, an attempt to cheer the uncheerable. Bill stared at them, wishing his eyes were lasers that could destroy.</p><p>Hawkins sat down across from him. He looked to be in his early fifties, about ten years older than Bill. His salt-and-pepper hair was messy, as if he&#x2019;d just come inside out of a stiff wind. He wore a sport coat and no tie, his graying chest hair reaching up from the open-neck shirt like spiders&#x2019; legs.</p><p>Bill tried to keep his voice steady, to not shout at or berate the public servant before him. &#x201c;Tell me what&#x2019;s going on, Detective. Tell me when I can see Summer. I want to see her.&#x201d;</p><p>The room felt too familiar. Hell, it might have been the same one he sat in when Julia died. He feared he would be getting horrible news from Detective Hawkins.</p><p>&#x201c;Summer is alive, but she&#x2019;s critically injured. She&#x2019;s been stabilized, and they&#x2019;re moving her to Intensive Care. You can see her in a moment once they have her settled in up there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What happened to her? How was she injured? Wait a minute&#x2014;where the hell was she? She&#x2019;s been gone for almost two days. Where? Tell me something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They were found in Dunlap Park.&#x201d; Hawkins spoke with a soothing Kentucky accent, his words rolling out like a gentle stream. Bill tried to reconcile the awful message with the sweet sound of the messenger. &#x201c;Early this morning, we received an anonymous call at the station. Not a nine-one-one call&#x2014;just the general line. The caller told the officer who answered that two girls could be found in Dunlap Park.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dunlap Park?&#x201d; Bill looked down and saw the flowers again. He lifted his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Did Summer hang out there?&#x201d; Hawkins asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Bill said before the question was even finished. &#x201c;I told her to stay away from that park. You know what it&#x2019;s like there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;</p><p>When Bill and Julia moved to town eight years earlier, brought there by Bill&#x2019;s job, the park was a notorious gay cruising ground. A math teacher from Jakesville High, a meek man with a wife and two children, was arrested in a park restroom after soliciting a male undercover cop. Just a few years earlier, a Jakesville town councilman was caught there having sex with a county auditor, a woman who was not his wife.</p><p>&#x201c;All I hear about these days are the drugs out there. Heroin even,&#x201d; Bill said. &#x201c;Right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There have been some problems with that, yes. Also a homeless issue. People living in tents and other makeshift shelters. I&#x2019;m not saying they are responsible for all of the crime, but it doesn&#x2019;t help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Some problems? No, I told Summer to never go there. Never.&#x201d; Bill shifted forward in his uncomfortable chair, moving his body closer to the edge so that he almost slid onto the floor. He felt control slipping away as the angry part of him asserted itself, almost like another man who lived inside of him and jumped out in situations like the one in the hospital. &#x201c;Who made this call? Do you know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t. It was a man, speaking with a deeper voice, possibly disguised. The call was too short to trace, and we don&#x2019;t record the calls that come in on that line. But the tip proved to be accurate, so we&#x2019;re going to do what we can to find out who called.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t told me what happened to her. What are her injuries? Hold it&#x2014;are we talking about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Did somebody&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s being checked for everything, including sexual assault. There&#x2019;s no obvious sign of sexual trauma, but some of her clothes were torn when she was found. We&#x2019;re lucky it&#x2019;s above freezing today, or exposure could have been an issue. She might have been out there for a number of hours.&#x201d;</p><p>Bill folded his hands and lowered his head. He wanted to close his eyes and make the whole situation go away. And he understood he was one of a long line of people to sit in a room like this and wish more than anything they could be somewhere else.</p><p>&#x201c;The problem right now is that Summer has been severely beaten. She has extensive wounds to her head and torso. And a lot of swelling. They need to do X-rays and CAT scans and all of that to see how bad it is inside. But her injuries are quite severe, and you need to brace yourself for the likelihood that she&#x2019;ll need surgery and possibly extensive rehabilitation. Whoever did this wanted to hurt her, and they did. Very badly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just want to see her. I don&#x2019;t want her lying somewhere alone while she goes through this. Can you do that for me, please?&#x201d;</p><p>Hawkins said, &#x201c;Of course. I just wanted you to understand where we stood before you saw her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s my daughter,&#x201d; Bill said. &#x201c;I can handle anything that has to do with her.&#x201d;</p><p>He hoped he could. He had to do it alone.</p><p>The two men stood up. Hawkins was larger than Bill, barrel-chested, but with a gentle manner that seemed in contrast with the probing intensity of his blue-gray eyes. Bill wondered if they assigned Hawkins to Summer&#x2019;s case for a reason, if they believed that the detective&#x2019;s soothing tones and intimidating size would somehow placate, or short of that, corral Bill and keep him calm.</p><p>Before Hawkins opened the door, Bill grabbed the detective&#x2019;s arm. It felt like taking hold of a tree trunk.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; Bill said. &#x201c;Them. You said they were found. You mean Summer and Haley. I didn&#x2019;t think to ask, but how is Haley doing?&#x201d;</p><p>Hawkins hesitated for the briefest of seconds. Then he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Bill, but Haley was deceased at the scene. She&#x2019;d been beaten more severely than Summer. Her injuries were too extensive for anyone to survive.&#x201d;</p><p>The room tilted. Bill reached out and braced himself against the wall. Hawkins placed his rocklike hand on Bill&#x2019;s shoulder, steadying him.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you going to pass out?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Do you want some water?&#x201d;</p><p>Bill stood still for a moment. Images of the ever inseparable Haley and Summer flashed across his mind. The two skinny, blond girls running through a sprinkler on a summer day when they were ten. The two girls giggling over a silly movie when they were twelve. The two girls leaving his house together on Saturday afternoon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Her mother? She lives with her mother,&#x201d; Bill asked.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s been informed.&#x201d; Hawkins&#x2019;s voice conveyed the pain of that conversation, the necessary but awful duty he probably performed himself. &#x201c;Would you like to sit down?&#x201d;</p><p>He felt sick. Physically sick. His body seemed to have turned to ice.</p><p>But he shook his head. He needed to go on.</p><p>His daughter needed him. Desperately.</p><p>But before he left the room, he needed to do one thing. He took two steps to the coffee table, took hold of the offending vase, and hurled it against the wall&#x2014;screaming as he did so&#x2014;where it shattered into hundreds of fragments.</p><p>Bill&#x2019;s breathing was fast, his heart thumping.</p><p>He really didn&#x2019;t feel any better. He turned to Hawkins, who wore an impassive look on his face.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; Bill said. &#x201c;I want to see Summer. Now.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>A doctor waited outside the door to Summer&#x2019;s room.</p><p>She looked young, not much older than Summer to Bill&#x2019;s eyes. She wore blue scrubs and a white lab coat. At some point in the day she&#x2019;d put a pencil in her hair to hold it up in a messy bun.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Dr. Renee Davis,&#x201d; she said, cutting to the chase. &#x201c;Summer&#x2019;s injuries are severe. She has two broken ribs, one of which punctured her lung, causing it to collapse. She also has a hairline fracture of the skull as well as a fracture of her eye socket. And a number of cuts and abrasions, some of which required stitches. She doesn&#x2019;t need surgery right now, but we can&#x2019;t rule that out. It&#x2019;s too early to tell whether she&#x2019;ll have any long-term damage from these injuries.&#x201d;</p><p>An annoying beeping sound came from Dr. Davis&#x2019;s pocket. She reached in and pressed a button, making it stop. But she didn&#x2019;t say anything else. She looked at Bill as though she expected him to say something. He felt like an actor on a stage who didn&#x2019;t know his lines.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Long-term damage. What does that mean?&#x201d;</p><p>He looked from the doctor to the detective and back again, unsure who would provide the answer.</p><p>&#x201c;It means we don&#x2019;t know if her vision will be affected,&#x201d; Davis said. &#x201c;Or if there is any brain damage. We&#x2019;re encouraged because there doesn&#x2019;t appear to be any bleeding or swelling in the brain. But we&#x2019;ll have to watch her closely for the next forty-eight hours.&#x201d;</p><p>Brain damage. Vision loss.</p><p>The nightmare might never end. It might continue on and on for the rest of Summer&#x2019;s life. The very essence of who she was could be shattered. Her laugh. Her intelligence. Her sarcastic humor.</p><p>But she was alive. Bill reminded himself of that.</p><p>Life. That mattered.</p><p>&#x201c;I just want to see her,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Even if she&#x2019;s not awake, I don&#x2019;t want her to be alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Her injuries are quite severe,&#x201d; Davis said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to sugarcoat this, Mr. Price, but we have to watch her very carefully. She&#x2019;s gravely injured.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard that already.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because of the swelling in her face, she looks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bad?&#x201d; Bill said. &#x201c;Is seeing that worse than not knowing where she was all weekend?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not going to look like the girl who left your house two days ago,&#x201d; Davis said.</p><p>Bill stepped past the doctor.</p><p>&#x201c;Bill?&#x201d; It was Detective Hawkins&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>Bill stopped and looked at the two professionals.</p><p>Hawkins turned to Davis as though they both knew something, and then Hawkins said, &#x201c;Her hands are bandaged. She had a number of injuries to them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are her hands permanently damaged?&#x201d; Bill asked.</p><p>&#x201c;It means she resisted, Bill,&#x201d; Hawkins said, his voice tinged with a paternal pride he seemed to want Bill to experience as well. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re injuries consistent with someone who put up a very good f...</p></p><h2>Field Guide to New England Barns and Farm Buildings (Library of New England)</h2><p>The quintessential New England barn&#x2013;photogenic, full of character, and framed by flaming autumn foliage&#x2013;is an endangered species. Of some 30,000 barns in Vermont alone, nearly a thousand a year are lost to fire, collapse, or bulldozers. Thomas Durant Visser&#x2019;s field guide to the barns, silos, sugar houses, granaries, tobacco barns, and potato houses of New England is an attempt to document not just their structure but their traditions and innovations before the surviving architectural evidence of this rich rural heritage is lost forever. A recognized authority on historic barn preservation, Visser has combed the six-state region for representative barns and outbuildings, and 200 of his photographs are reproduced here. The text, which includes accounts from 18th&#x2013; and 19th&#x2013;century observers, describes key architectural characteristics, historic uses, and geographic distribution as well as specific features like timbers and frames, sheathings, doors, and cupolas. From English barns to bank barns, from ice houses to outhouses, these irreplaceable assets, Visser writes, &#x201c;linger as vulnerable survivors of the past. Yet before these buildings vanish, each has a story to tell.&#x201d; Travelers, residents, and scholars alike will find Visser&#x2019;s text invaluable in uncovering, understanding, and appreciating the stories inherent in these dwindling cultural artifacts.</p><p>5 1/2 x 9 trim. 294 illus. 9 figs.

But after a while, uncurling in the darkness, I began to discover myself, and I was a woman.</p><p>All around was blackness and no-sound. With my hands I felt old crusts of rock. There was an ancient bitter smell without a name pressing into my nostrils. I crawled out of the recess I had been lying in, and found a sort of passage where I could stand upright. Oddly, I did not wonder if I was blind. It was cold and airless as I felt a way along the passage. My foot struck hard on an obstruction. I kneeled and felt it carefully. A step, followed by other steps, hewn out roughly from the inner rock, and not much trodden. I could remember abruptly other staircases, made of smooth veined white stuff, slippery almost as glass, deeply indented at their center from countless feet passing up and down.</p><p>I went cautiously up the steps, feeling always with my hands. I did not think to count them, but there were many, at least a hundred. And then a flat space without steps. Foolishly I had quickened my pace, thankful to be on level ground, but I was punished. Suddenly there was no more stone in front, only an unsensable void. I swayed like a dancer on the brink of the invisible drop, then flung backward and saved myself. A skitter of stones fell down into the blackness. I heard them falling for a long time, bouncing often against the walls.</p><p>I was terrified now. How could I go on without seeing? The next mistake might be fatal, and already, without even knowing who I was, I knew my life was important to me. I sensed, too, something fighting against me in the dark, a malignant, one-sided battle, and I feared it and was angry.</p><p>On hands and knees I went forward very slowly, away to the left of the drop. After a moment, my outstretched hand clawed at emptiness. I turned back, going to the right. A few seconds, and the third corner of the abyss was sucking at my grasp.</p><p>I was filled with fury. I screamed out a curse in the dark, and the sound echoed and echoed until I thought the rock would split in pieces.</p><p>Where now? Perhaps there was nowhere. I lay on the ledge and wept, and then curled again, like an animal or a fetus, and slept. That was the end of my first awakening.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The second time was better. The original sleep had been no normal sleeping; this was, and I woke with a different awareness of things.</p><p>I reasoned in the dark that if the staircase ended in nothing, then I would have to go back down the stairs to the passage, and retrace my steps until I found some other way. It occurred to me then, for the first time, that I was seeking the surface, with an instinctive knowledge of being underground.</p><p>Crawling back across the platform to the stairs, my hands and then my knees encountered a square dip in the rock. I searched it and discovered a seam. This must be a door. Even while I was trying to find some way to open it, it slipped suddenly inward. I found myself, still in absolute blackness, hanging over another unguessable void, my scrabbling fingertips clutching at one smooth edge of the door. There was no hope. My fingers lost their grip and I fell. I thought that was the end of it, but the drop was not very far. I hit the stone floor, and rolled, loose-limbed enough that I did myself no harm.</p><p>I turned around slowly, and now, unmistakably, there was the merest glimmer of light, far off, at the end of what seemed another long passageway. Drawn by that light, I set off quickly, almost running.</p><p>Now I could see the dim outline of the rock sides, and the little veins of glitter in them. The passage wound and wound, and the glow deepened and bloodied. Then abruptly I had turned a corner and threw up my hands to shield my eyes.</p><p>The light was as blinding as the darkness, but soon I could rub away the tears and look around me.</p><p>I was in a vast cavern, lit only at its center where a great, rough-hewn bowl, at least six feet in diameter, poured out a ceaseless storm of red and golden flame. Beyond the fire a flight of steps ran up to a narrow door high in the wall. Otherwise the cavern seemed featureless and empty.</p><p>Somehow the narrow door was important to me, and I knew I must reach it.</p><p>I started out across the floor, suddenly aware of how the cavern, stretching up endlessly into darkness, dwarfed me like an ant. I passed the flame-bowl, had my foot on the first stair. There was a groaning thunder behind me. I swung around and looked in astonishment. Countless little fires had cracked open the cavern floor, and were blazing there. At the next step, fresh flames burst through. Not stopping to see any more, I ran to the top of the stairs, as if speed could outwit the mechanism below. With my hand on the narrow door, I glanced back. The floor where I had walked was now a sea of savage gold, and the scarlet smoke clouded up and turned to purple in the high roof. I pushed the door and ran through when it opened, thrusting it shut behind me.</p><p>The room was full of light, though it seemed to have no source. In front of me was a long hanging curtain, and when I pulled it aside, a stone altar and another stone bowl, where something stirred and brooded at my presence. I could not see this thing, only sense it, and when it spoke, I did not hear the words except with the ears inside my head.</p><p>&#x201c;And so you could not sleep forever. I knew that you must wake one day, for all the sleep I gave you. Wake, and come to me. Even the abyss could not take you, as I hoped. Well, then. I will tell you things. I am Karrakaz, the Soulless One, who sprang from the evil of your race, a world of years before your birth, and finally destroyed that race, and everyone of it, except yourself. And you escaped destruction because you were a little child, and had not yet properly learned the ways of evil. But now you have grown to womanhood in your sleep, and you will learn. Evil will come and you will welcome it. Remember, wherever you go, I will be near you. There is no escape from Karrakaz now. Look.&#x201d;</p><p>On the altar something flickered and glittered and took on substance. A knife, with a sharp bright blade.</p><p>&#x201c;See how easy it would be to be rid of me. Pick up the knife. You have only to tell it where to strike, and it will obey you. Then you can sleep forever, without fear.&#x201d;</p><p>But I stood quite still and did not take it. A million pictures and memories were blazing through my mind, and my hands were icy with terror.</p><p>&#x201c;You wish to go out, then? Easy. There is the way. The steps beyond the altar lead upward and out into the world. But if you go, you are cursed, and carry a curse with you; there will be no happiness. The civilization which bred you is dead uncountable years. Your palaces are in ruins. The lizards sun themselves in the dried-up fountains and the fallen courts. And you&#x2014;I will show you to yourself. Recollect, you should have been powerful, a magician who ruled the elements, the stars, the seas, the deep fires of the earth. All things might have done your bidding. The power of flight was yours, the chameleon art, the art of invisibility&#x2014;and beauty. Let me show you what you are.&#x201d;</p><p>The new thing in the air shone coldly clear, and in it I saw my reflection begin to form. A woman-shape, slender, small; long hair, very pale, and then the face&#x2014;the hands of the reflection covered its face, and kept a little of its hideousness from me. But only a little. I knew. The face of a devil, a monster, a mindless thing, unbearable to look on.</p><p>I was crouching low against the floor, one arm over my head, my chin pressed down against my breasts, and, in the other hand, the knife from Karrakaz&#x2019; altar.</p><p>But before I could speak the death words to the blade, a soft lamp filled my brain, cool and green, and very old.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said the no-voice in my skull, &#x201c;there is always that. If you can find it. Your soul-kin of green jade.&#x201d;</p><p>I jumped up and flung the knife through the image of the mirror so that it shattered. Beyond the door a massive explosion rocked the cavern, and the floor juddered under my feet. I started for the steps.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; it said, the he-she thing without a soul. &#x201c;Remember you are cursed, and carry a curse with you. You have been asleep in the depths of a dead volcano. Leave it, and it will wake as you have woken. The red-hot lava will pour out through every passage and pursue you down the mountain. It will cover villages and towns, ruin crops, and burn to death everything living in its path.&#x201d;</p><p>But I scarcely heard. My instinct for freedom was too strong, too terrible. I rushed up the steps, up and up, away from the glowing room and the possession there, into cold darkness that soon lightened. As I paused a moment to rest, leaning against the mountain&#x2019;s gut, I looked up and saw stars and moonlight pouring in my eyes. Behind me the dark was reddening, and rocked with endless paroxysms of anger or pain. The stench of sulfur filled my belly and head and lungs and made me sick, but I toiled on, my hands like limpets on the stone. At last a ledge, and beyond the ledge the outer slopes of the volcano, running downward into dark valleys. Above, wide now from horizon to horizon, the brilliant sky.</p><p>I jumped from the ledge, and, as my feet touched soil, a demon belled in the earth. Sky and earth came toppling together and turned scarlet, and I fell, and continued to fall, down into the night.<br><br></p><p><b>2</b></p><p>I fell faster than I could have run, too stunned to be frightened yet. Then I was in a pit, and was stopped like a heart in death. I crawled out, gazed back. The clouds above the grumbling mountain were russet, and the first bright snakes of lava were sliding forth after me. A shower of boiling coals exploded outward, and fell all around me. Black-ash rain filled my eyes and mouth. I wrapped a corner of the dirty garment I wore over my mouth and nose, and fled again.</p><p>Down to the valleys. No longer dark. Lights were flying here and there and everywhere, and I could hear them screaming and shouting even over the noise the mountain made. There was no hope for them, for myself. Where would any of us hide from this burning demented hatred?</p><p>I was on a road, and scarcely noticed it. I bore away from the first village, ran across an orchard, where already the sparks of the volcano had started a fire. Vines were popping as they blazed. A flock of bleating, terrified sheep came plunging past and were gone.</p><p>I ran on. Where was my instinct taking me?</p><p>Something snapped with a clang; I stumbled and fell. A wicked little trap had bitten shut on the hem of my tunic, by some miracle missing my bare foot. I wrenched the tunic free, tearing it, and saw ahead the low glitter of water.</p><p>A palace pool, clotted with a cream of lilies and swans, dazzled behind my eyes, but the night was crimson now, and the mountain thundered. I got up and ran toward the water. The vines whipped around me. Through a gate, across a furrowed field, smoking in places. All the while, the coals burst over me. A million little blisters were forming on my body, but I scarcely noticed them. Suddenly through a thicket, against the ghastly sky, a long lake stretching wide, its glass changing to red, steaming where the hot things fell in it and went out.</p><p>Stumbling to the edge, I found several moored boats, little fishing canoes. Why hadn&#x2019;t the fools in the villages run to these and saved themselves? I felt helpless anger at them, as I expertly pushed my boat out from the shore, using the long rough pole. I bore the guilt for every one of them to die. And here was the means for them to live, ignored. Damn them, then, let them perish.</p><p>Deep on the heart of the lake, I watched through the night, the imperceptible dawn, while the fury of the mountain expended itself. Around me the water heaved and bubbled, the air was black, hot, and stifled with falling ashes. The sounds were of a great beast vomiting. I thought of the stone Karrakaz had used as its altar, consumed with all the rest, but I knew that that thing at least had survived. It would be always with me, an emblem of the waiting evil in my soul, a reminder of my hideousness, the curse upon me, and the easiness of death.</p><p>At last, a sort of twilight, green and lavender, with one last pulsing cloud above the volcano. I strained the boat across the water to the farthest shore, but even there the land was cinder-fields. In places the ground had cracked open, erupting stones.</p><p>I would have kept away from the cots and huts, but it was so difficult to tell now. Everything was down, trees smoldering in the path. A dead child lay on its face; dead birds had fallen from the air. I began to weep, running frantically in all directions to escape this evidence, but always seeing it. Had my sin come already? Even in my unconquerable desire to be free, had I begun to unlock darkness?</p><p>And now I seemed to be moving down a narrow alleyway between the ruined walls of little houses.</p><p>A corner, swerving sharply, and now an open place. There were about fifty or sixty people huddled together here, their backs to me, ragged and grimy as I was. The sight shocked me. I stopped. A little hot wind hissed through my hair.</p><p>And then they began to turn, singly, in groups, sensing me as a wild animal senses danger or food. Their cold reddened eyes fixed on my body, halted, and turned from my face. I wanted to put up my hands to hide my face, but they were wooden and nailed against my sides. A child began to cry somewhere in the throng. Men shouted and women muttered. Their hands were moving as mine could not, in some ancient ritual; against evil, I thought. Suddenly a new voice rang out, clear, but with a little crack in it.</p><p>&#x201c;The Goddess! The She-One from the Mountain!&#x201d;</p><p>And all about me, as if at a signal, they were falling on their knees, entreating me for mercy, and pity, and succor, and all the things I could not give. Mixed in with their wailing was a cry about their sins, and the word Evess. It came to me abruptly that they were speaking in some language I had never heard, and yet I knew every syllable. Evess meant face, but not in the human sense. This was the face of holiness which to them could be both beautiful and ugly, equally terrible, and must never be looked on. Glancing behind them, I saw what they had been grouped around at the end of the open place: a rough-hewn stone, resembling a woman in a red robe with white clay hair. It held a mask against the Evess, which could not be seen, but the hair and stature of it were unmistakable. These people were big and large-boned, dark-skinned and black-haired. The image was not of them, but they and I knew it at once. It was myself.</p><p>So I stood facing myself across the humped hills of their bodies. I, who had brought the scarlet death of the mountain, worshiped in fear as the ancient goddess some legend had implanted in their minds.</p></p><h2>Sexual Healing: The Complete Guide to Overcoming Common Sexual Problems</h2><p>This expanded edition of <i>Sexual Healing</i> examines every known sexual problem and all possible treatments, including many that are new and experimental.

(By the way, the short answer is no.) A unique blend of travelogue, spirits history, and recipe collection, <i>Boozehound</i> explores the origins of what we drink and the often surprising reasons behind our choices. <br>&nbsp;<br>In lieu of odorless, colorless, tasteless spirits, Wilson champions Old World liquors with hard-to-define flavors&#x2014;a bitter and complex Italian <i>amari</i>, or the ancient, aromatic herbs of Chartreuse, as well as distinctive New World offerings like lively Peruvian pisco. With an eye for adventure, Wilson seeks out visceral experiences at the source of production&#x2014;visiting fields of spiky agave in Jalisco, entering the heavily and reverently-guarded Jï¿½germeister herb room in Wolfenbï¿½ttel, and journeying to the French Alps to determine if mustachioed men in berets really handpick blossoms to make elderflower liqueur. <br>&nbsp;<br>In addition, <i>Boozehound</i> offers more than fifty drink recipes, from three riffs on the Manhattan to cocktail-geek favorites like the Aviation and the Last Word. These recipes are presented alongside a host of opinionated essays that cherish the rare, uncover the obscure, dethrone the overrated, and unravel the mysteries of taste, trends, and terroir. Through his far-flung, intrepid traveling and tasting, Wilson shows us that perhaps nothing else as entwined with the history of human culture is quite as much fun as booze.</p><p>JASON WILSON writes the spirits column for the <i>Washington Post</i>.

The only reason for this is because, in our house, a lonely bottle of sambuca sat at the back of our kitchen pantry, hidden behind the hodgepodge bottles of Chivas Regal, Canadian Club, and VO. My parents didn&#x2019;t drink whiskey&#x2014;they were the type of baby boomers who as young adults had eschewed spirits and cocktails for the pleasures of wine&#x2014;and so they likely kept those bottles on hand solely for guests who liked whiskey. As for why sambuca lurked in a dark corner of our shelf, I have never discovered an explanation. We are not Italian-Americans. It&#x2019;s not as if my parents were jet-setting in Portofino (more like Ocean City, New Jersey). And we&#x2019;d never hosted a foreign exchange student. Perhaps it was a gift from a guest, someone who believed that my parents might enjoy a bracing, licorice-tasting after-dinner spirit? In that case, it was one of the most misguided gifts of all time.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, since this bottle of sambuca sat totally untouched and unmonitored, it ended up being the perfect liquor for a sixteen-year-old boy and his friends. My parents were occasionally out to dinner, and so after the police had broken up a keg party in the woods or on the eleventh hole of the local golf course and we were suddenly out of Milwaukee&#x2019;s Best, my friends and I would find ourselves rummaging deep in my family&#x2019;s pantry for our now-favorite Italian digestivo.<br>&nbsp;<br>If we&#x2019;d had any choice, I doubt sambuca would have been at the top of the list. After all, most American kids grow up calling red Twizzlers &#x201c;licorice&#x201d; and picking around the black jelly beans in the jar. My friends thought sambuca was gross, and we mainly drank it in shots. But I kind of liked it. Or at least I pretended to like it. I don&#x2019;t mean to suggest that I had esoteric tastes as a teenager. In reality, I was a rube who subsisted on Gatorade and Ho Hos, gagged on mustard, and scraped the onions or mushrooms off any dish served with them. But I had seen La Dolce Vita on VCR tape, and I took on an air of sambuca connoisseurship as if I&#x2019;d just returned from cafï¿½ life on the Via Veneto, splashing in the Trevi Fountain with Anita Ekberg, and now had a Vespa parked in the garage next to our riding mower.<br>&nbsp;<br>The reason was quite simple: L., a certain Valkyrie-like girl who&#x2019;d recently moved to our neighborhood and started hanging out with us. Her mother had an accent, and everyone said they were &#x201c;European.&#x201d; They had a last name that seemed vaguely Scandinavian or, as some in the neighborhood called it, &#x201c;sort of Aryan.&#x201d; But who knows where they came from. Regardless, the stunning blond-haired, blue-eyed L. was clearly different from most of the Jersey girls who went to high school with me. I was smitten, and had spent an entire summer trying to convince her to fall in love with me, but had remained squarely in the friend zone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Still, I was on the lookout for ways to impress her. One autumn night, a group of us fled a busted party on the golf course. &#x201c;Sambuca, anyone?&#x201d; I suggested. Among our friends, L. and I walked to my house, cozily arm-in-arm in the crisp fall air. On that night, I decided to make my move.<br>&nbsp;<br>The sambuca bottle had one of those plastic pourer spouts. After so much usage&#x2014;since we didn&#x2019;t really know how to use it properly and never wiped it off&#x2014;a sugary crust began to form, making it increasingly hard to pour. As luck would have it, on that very night the crust had finally grown impenetrable; I couldn&#x2019;t even coax a trickle of sambuca from the spout. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the deal?&#x201d; my friends wanted to know. &#x201c;We want shots!&#x201d; L. joined the chorus. Panicked, seeing my moment slipping away from me, I began hacking away at the crust with a butter knife. When that didn&#x2019;t work, I grabbed a pencil from the kitchen counter and jammed it, forcefully, into the spout. The pencil immediately broke in two, and the top part somehow ended up floating inside the sambuca bottle.<br>&nbsp;<br>My friends erupted in laughter. L. did, too. I was eventually able to pour the shots, but by then&#x2014;humiliated in the way only a love-struck teenage boy can be&#x2014;I&#x2019;d lost my nerve and pride. When, later, I embarrassingly, tearfully, professed my undying affection to L., she gently patted me on the head and told me I was &#x201c;a good friend.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The only other thing I remember from that night is my mother dragging me to my bedroom by the ear, yelling at me. Apparently, my parents found me passed out in the kitchen in my boxers, and I would be grounded for quite some time. Fortunately (or unfortunately), my brother had earlier stashed the sambuca bottle safely in its regular hiding spot. Years later, well after I&#x2019;d graduated from college, my mother was clearing out the pantry and found it. She remained puzzled as to why there was a broken pencil floating inside a half-empty bottle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Soon after, L. began dating a guy in his twenties with a classic Mustang who drove around town with photos of L. in his hubcaps as a sign of affection&#x2014;pretty much a deal maker in 1980s suburban New Jersey. Of course, I was crushed. This was my first true romantic heartbreak, and its sting was so acute that I can vividly recall the feeling more than twenty years later. What could I do? I was still a boy, and no match for a dangerous older man with a Mustang. Stealing that sambuca, gagging down the overwhelming 80-proof anise liqueur&#x2014;this was about as edgy as I got in those days.<br>&nbsp;<br>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s a curious thing about memorable flavors. They always come back.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I began writing my column, one of the first big spirits stories I covered was the legalization of absinthe. Until 2007, the mythic, louche liqueur of nineteenth-century Parisian decadence was classified as a dangerous, potentially hallucinogenic, and banned substance by the U.S. government. The reason it had always been verboten was because of a chemical called thujone, the active ingredient in wormwood. Wormwood is the mysterious plant that makes absinthe absinthe&#x2014;the Green Fairy, with its legends of hallucination and belle ï¿½poque debauchery embraced by writers and artists such as Verlaine, Baudelaire, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Modigliani. By the turn of the twentieth century, absinthe was so popular that the French were drinking thirty-six billion liters of absinthe versus only five billion liters of wine. But then in 1905, some crazy guy in Switzerland named Jean Lanfray, drunk on absinthe, murdered his family&#x2014;which led to a public outcry against the spirit. One by one, Western nations began banning absinthe. Some historians suggest it was actually the powerful French wine industry, concerned about its eroding market, that helped trump up the Lanfray murder and lobbied for the Green Fairy&#x2019;s prohibition. Regardless, by 1912 absinthe was illegal in the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>But here&#x2019;s the thing: absinthe was never banned by name. In the United States, the law expressly prohibits any spirit that contains over ten parts per million of thujone. It took nearly a century, but in the late 2000s, someone suddenly had the bright idea to apply a little modern chemistry to the issue. A New Orleans&#x2013;born chemist named Ted Breaux was creating a new absinthe called Lucid, and he began testing bottles from the late nineteenth century to show that properly made absinthe contained very little thujone. He proved that just about all absinthe, both historical and contemporary, had less than ten parts per million of thujone. The whole thujone scare appeared to be overblown, and the ban existed mainly because, until 2007, there had been no way to prove absinthe&#x2019;s innocence. The U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau did similar tests and came to the same conclusion. The ban had been misapplied. Voila! Americans were now free to drink absinthe.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over the next twelve months, absinthe seemed very much in demand, dovetailing with another new fad for classic, speakeasy-era cocktails. The New York Times, in December 2007, announced &#x201c;A Liquor of Legend Makes a Comeback.&#x201d; Nearly every lifestyle publication followed suit, championing the obscure, notorious spirit&#x2019;s return. By the end of 2008, at least a half dozen premium absinthe brands had come on the market, most selling for more than sixty dollars a bottle, including one called Mansinthe created by Marilyn Manson. You knew the inevitable backlash was only a matter of time, but even jaded observers had to be surprised at just how swiftly the cognoscenti gave the official Thumbs Down on poor old absinthe.<br>&nbsp;<br>The first New York Times Sunday Styles section of 2009 declared absinthe &#x201c;uncool,&#x201d; with Styles reporter Eric Konigsberg calling it &#x201c;falsely subversive&#x201d; and likening absinthe to such fleeting cultural fads as cigar bars, soul patches, women&#x2019;s lower-back tattoos, brushed-nickel kitchen fixtures, and &#x201c;blogging about one&#x2019;s bikini grooming.&#x201d; He wrote, &#x201c;Once the naughty aura of the forbidden fruit is removed, all that remains is a grasp at unearned sophistication.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The San Francisco Chronicle&#x2019;s Food section was more blunt, calling absinthe &#x201c;out&#x201d; in its 2009 New Year&#x2019;s predictions. Harsher still: &#x201c;We liked it much better when it was illegal. Somehow the notion of being illicit overrides the flavor of NyQuil dripping down your throat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>As I observed this phenomenon, I thought, &#x201c;Well, duh.&#x201d; Americans mostly don&#x2019;t like the taste of licorice. Absinthe is flavored with anise, giving it a strong licorice taste. These two basic truths pretty much ensured that the spirit would never be enduringly popular in the United States. So presenting the sleight-of-hand notion that absinthe was ever &#x201c;cool&#x201d; before being reported as &#x201c;uncool&#x201d;&#x2014;essentially hyping absinthe, then twelve months later calling it overhyped&#x2014;is breathtakingly shallow even by the usual standards of lifestyle journalism. It smacks of high school.<br>&nbsp;<br>But maybe this makes sense. There&#x2019;s always been a whiff of adolescence when it comes to Americans and absinthe, a teenage sort of longing to experience something thrilling and subversive&#x2014;drama followed by the callow need to point out, Holden Caulfield&#x2013;like, just how phoney it all is. <br>&nbsp;<br>I can empathize. I first tasted absinthe while on a magazine assignment in the late 1990s, in Barcelona at a dive called Bar Marsella. &#x201c;An absinthe or two at Bar Marsella&#x201d; was firmly established as one of the Lonely Planet guide&#x2019;s &#x201c;highlights&#x201d; of the city, and the crowd was a typical mishmash of backpackerish tourists from around the globe. Sure, some Moroccan guys tried to sell me hash outside. Sure, the bartender physically tossed two pickpockets out the door. And sure, that bartender was a dodgy, middle-aged American guy named Scotty, a six-foot-two, well-over-two-hundred-pound, red-haired man who wore pink shirts, who referred to himself as &#x201c;Super Queer,&#x201d; who claimed to be a former child actor, and who refused to tell me his last name because &#x201c;as far as you&#x2019;re concerned, I don&#x2019;t have a last name.&#x201d; Yet for the most part, Bar Marsella was &#x201c;sketchy&#x201d; only in a safe, air-quotes sort of way. During my twenties, I&#x2019;d vaguely imagined myself as some sort of romantic flï¿½neur, a Eurotrash-loving vagabond hanging out in seedy bars, like Rimbaud. In reality, my first sip of absinthe took place when I was a marginally employed twenty-nine-year-old writing an article for an airline in-flight magazine. The letdown was unavoidable.<br>&nbsp;<br>Had I paid better attention in high school English class, I would have read of this type of anise-flavored disappointment from an earlier chronicler of subversive lifestyle trends, one Ernest Hemingway&#x2014;once again in &#x201c;Hills Like White Elephants,&#x201d; as the quarreling couple finally taste their glasses of anï¿½s.<br><br>&#x201c;It tastes like licorice,&#x201d; the girl said and put the glass down.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the way with everything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said the girl. &#x201c;Everything tastes of licorice. Especially all the things you&#x2019;ve waited so long for, like absinthe.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It may be true. That&#x2019;s not to say that the actual absinthe, in the glass, was bad. It was enjoyable, particularly when you drizzled the water over the sugar cube and through the slotted spoon. But by that point in my life, I&#x2019;d already experienced enough licorice-tasting firewaters to have an idea of what to expect. Absinthe, in reality, just seemed like a stronger, more bitter, more herbal version of the sambuca I&#x2019;d snuck out of my parents&#x2019; liquor cabinet. And by comparison, my old act of stealing the sambuca had its own small but genuine element of subversiveness. No matter how much I wanted to feel edgy or illicit sitting in a seedy bar in Barcelona years later, how could legally purchased absinthe ever compare to stolen sambuca? Even Rimbaud had moved beyond his absinthe-drinking flï¿½neur stage by the age of nineteen: having shocked the bourgeoisie quite enough for one lifetime, he never wrote another line of poetry.<br>&nbsp;<br>Viewed this way, the idea that you could ever hope to sustain the imagination of adults with a sixty-dollar bottle of absinthe becomes absurd. Sure, many will purchase a bottle and try it&#x2014;once&#x2014;out of curiosity: Will it make me hallucinate? Will I become a decadent anarchist and write Symbolist poetry? Will I cut my own ear off, like Van Gogh? When none of that happens and they realize they don&#x2019;t really like licorice, they&#x2019;ll shove the bottle into the back of their liquor cabinet, where it will languish for the next decade or so. My advice to these people&#x2019;s future children: if the absinthe bottle has a pourer spout, don&#x2019;t try to unclog it with a pencil.</p><h2>Victorian America: Transformations in Everyday Life, 1876-1915 (The Everyday Life in America Series, Vol. 4)</h2><p><strong></strong><p><strong>A valuable and compelling portrait of the daily life of Americans during the Victorian era--the fourth volume in the Everyday Life in America series </strong></p></p><p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>Moving</b></p><p>Migration and movement, mobility and motion characterized identity in Victorian America. A country in transition was also in transit. Everyone seemed en route: emigrating and immigrating, removing or being removed, resettling and relocating, in many directions--east to west, south to north, rural to urban, urban to suburban. In American slang, "going places" came to mean a geographic as well as a social destination. Movement so touched this American era that it deserves to be treated first in any survey of its everyday life. </p><p>An overseas diaspora marked the personal history of a quarter of Americans living in 1915. These "new" immigrants figure prominently in the national image of the period, an age of unprecedented immigration and one immortalized in two national symbols: the Statue of Liberty (1886) and Ellis Island (1892). Immigration entailed both departure and destination. The rupture of traditional everyday life--relocation from familiar surroundings, separation from kinfolk, the experience of becoming a foreigner and ceasing to belong--took a toll that will never be completely knowable. </p><p>America also experienced continual internal migration, causing Norwegian novelist, Knut Hamsun, to note, "Everyday is moving day . . . The population is only half-settled."1 Treks westward took every conceivable form: Arizona land runs, Yukon gold rushes, California dreams. Flights out of the South took blacks to northern cities and whites to the Southwest plains. Midwesterners, in a revolt from the village, poured into Milwaukee and Minneapolis, Cleveland and Chicago. </p><p>Movement increased on the margin as well as in the mainstream. Vagrants, squatters, and regiments of unemployed workers, took to the roads; some (for instance, Coxey's Army in 1893-94) marched on Washington (figure 1.9) to dramatize their plight. Paradoxically, as homeless, landless, and jobless Americans roamed city streets in the 1890s, other citizens took to traveling about on annual vacations. </p><p>Some Americans were moved against their will or prevented from moving. American Indian nations were systematically removed to (usually western) reservations. Nativists, a half million strong in the American Protective Association in 1894, clamored that some foreigners ought to be excluded or restricted in their movements, particularly if they were Orientals, Jews, or Catholics. Jim Crow laws sought to keep blacks in their place.</p><br> <p><i>Immigrants and Emigrants</i></p><br><p><b>Arrivals: Europe, Asia, and the Americas</b></p><p>Immigration officials, nativists, and social reformers often turned to statistics to demonstrate the massive influx of newcomers. For example, the U.S. Department of Labor mounted an "electrical diagram" at the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition that furnished spectators with extensive data on the "races of alien arrivals; occupations of those persons admitted; causes of exclusion; and arrests and deportations by classes."2 The display noted that before the Civil War, the banner year for new immigrants was 1854, when 427,833 people arrived. A new peak was reached in 1882, when 788,992 entered. However, in the early twentieth century the annual influx passed the million mark six times, and in 1907 the figure rose to 1,285,349.</p><p>Many who came after the 1880s were labeled "new immigrants" because they differed from those who previously emigrated largely from northern and western Europe. The outflow of Italians, Greeks, Slovaks, Poles, Russians, Austro-Hungarians, as well as people from the Orient (first the Chinese, then the Japanese and the Filipinos) and from Mexico diversified everyday American life. These new immigrants differed in religious background, for many were Greek Orthodox, Buddhist, or Roman Catholic, entering a basically Protestant society; a large segment were Russian and Polish Jews. The new immigrants spoke numerous languages and were generally poorer and less educated and more differentiated in color and culture than were the earlier immigrants. </p><p>In focusing only upon national statistics and ethnic diversity, historians often lose sight of emigrating and immigrating as personal historical acts. Why did individuals or families decide to go or to stay? How did they journey? Did they feel uprooted or transplanted? How did their everyday lives change? </p><p>In summarizing the European experience, John Bodnar suggests a combination of factors that prompted people to leave: the commercialization of agriculture, the decline of craft work, changes in landownership patterns, expansion of the population, and major shifts in the financial and market conditions of capitalism. To be sure, the familiar imponderables--wanderlust, adventure, family problems--played their part, but most of those who moved did so because they were "pragmatically adjusting their goals and behavior throughout the nineteenth century to meet the changing economic realities in Europe as well as opportunities in America." </p><p>Most emigrant streams Bodnar identifies followed one of two courses. Skilled artisans and independent farmers, threatened by the factory production of cheap goods and by the commercialization of agriculture, left first. Hoping to avoid the "further decline in social and economic status, they usually possessed modest financial resources, left in family units, and were less likely to return." As a pioneer wave, they "exercised leadership and influence in American ethnic communities." A second group, larger in size and poorer in status, "consisted of marginal land owners who hoped to earn enough to return and increase their holdings," the children of such owners, and those with no real property. This second group was comprised more of individuals than of family groupings and, at least initially, their intent often was to come to America to earn money that would allow them to improve their life once they returned to Europe. Whatever their plans, most immigrants set out well prepared for their journeys. Through kinship networks, labor agents, and other intermediaries, as well as emigrants' guides and maps, most had amassed a wealth of detailed information, before departing, concerning exactly where they wanted to go and how to get there.3 </p><p>Emigrants first journeyed to a major seaport, such as Liverpool, Hamburg, Le Havre, Bremen, or Antwerp. Once they were there, numerous decisions had to be made: which baggage runners, boardinghouse keepers, and provisioners to trust; which border officials, emigration officers, and government bureaucrats to placate; and which tickets, sailing routes, and accommodations to purchase.</p>From Schlereth (American Studies/Notre Dame): a detailed, lively survey of the commonplace objects, events, experiences, products, and tastes that comprised America's Victorian culture, expressed its values, and shaped modern life. Between the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 and the San Francisco one in 1915, the US population doubled, redistributed itself, and developed the character and lifestyle identified with the middle classes in the 20th century. Its mobility required roads, trains, trolleys, maps, canals, autos; new means of communication in telephones, telegraphs, and mass media; and a standard time devised by railroads and measured by alarm clocks, time clocks, and cheap watches. New economic systems emerged: farms were commercialized; foods were processed (Kellogg's), condensed (Borden's), preserved (Heinz), distributed in food chains (A&amp;P), promoted through advertising, and identified with brand names and slogans. New occupations emerged; typewriters created secretaries who cultivated new standards of personal appearance wearing shirtwaists, using cosmetics, shopping in department stores, and visiting beauty parlors. Toothpaste, razor blades, health foods, and spas expressed the rising interest in personal fitness as well as recreation, which extended to moving pictures, spectator sports, public gardens, amusement parks, and bicycles--all based on the new technologies, on the new vision of people mastering nature. But the book is not all trivia, not just the Juicy Fruit gum and the cafeteria-eating that Americans discovered at the San Francisco Fair. Schlereth, a writer of immense tact and range, recounts with equal interest and vitality the whole constellation of events that surrounded the development of suburban living, domestic history, the labor movement, the architecture of colleges--and conveys it seamlessly. The notes reveal something of his erudition, his ability to see the relationships, to depict unpretentiously this complex period of cultural history with all its ironies and color.

Her bleak and brutal world, limned with the sparest of detail, forges her character: stoic, cynical, with burning compassion at the core; in contrast, the rich and mosaic (if capricious and violent) underworld overflows with symbol and metaphor that tease at deeper meanings never made fully explicit. Meanwhile, the nameless ghost&#x2019;s history, told through disconnected snatches of memory, encompasses heroism, abuse, friendship, and betrayal in a tragedy only redeemed by the heart-rending convergence of their separate narratives. Names (and their absence) form a constant leitmotif, as identity is transformed by the act of claiming it.<br>Difficult, provocative, and unforgettable the most dangerous kind of fiction"<br> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)<br><br> Young adults will be able to relate to Wasp&#x2019;s inner turmoil and her battle to understand a world full of inexplicable hatred and violence.

Unfortunately, such improvement is also very expensive. Professional woodworker Tolpin shows how to build and install cabinets and, to a lesser degree, covers kitchen design and laminate countertop construction. The author's straightforward text, combined with numerous photographs and illustrations, should enable most woodworkers to make their own cabinetry. Other types of storage furniture can be made using information gleaned from this source.

Beginning at the regime&#x2019;s high point in his Year 12, it traces the subsequent collapse that saw the deaths of many of the king&#x2019;s loved ones, his attempts to guarantee the revolution through co-rulers, and the last frenzied assault on the god Amun. <br>The book then outlines the events of the subsequent five decades that saw the extinction of the royal line, an attempt to place a foreigner on Egypt&#x2019;s throne, and the accession of three army officers in turn. Among its conclusions are that the mother of Tutankhamun was none other than Nefertiti, and that the queen was joint-pharaoh in turn with both her husband Akhenaten and her son. As such, she was herself instrumental in beginning the return to orthodoxy, undoing her erstwhile husband&#x2019;s life-work before her own mysterious disappearance.<br>This fully updated and extensively revised paperback edition addresses new evidence and discussions that have appeared in the decade since the book was originally published.

The diet of the modern American wasn't always as corporate, conglomerated, and corn-rich as it is today, and the style of American cooking, along with the ingredients that compose it, has never been fixed. With a cast of characters including bold inventors, savvy restaurateurs, ruthless advertisers, mad scientists, adventurous entrepreneurs, celebrity chefs, and relentless health nuts, Smith pins down the truly crackerjack history behind the way America eats.<br><br>Smith's story opens with early America, an agriculturally independent nation where most citizens grew and consumed their own food. Over the next two hundred years, however, Americans would cultivate an entirely different approach to crops and consumption. Advances in food processing, transportation, regulation, nutrition, and science introduced highly complex and mechanized methods of production. The proliferation of cookbooks, cooking shows, and professionally designed kitchens made meals more commercially, politically, and culturally potent. To better understand these trends, Smith delves deeply and humorously into their creation. Ultimately he shows how, by revisiting this history, we can reclaim the independent, locally sustainable roots of American food.</p><p>The diet of the modern American wasn&#39;t always as corporate, conglomerated, and corn-rich as it is today, and the style of American cooking, along with the ingredients that compose it, has never been fixed.

From [his] remarkable early short story collections . . . through his beautifully nuanced stories of family life [and] the bittersweet humors of middle age and beyond . . . John Updike has created a body of work in the notoriously difficult form of the short story to set beside those of these distinguished American predecessors. Congratulations and heartfelt thanks are due to John Updike for having brought such pleasure and such illumination to so many readers for so many years.&#x201d;</p><p>""He is a religious writer; he is a comic realist; he knows what everything feels like, how everything works. He is putting together a body of work which in substantial intelligent creation will eventually be seen as second to none in our time."<br>--William H. Pritchard, The Hudson Review, reviewing Museums and Women (1972) <br>A harvest and not a winnowing, "The Early Stories preserves almost all of the short fiction John Updike published between 1954 and 1975. <br>The stories are arranged in eight sections, of which the first, "Olinger Stories," already appeared as a paperback in 1964; in its introduction, Updike described Olinger, Pennsylvania, as "a square mile of middle-class homes physically distinguished by a bend in the central avenue that compels some side streets to deviate from the grid pattern." These eleven tales, whose heroes age from ten to over thirty but remain at heart Olinger boys, are followed by groupings titled "Out in the World," "Married Life," and "Family Life," tracing a common American trajectory. Family life is disrupted by the advent of "The Two Iseults," a bifurcation originating in another small town, Tarbox, Massachusetts, where the Puritan heritage co-exists with post-Christian morals. "Tarbox Tales" are followed by "Far Out," a group of more or less experimental fictions on the edge of domestic space, and "The Single Life," whose protagonists are unmarried and unmoored. <br>Of these one hundred three stories, eighty first appeared in "The New Yorker, and the other twenty-three in journals from the enduring "Atlantic Monthly and "Harper's to the defunct "Big Table and" Transatlantic Review. All show Mr. Updike's wit and verbal felicity, his reverencefor ordinary life, and his love of the transient world. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p><b>John Updike</b> was born in Shillington, Pennsylvania, in 1932.

Though he'll admit that book writing isn't easy, this venture marks another feather in his tasteful cap. A precursor of sorts to his new series on Bravo, Tim Gunn's Guide to Style, this accessible guidebook covers it all, including the "hunt," "stalk" and "pounce" of "shopping at its most instinctual" (inspired by cheap, forward-looking clothiers H&amp;M), what to ask yourself before taking advantage of a bargain (is it season-appropriate?), the difference between a fashion icon and a mentor (Gunn's the former, Coco Chanel the latter) and full-on closet reconstruction. Gunn's friendly, conversational prose will give readers the feeling of a face-to-face encounter, and Runway fans will be happy to find Gunn hasn't abandoned his colorful metaphors (shopping as "safari") and 50-cent words ("insouciant"). Whether revealing the secrets of "The Under Arsenal" or ruminating on the "tone" and "diction" of a handbag, Gunn's text is clever, a touch waggish, and highly practical for both ensemble mavens and fashion criminals. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He explains the sensory network of the nose and its effect on the subtle channels of energy throughout the body, showing the direct link between the practice of conscious breathing and the electrochemical balance of the brain and nervous system.

Set in Makokoba, a black township, in the late l940s, the novel is an intensely bittersweet love story. When Fumbatha, a construction worker, meets the much younger Phephelaphi, he"wants her like the land beneath his feet from which birth had severed him." He in turn fills her "with hope larger than memory." But Phephelaphi is not satisfied with their "one-room" love alone. The qualities that drew Fumbatha to her, her sense of independence and freedom, end up separating them. And the closely woven fabric of township life, where everyone knows everyone else, has a mesh too tight and too intricate to allow her to escape her circumstances on her own.</p><p>Vera exploits language to peel away the skin of public and private lives.

An expectation. They play a refrain on handmade guitars; lovers with tender shoulders and strong fists and cold embraces. Birds coo from slanting asbestos roofs. Butterflies break from disused Raleigh bicycle bells. In the air is the sound of a sickle cutting grass along the roadside where black men bend their backs in the sun and hum a tune, and fume, and lullaby. They are clad in torn white shorts, short sleeves, with naked soles. The grass burns over their palms where they reach over and pull at it, then curve over the sickle and beyond, pull, inward, and edge the grass forward with the left palm. They bend it toward the left shoulder and away from the eyes. Sweat drips like honey over the firm length of the arms tearingand tugging and splitting the grass. Often they manage to pull the roots out of the ground; to free something; to conquer a stubbornness; to see what is below; to touch what keeps something alive and visible. Sharp rays of the sun drop along the sharp curve, and flow along the rotating glint of the silver sickle. The arm agile, the arm quick over the grass. The tall grass sweeps across the length of their curved bodies, above their bowed shoulders, and throws a cascade of already dry seeds over their bare arms. The grass is a thin slippery tarnish as it waves smoothly. It sways away and again away in this current of heated air. There are seeds, light and flat, like tiny baked insects. Falling down, with their surfaces rough, flat. They waft into the thickness of grass. Each motion of the arms, eyes, of the entire body is patiently guided. The palms are bleeding with the liquid from freshly squeezed grass. The brow is perpetually furrowed, constricted against this action, and against another, remembered; against regret for a possible inaction, and against each memory that dares not be understood. A silence, perhaps, or something near and anticipated but not yet done. There is waiting. Their supple but unwilling arms turn, loop, and merge with the shiny tassels of the golden grass whose stems are still green, like newborn things, and held firmly to the earth. The movement of their arms is like weaving, as their arms thread through each thicket, and withdraw. This careful motion is patterned like a dance spreading out, each sequence rises like hope enacted and set free. Freed, stroke after stroke, holding briskly, and then a final whisper of release. The grass falls. Arm and arm and arm of it. It falls near and close to each curled body. The grass submits to the feet of the workers who step over it to arrive where the grass is high and stands defiant. They hug it indifferently, concerned only to keep its tassels from their eyes, spreading it away. With an easyease they escape the fine flutter of dry seeds raining downward. The men cut and pull. Cut and pull. They bend, cut, and pull. It is necessary to sing. They cut and level the grass till the sun is a crusty and golden distance away and throws cool rays over their worn arms, and the sky dims, and everything is quiet except the spray of light breaking and darting between the grass tossing back and forth above their foreheads and above their eyes now filled with fatigue. The grass is swishing hopelessly below the shoulder, under the armpit, grazing the elbow, and its sound folds into a faint melody which dims with the slow dying of the sun, and each handful of grass becomes a violent silhouette: a stubborn shadow grasped. The men twist the grass together and roll it into a large mass, stacks of it, and gather it into heavy mounds to be carried away the following day. Their bare soles grate against the stubble now dotting the ground, raised like needles, and where the grass is completely dried, turning to fierce thorns. The men, adapted to challenges more debilitating than these, discover welcoming crevices, empty patches where the grass has been completely uprooted and the soil turned to its cooler side. So they place their soles to safety, their heels to a mild earth. The work is not their own: it is summoned. The time is not theirs: it is seized. The ordeal is their own. They work again and again, and in unguarded moments of hunger and surprise, they mistake their fate for fortune. As for healing, they have music, its curing harmony as sudden as it is sustained. It is swinging like heavy fruit on a low and loose branch, the fruit touching ground with every movement of the wind: they call it Kwela. It is a searing musical moment, swinging in and away, loud and small, lively, living. Within this music, they soar higher than clouds; sink deeper than stones in water. When the branch finally breaks and the fruit cracks its shell, the taste of the fruit is divine. This is Kwela. Embracing choices that are already decided. Deciding which circumstance has been omitted and which set free, which one claimed, which one marked, branded, and owned. The beauty of eyelids closing; a hand closing; and a memory collapsing. Kwela means to climb into the waiting police Jeeps. This word alone has been fully adapted to do marvelous things. It can carry so much more than a word should be asked to carry; rejection, distaste, surrender, envy. And full desire. Trust lovers to nurture hope till it festers. Always wounded by something--a word, a hope, a possibility. After all, they are the kind of people to get caught by barbed-wire fences. A part of them calcifies, dries, and falls off without anyone noticing or raising alarm. Bulawayo is this kind of city and inside is Makokoba Township where Kwela seeks strand after strand of each harsh illusion and makes it new. Sidojiwe E2, the longest street in Makokoba, is fresh with all kinds of desperate wounds. Bulawayo, only fifty years old, has nothing to offer but surprise; being alive is a consolation. Bulawayo is not a city for idleness. The idea is to live within the cracks. Unnoticed and unnoticeable, offering every service but with the capacity to vanish when the task required is accomplished. So the black people learn how to move through the city with speed and due attention, to bow their heads down and slide past walls, to walk without making the shadow more pronounced than the body or the body clearer than the shadow. It means leaning against some masking reality--they lean on walls, on lies, on music. One can always be swallowed by a song. The people walk in the city without encroaching on the pavements from which they are banned. It is difficult, but they manage to crawl to their destination hidden by umbrellas and sun hats which are handed down to them for exactly this purpose, or which they discover, abandoned, at bus stations. They understand something about limits and the desire that thisbuilds in the body. Their bodies long for flight, not surrender, simply the need to leap over the limit quickly and smoothly without bringing attention to oneself. This they do, often and well. After all, they are the ones who keep the pavements clean and sweep the entire city. They have the duty by virtue of their own humility and obedience to pick up the white men fallen on the pavements while the door swings open, once more, from the smoke-filled taverns, and voices are heard briefly before the door swings back in. They help these men into an upright and respectable position, then lead them into solid black cars. Then they spit on the pavements and move on. When they arrive back in Makokoba, Sidojiwe E2 is flooded with Kwela music. The feet feeling free. Hostilities too burdensome to give up. There is a search in the narrow gutters for passions and separations. The people smoke burned-out stubs and tone their fingernails with nicotine, and lovers mourn with joyful release. We do it together. This and that--fight, escape, surrender. The distinctions always unclear, the boundaries perpetually widening. Kwela music brings a symphony of understanding, then within that, other desperate confusions. Poverty prevails over innocence. In such times, a song is a respite. Dying in your sleep. Not once, but several times. Fleeing from an image reflected from translucent shop windows. And then, again, sleep. Afterward, a brief resolve not to bend. Then saying yes. Kwela strips you naked. Anything that reminds of pride can be forgotten in the emptiness introduced. A claim abandoned. A lover lost. It is the body addressed in its least of possible heights. A stone thrust. The knees down and the baton falls across the neck and shoulders. Kwela. Climb on. Move. Turn or twist or ... move. No pause is allowed, and no expectation of grace. Kwela. Cut, pull, bend. It is necessary to sing. Then one chaotic evening the word is pulled back from the police Jeep by whoever is listening in sleep as a car tire digs along Sidojiwe E2.It is freedom and style and survival with no fear of flight or stagnation. This is the city and the pulse of possessing desire. Something that can be recovered, must be restored. Even if it may now be frayed or torn. It has to be put back somewhere where there could be a hint of belonging fastened on somebody. If not freedom then rhythm. Patience is abandoned and something else witnessed: a raised eyelid; a handshake; fingers snapping. Then slow courtship under the tall trees which divide the houses from the red roofs of the police camps. These trees have been brought from faraway lands. They are the sort of trees which do not seem to need water, or when they do, send tentacles that burrow deep, no matter how hard the ground. With no regard whatsoever for the lack of pliable soil, or absent drops of edible rain. Underneath these trees, the lovers stand forlorn in the cluster of large silver-and-white peelings which are curled among the thin pointed leaves now fallen, where forked roots break the earth. The dead leaves cling to their tinge of green, resisting their separation from the tree. A shell expands, dries. Pods explode and spread black rounded seeds to the ground. The seeds have hard surfaces, with gray veins. So tall, these trees, firm and impossible. They look as though they have been built by hand to carry improper histories. A strong scent rises from the base of the tree, from the roots perhaps, like a fading dream. A beautiful, precious, remembered scent. Wafting and vanishing like a mist. The trees make the search for love good by their strong presence and brief odor. In the night--moonshine, words, a happy tune, fate, and distance are shared. The lovers bask in immaculate dreams. Kwela includes the harmonies one can name, and misname. There is night. Kwela in daylight is incessantly bold. No parting or other phenomenon of rupture. Some fighting. A slap and a slash and more Kwela. Torn leather shoes rubbing against cement. Tar melting in the hot sun as though newly spread. The sanitary lane carries the secrecy and stenchwhich envelopes the waste of every character--wasted time, wasted love, wasted this and that. Time flips like a tossed coin and in the luster and swinging surprise it is nothing on a single day to hear a thief leap over hedges on Sidojiwe E2 and by noon to listen to bicycle bells in the city center. There copper coins crash and jingle onto the pavement as they are swept out in the early hours of the morning from empty city taverns which have NO BLACKS signs, WHITES ONLY signs, and CLOSED signs which say OPEN on the flip side signs and dangle CLOSED from ornate door handles, and outside ... There is music.

Along with his contemporaries Callimachus and Theocritus, Apollonius refashioned Greek poetry to meet the interests and aesthetics of a Hellenistic audience, especially that of Alexandria in the Ptolemaic period following Alexander&#x2019;s death. In this carefully crafted work of 5,835 hexameter verses in four books, the author draws on the preceding literary traditions of epic (Homer), lyric (Pindar), and tragedy (especially Euripides) but creates an innovative and complex narrative that includes geography, religion, ethnography, mythology, adventure, exploration, human psychology, and, most of all, the coming of age and love affair of Jason and Medea. It greatly influenced Roman authors such as Catullus, Virgil, and Ovid, and was imitated by Valerius Flaccus.</p><p>This new edition of the first volume in the Loeb Classical Library offers a fresh translation and improved text.</p></p><p>The aim of the series remains that of including the works of all the principal classical authors.

He became a teacher of grammar at Tagaste, and lived much under the influence of his mother and his friend Alypius. About 383 he went to Rome and soon after to Milan as a teacher of rhetoric, being now attracted by the philosophy of the Sceptics and of the Neo-Platonists. His studies of Paul's letters with Alypius and the preaching of Bishop Ambrose led in 386 to his rejection of all sensual habits and to his famous conversion from mixed beliefs to Christianity. He returned to Tagaste and there founded a religious community. In 395 or 396 he became Bishop of Hippo, and was henceforth engrossed with duties, writing and controversy. He died at Hippo during the successful siege by the Vandals.</p><p>From Augustine's large output the Loeb Classical Library offers that great autobiography the <i>Confessions</i> (in two volumes); <i>On the City of God</i> (seven volumes), which unfolds God's action in the progress of the world's history, and propounds the superiority of Christian beliefs over pagan in adversity; and a selection of <i>Letters</i> which are important for the study of ecclesiastical history and Augustine's relations with other theologians.</p></p><p><p>George Englert McCracken (1904&#x2013;1986) was Professor of Classical Languages at Drake University.</p></p><h2>The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb</h2><p>Controversial in nature, this book demonstrates that the United States did not need to use the atomic bomb against Japan.

Sometime partner of the eccentric Howard Hughes, drinking buddy of William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway, an inveterate gambler and a notorious liar, Hawks was the most modern of the great masters and one of the first directors to declare his independence from the major studios. He played Svengali to Lauren Bacall, Montgomery Clift, and others, but Hawks&#39;s greatest creation may have been himself. As The Atlantic Monthly noted, &#34;Todd McCarthy . . . has gone further than anyone else in sorting out the truths and lies of the life, the skills and the insight and the self-deceptions of the work.&#34; &#34;A fluent biography of the great director, a frequently rotten guy but one whose artistic independence and standards of film morality never failed.&#34; -- The New York Times Book Review; &#34;Hawks&#39;s life, until now rather an enigma, has been put into focus and made one with his art in Todd McCarthy&#39;s wise and funny Howard Hawks.&#34; -- The Wall Street Journal; &#34;Excellent . . . a respectful, exhaustive, and appropriately smartass look at Hollywood&#39;s most versatile director.&#34; -- Newsweek.</p><p>A New York Times Notable Book of the Year <p>Howard Hawks is now regarded as one of the greatest directors ever to work in Hollywood. His career stretched from the silent era through the seventies and left an indelible stamp on American cinema. A filmmaker of incomparable versatility, he made the landmark gangster film Scarface, aviation classics (The Dawn Patrol, Only Angels Have Wings, Air Force), several of the best screwball comedies (Twentieth Century, Bringing Up Baby, His Girl Friday), an immortal war story (Sergeant York), two sizzling Bogart-Bacall melodramas (To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep), a dazzling musical (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes), and several towering Westerns (Red River, Rio Bravo, El Dorado). </p><p>He was Hollywood's leading star-maker, having discovered or given important roles to Lauren Bacall, Montgomery Clift, Carole Lombard, Rita Hayworth, Frances Farmer, Jane Russell, Paul Muni, Joan Collins, James Caan, and Angie Dickinson. He was the most modern of the great masters and one of the first directors to produce his own movies and declare his independence from the major studios. His work has exerted a powerful influence on such contemporary directors as Martin Scorcese, Brian DePalma, Robert Benton, John Carpenter, Walter Hill, and Quentin Tarantino. </p><p>Howard Hawks was the filmmaking partner of Howard Hughes; the drinking buddy and working colleague of William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway; cofounder of Hollywood's first elite motorcycle gang; an inveterate gambler constantly in trouble with gangsters; and a self-styled ladies' man whose second wife was to become the celebrated Slim Keith. This first biography of Hawks penetrates the persona he so carefully constructed for himself and reveals one of the most formidable, complex, and enigmatic figures of Hollywood's Golden Age. </p><p>"Spectacular.... McCarthy's thick, rich biography...chronicles in vivid detail how perhaps the last great popular artist in the movies worked."--Los Angeles Times Book Review </p><p>"A fluent biography of the great director, a frequently rotten guy but one whose artistic independence and standards of film morality never failed."--The New York Times Book Review </p><p>"Hawks's life, until now rather an enigma, has been put into focus and made one with his art in Todd McCarthy's wise and funny Howard Hawks."--The Wall Street Journal </p><p>"Excellent...a respectful, exhaustive, and appropriately smartass look at Hollywood's most versatile director."--Newsweek </p><p>"McCarthy does a good job of distilling not so much a style as an unflinching philosophy of life....

McCarthy does an excellent job of evoking the backgrounds to Hawks's life....

Todd McCarthy...quietly dismantles much of this picture.... In area after area Hawks, skilled at inflating his achievements, made himself his most carefully constructed artifact.... As McCarthy breaks through Hawks's protective shell of misrepresentations, this golden figure takes on a poignant quality--all that effort to be what he was not."--The Atlantic Monthly </p><p>"Todd McCarthy has been engaged in this, the first biography of Howard Hawks, a long time. Every Hawksian is in his debt: There is never going to be a fuller record of the external life and work of Howard Winchester Hawks.... We see and feel the director on set, rewriting as he goes, coaxing his actors to extend and improvise, building scenes and fun-and keeping it all in balance.... As a working portrait of a great director and contriver, this book is beyond compare. Time and again, the detail adds to our pleasure with the films."--L.A. Weekly Literary Supplement </p><p>"McCarthy...provides Hawks with the major biography he deserves, exhaustively re</p>A pleasingly thorough, if not critically groundbreaking, retrospective of the works and life of Hollywood's most versatile (and, to some cineasts, best) director. Hawks was born into a successful midwestern mercantile family. Detailing the level and range of their business successes, film critic McCarthy (King of the B's, 1975) suggests how the confidence bred in Hawks by his family's position strengthened his determination when he came to Hollywood: He wanted to work in a number of different genres, and he wanted to remain independent of the big studios. Despite the odds, he did. McCarthy focuses with great and admirable detail on Hawks's films. His life was rowdy and colorful (he was a womanizer and a gambler), and McCarthy communicates the essentials without ever losing focus on the director's artistry. Especially fascinating is the chapter on Red River, a blend of the requisite quotes on the previously untapped acting ability of John Wayne (e.g., Ford's ``I didn't know the sonofabitch could act!''), tales of sparring between Wayne and costar Montgomery Clift and Hawks's dissatisfaction with Joanne Dru, a concise analysis of the movie's importance to Hawks's artistic freedom, and not too much about the film's already much- discussed homoerotic intonations. Highlights from other chapters include fresh discussions of overlapping dialogue in the romantic comedies, recaps of the sometimes surprising public response to his films (too-cynical Twentieth Century was a box office dud), and end-of-chapter roundups of critical views of each film, notable for including not only reviews of the time but the opinions of film historians like Jeanine Basinger and little-known critics like Jean-Pierre Coursodon. Though the most enjoyable book on Hawks remains Joseph McBride's Hawks on Hawks, this is an essential complement to it and to studies by Wood, Wollen, and others. It portrays in wide-screen format a life until now presented only in sketches. (16 pages photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Brilliant takes the Bible seriously and every page contains an artifact from some ancient culture testifying to the reality of these true events of history.<br><br> Every two-page spread is a different topic filled with revelations showing that the biblical timeline is correct and the millions-of-years evolutionary time-frame could not possibly be true. For instance:&nbsp;<br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Soft, non-decayed dinosaur tissue has been documented inside of numerous dinosaur bones. This is absolutely impossible if these bones are millions of years old but perfectly fits the burial of dinosaurs 4350 years ago during Noah&#x2019;s flood. Yet professors showing this information to students have been fired. Other pages display ancient burial stones from Peru revealing drawings of dinosaurs and ancient medical technology &#x2013; both testifying to mankind&#x2019;s brilliance and recent creation.&nbsp;<br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The ice age was a direct consequence of the global flood. This is carefully explained and documented throughout the book. Following the flood, mankind was traveling the world looking for places to settle and seeking new sources of raw materials. One page documents an ancient map showing the coastline of Antarctica BEFORE it was covered by ice of the ice age. Modern textbooks place the start of the ice age starting 200,000 years ago - making this map impossibility. The Bible would place the ice age after the flood - meaning the existence of this map confirms biblical reality because people after the flood would have been exploring this area before it was covered with ice and documented what they found.&nbsp;<br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Carbon-14 levels would have radically shifted following the flood and the implications of this are explained so that readers clearly understand why this method of dating cultures gives erroneous dates and has mislead people as to the true age of ancient artifacts.&nbsp;<br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon man were simply races of people living in a harsh ice age environment immediately after the flood. They were actually highly intelligent human beings who developed chemical glue compounds which even modern researchers have struggled to reproduce and artwork few today could duplicate. There were obviously as intelligent and creative as modern man.&nbsp;<br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ancient Chinese artifacts document events from the Garden of Eden in both the written symbols of their language and ancient bronze sculptures.&nbsp;<br> ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pyramid structures build by ancient civilizations have been documented from around the world and had to have been produced simultaneously with the Egyptian pyramids. Even today it is debated how these ancient cultures could have developed such advanced technology so early in human history. Brilliant shows how this knowledge came from a source which predates the flood of Noah (i.e. knowledge from brilliant people living before the flood would have come through the flood with Noah and his family) and shows how multiple civilizations containing millions of people would have rapidly developed within 4-5 centuries of the flood.&nbsp;<br><br> In general, Christians are woefully ignorant of how to fit the ice age, ape-men, archeological discoveries, continental plate tectonics, and/or ancient Chinese/Egyptian/Peruvian/and other cultures into a real Biblical timeline. Brilliant shows how all these things not only logically fit a Biblical perspective but confirm its accuracy while contradicting the evolutionary perspective.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Bruce Malone has spent the last 25 years bringing the scientific evidence for creation to churches and colleges at seminars throughout the United States and eight foreign countries. &nbsp;He has also authored six books on the evidence for creation with over 200,000 copies in print; served as adjunct speaker for the Institute for Creation Research; is an associate speaker for Logos Research Associates Inc.; and is a commissioned worldview speaker under Chuck Colson&#x2019;s Centurion program - bringing a recent Biblical creation understanding to worldview issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Bruce has 27 years of research experience with the Dow Chemical Corporation but left in 2008 to act as full time Executive Director of Search for the Truth Ministries with the vision of &#x201c;Awakening Hearts and Minds to Biblical Truth&#x201d;. &nbsp;This organization widely distributes his Bible-affirming creation materials to students and prisoners. &nbsp;Bruce has a B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati and holds 17 patents for new products with Dow Chemical. &nbsp;Bruce and his wife Robin have been married for 30 years and have four grown children and three grandchildren &nbsp;They reside in Midland, Michigan.<br></p><h2>Green Wizardry: Conservation, Solar Power, Organic Gardening, And Other Hands-On Skills From the Appropriate Tech Toolkit</h2><p><p>Merlin, Gandalf, Voldemort&#x2014;these well-known sorcerers from popular culture are famed for their amazing spells and spectacular magical powers.

So she decides it's time for a change -- she styles her hair in the newest, daring mode, puts on a shockingly transparent gown, and goes to a ball like Cinderella, hoping to find a prince charming to sweep her off her feet...and into his bed.</p><p>But instead of a prince, she finds only her own volatile, infuriatingly handsome...husband, Rees, the Earl Godwin. They'd eloped to Gretna Green in a fiery passion, but passion can sometimes burn too hot to last.</p><p>But now, Rees makes her a brazen offer, and Helene decides to become his wife again...but not in name only. No, this time she decides to be very, very wicked indeed.</p></p><p><p>Eloisa James is a <em>USA Today</em> and <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and professor of English literature, who lives with her family in New York, but can sometimes be found in Paris or Italy. She is the mother of two and, in a particularly delicious irony for a romance writer, is married to a genuine Italian knight. Visit her at www.eloisajames.com.</p>Rounding out her quartet of Regency-era romances (<i>A Wild Pursuit,</i> etc.), James delivers the story of Helene, long estranged from her husband, Rees, who pens comic operas and thrives on scandal. The very proper Helene enjoys the solicitude of the rest of Societyï¿½&#x20ac;"until she decides that she wants a child and will have one even if she has to go outside her marriage. Shaken out of his self-involvement by Helene's determination, Rees offers a bargain: he'll father Helene's child, making it legitimate, if she agrees to move into his house for a month and help him with his opera. The catchï¿½&#x20ac;"his current mistress will remain in the house. Rees has a secret, however; he's keeping his mistress there only for her skilled voice, not out of love or even interest in the woman. Bit by bit, Helene and Rees come to terms with the disastrous first year of their marriage, including Rees's lack of skill in the marital bed (which is refreshing for a romance hero), and they begin to wonder if their love can be rekindled. James's zingers aren't as plentiful here as in past novels, but she still fires off a quiver full and solidifies her reputation as a top talent in the crowded field of humorous romances.<br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Through the grace of her stories we come to see how a lack of intimacy with the natural world has initiated a lack of intimacy with each other.<br><br> Williams shadows lions on the Serengeti and spots night herons in the Bronx. She pays homage to the rogue spirits of Edward Abbey and Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe, contemplates the unfathomable wildness of bears, and directs us to a politics of place. The result is an utterly persuasive book&#x2014;one that has the power to change the way we live upon the earth.</p><p>Terry Tempest Williams makes it clear that we lose an essential part of ourselves when we neglect the earth, but this collection of essays does not offer a soapbox delivery of tired manifestoes; rather, it uses poetic and insightful inspiration to urge the reader to become aware, assess the damage, and begin to heal broken bonds. In her essay "Yellowstone: The Erotics of Place," Williams writes, "There is no defense against an open heart and a supple body in dialogue with wildness. Internal strength is an absorption of the external landscape. We are informed by beauty, raw and sensual. Through an erotics of place our sensitivity becomes our sensibility."<p>A native of Utah, Williams is best known for her reflections on the American West, but the first essay in this book takes us to Africa's Serengeti Plain: "Morning comes quickly near the equator. There is little delineation of dawn. On the Serengeti, it is either day or night. A peculiar lull occurs just before sunrise. The world is cool and still. Gradually, the sun climbs the ladder of clouds until the sky mirrors the nacreous hues of abalone."</p><p>Through these readings you'll discover that Williams's "unspoken hunger" is for us to live lives with greater intent and accountability and in greater intimacy with the natural world. <i>--Kathryn True</i></p>ves her observations in the naturalist field and her personal experience--as a woman, a Westerner, and a Mormon--into a resonant manifesto on behalf of the landscapes she loves, making clear as well that, through our disregard of this world, we have lost an essential connection to our deepest selves.</p><h2>A Pocketful of Goobers: A Story about George Washington Carver (Creative Minds Biographies)</h2><p><p>There wasn't anything that George Washington Carver couldn't grow. He took the common goober--today's peanut--and created hundreds of useful products from it, turning goobers into a very profitable staple for the South. At the same time, this very special man passed on to everyone who knew him the importance of following one's own dreams.</p></p><p><p>Mitchell lives in Otonabee, and she taught English literature at Trent University in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>ea. vol: (Creative Minds Series). CIP. Carolrhoda. May 1986. PLB $8.95. Grade 3-6 Four biographies that are compact and well written. All of the books employ an upbeat style of writing combined with occasional humor. While each of the subjects came from environments which emphasized concerns other than those which eventually became their personal missions, children are shown the connection between early interests and preoccupations and later achievements. Matzeliger and Carver are depicted in situations indicative of the racial intolerance of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. Mitchell shows young readers the inequities of racial prejudice and portrays vividly the courage that these men displayed in the pursuit of their work. The biographies have a good sense of setting and contain much factual information. Dialogue does appear in all four stories, but it does not detract from credibility and is not used to excess. Of the four biographies, readers may find the one about Matzeliger, inventor of the shoe-lasting machine, to be the most enlightening, since far less has been written about him, and consequently, less is known of him than of the other three men. Black-and-white illustrations complement and enhance the texts. Karen P.

How do these books, from Genesis to Revelation, fit together?&nbsp;<i>The Story of Scripture</i>&nbsp;guides the reader through the four major themes of the Bible&#x2014;Creation, Fall, Redemption, New Creation&#x2014;showing how each individual book of the Bible tells a cohesive story centered on Jesus.</p><p>Matthew Y.

This work helps us see the striking beauty of the story of Scripture, and leads us to respond in worship of the Savior.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Matt Boswell</b>, hymn writer; founder, Doxology and Theology; and pastor of ministries and worship, Providence Church, Frisco, TX<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I believe it&#x2019;s a sign of spiritual health that so many evangelicals have become interested in biblical theology. You hold in your hand (or see on your screen!) the best brief introduction to the discipline. In&nbsp;<i>The Story of Scripture</i>, Matt Emerson expertly translates technical concepts for general readers and thoughtfully applies biblical theology to life and ministry.

He also adds brief,&nbsp;perceptive&nbsp;explanations of the underlying theological themes that construct the contours of the Bible. Emerson believes knowing&nbsp;how to apply biblical truth to our lives&nbsp;depends on recognizing the biblical story and where one is in&nbsp;the story.&nbsp;He&nbsp;persuasively illustrates this in his discussion on preaching, doctrine, biblical counseling, the Christian life, and the church&#x2019;s mission.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Keith S.

Edwards award,&nbsp;the James Madison Book Award, and a National Book Award nomination. Born and raised in New Jersey, Jim lives in Maplewood, NJ, with his family.&nbsp;<br> jimmurphybooks.com.Gr. 5 and up. As he did in <i>The Boys' War</i> (1990) and <i>The Long Road to Gettysburg</i> (1992), Murphy draws on memoirs and letters to humanize history. This time his main source is the journal of the great writer Robert Louis Stevenson, who traveled in 1879 from Scotland to the woman he loved in California, first on a crowded boat and then on a series of crammed, painfully uncomfortable trains on the transcontinental railroad. Murphy weaves together Stevenson's perilous journey with a general history of the railroad--how it was planned and built, who built it, what it was like to ride it if you were rich and if you were poor, and how it changed the country and those who lived there. Murphy's style is plain: facts and feelings tell a compelling story of adventure and failure, courage and cruelty, enrichment and oppression. The handsome book's design includes lots of white space, two endpaper maps, and many prints, drawings, and black-and-white photographs, carefully captioned to make you pore over the details. The direct quotations from Stevenson show him as observer and participant. This was before he became famous, and he identifies with the emigrants' painful struggle as well as their hope. He's excited by the diversity in America (he loves the place names that express how "all times, races, and languages have brought their contribution"); at the same time, he's appalled at the treatment of Native Americans ("I was ashamed for the thing we call civilization"). Murphy provides no direct documentation (often the source is "one passenger recalled," "some historians have speculated"), but the very long bibliography will be a starting point for those stimulated to read further. The experience of ordinary people revitalizes the myths of the West. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Becoming Leonardo: An Exploded View of the Life of Leonardo da Vinci</h2><p><b>"I found&nbsp;Mr. Lankford&#x2019;s&nbsp;writing thought-provoking and Mr. Isaacson&#x2019;s thought-stifling.<i> </i>Mr.Lankford proposes a great many insights...With immediacy and grace, <i>Becoming Leonardo </i>starts on a high note and gets better to the very end.</b>"&#x2014;<b><i>WALL STREET JOURNAL</i></b> <br><br><b><i>A&nbsp;</i>Wall Street Journal<i>&nbsp;2017 Book of the Year</i></b><br><b><i>A&nbsp;</i>Spectator<i>&nbsp;2017 Book of the Year</i></b><br><br>Why did Leonardo Da Vinci leave so many of his major works uncompleted?

The timbre of the voice, the thoughts visible in his eyes, the physical gestures when happy or sad, the way he walked, his smell, his hands, the habitual grimace his friends knew all too well but no one bothered to record&#x2014;all that is lost. When he was young there was no reason to write any of it down, and when he was old he became too hard to describe, too strange. What to do with Leonardo?</p><p>It&#x2019;s helpful in terms of myth building to have fewer facts rather than more. Were Leonardo born today we&#x2019;d have hospital records, blood types of both parents, genealogies going back to Charlemagne, not to mention the views of his neighbors there in the tiny tourist town of Vinci. Fortunately, for the sake of romance and myth, we have none of that but for a single scrawled entry in a family ledger by his grandfather Antonio: &#x201c;1452. There was born to me a grandson, the son of Ser Piero my son, on the 15th day of April, a Saturday, at the 3rd hour of the night. He bears the name Lionardo.&#x201d;</p><p>Swaddled and lying there in the straw-stuffed cradle, a couple of early spring flies buzzing his face (one perhaps landing on his lip and beating its wings) that little red baby started life with one large problem: He was, by the rules and customs of the day, illegitimate. Outside the law. His parents were not married. They apparently were not even properly introduced. Traditionally it was thought his mother was a local girl who let the neighboring notary&#x2014;Ser Piero&#x2014;get too close in a dark place. New evidence suggests that Leonardo&#x2019;s mother Caterina may have been a house slave brought to Italy from elsewhere. Which means, it might have been rape.</p><p>Because of the plague and such massive death, Florence&#x2014;the city-state that ruled Vinci, the tiny village beside Mount Albano where Leonardo was born and which gave him his name&#x2014;had permitted the importation of slaves, provided they were infidels and converted immediately to Christianity and took Christian names, most often young women from Turkey and North Africa. Caterina was a popular name and it so happened that a wealthy client of Ser Piero&#x2019;s named Vanni di Niccolo owned a slave named Caterina. Niccolo died in 1451 and as executor of his estate Ser Piero would&#x2019;ve had to deal with his property, including Caterina. The next year a Caterina appeared in Vinci, pregnant by Ser Piero. Nothing is known of her past.</p><p>Which would mean little or nothing but for the evidence of Leonardo&#x2019;s fingerprints on a few of his paintings, fingerprints that reveal the same dermatoglyphic structure&#x2014;that is, the same pattern of loops and whorls&#x2014;as people of Middle Eastern origin.</p><p>If true, it could mean Leonardo grew up not just a bastard son living with a weak claim on family, but of mixed race as well. Not obviously so, as it was not remarked on by Vasari or anyone else, but it would&#x2019;ve been part of his own identity and well-known while growing up in the village. It meant he was two things, not one. And perhaps later this was even a part of his &#x201c;mysteriousness,&#x201d; something ill-defined about him, something he hid.</p><p>And if so, then it suggests two more possibilities. One, that if Caterina had a hand in raising him or saw him frequently, and told him stories, both to entertain him and make him proud, then what kind of stories might those be? Fantastic? Heroic? Self-justifying? Stories from her home country? Or perhaps stories she made up? An important question. What kind of cross-cultural tall tales was the little kid hearing? There was at the time a cult of the Magi which had wisdom coming from the east.</p><p>And two, notice that as an adult his sense of fashion seemed rather more Turkish than Italian: the long hair and beard curled, the purple cloak, the rings and such. He rather resembled an Ottoman Pasha out for a stroll. This was a deliberate adult identity that may well have started as youthful fantasy and wishful thinking. Caterina may be the key to understanding Leonardo&#x2019;s unique identity in later years, but in truth we have nothing but a few fingerprints and a couple of indirect references to guide us. Much later, in 1503 when he was fifty-one, he made an effort to move to Constantinople, writing to the Sultan Bayezid II and offering his services, all while praising Allah.</p><br>&#x2014;<p>THE ADULT IS formed in childhood, and Leonardo&#x2019;s childhood is a factual blank. What were his shaping forces? It&#x2019;s generally thought that he was raised by his grandparents and uncle Francesco in Vinci, assisted perhaps by Caterina just down the road in Campo Zeppi, while his father built his notary business in Florence, roughly thirty miles away and on the other side of Monte Albano.</p><p>Leonardo as an adult certainly seemed a willful person (to say the least) who expected to get his own way, so how might an eighty-year-old grandfather have influenced that? Likewise, an uncle only sixteen years older than Leonardo himself? The suggestion is of a clever boy doted on by his grandparents and uncle while his less-engaged father is away.</p><p>One also imagines a childhood free to roam the countryside and eat bugs and drink from the streams. No doubt five-year-olds perished quickly in those days, and no doubt a curious boy would get into trouble rather more often than not. But the rocks Leonardo fell off of and the streams that nearly drown him and the mule that threw him twenty feet into the weeds&#x2014;none of those hypothetical events seemed to have harmed him much, or left visible scars.</p><p>But how could we know? Scarring was common in the age before antiseptics. So common that it would not be remarked on unless it was a defining feature of some kind, or prompted a nickname perhaps. Back then the whole of humanity was covered with scrapes and scars. It was evidence of being alive. Yet Leonardo was described by Vasari and others as attractive and well-coiffed, so the inevitable accidents of childhood left no mark that can be seen from this distance.</p><p>The village of Vinci is located on a high hill, above the valley but still beneath Monte Albano. It is pock-marked with hundreds of gullies and low places where, lying down, a boy can see nothing but the sky above. Visually it&#x2019;s a place of contrasts, but what dominates the surrounding area is not even visible from Vinci, and that&#x2019;s the city of Florence on the other side of Monte Albano. It cannot be over-stressed what the presence of a city nearby means to a child growing up isolated in the country&#x2014;especially an important city where amazing things were to be seen and marveled at. It was a place he heard about each time his father returned, and from every passing visitor, and perhaps a place he&#x2019;d visited as a boy, but he was fifteen or so before he moved there and growing up in the vicinity of such a place magnetized his life. It had to. He had the long view, and in the distance, on the other side of the mountain that blocked him, was something glorious. And because he couldn&#x2019;t see it, mysterious as well. Such things shape the mind and dreams.</p><p>Other than his grandfather and mother Caterina, the other large but unaccounted influence in Leonardo&#x2019;s young life was his uncle Francesco. Uncles can be a good thing. When all else fails, sometimes it&#x2019;s the uncle who steps in to save the day. Biographer Serge Bramly describes Francesco as a &#x201c;gentle and contemplative man of independent character, who surely knew the names and qualities of plants (the region is rich in medicinal herbs), the signs of bad weather, the habits of the wild creatures, and the superstitious legends that govern country people&#x2019;s acts.&#x201d; Leonardo would&#x2019;ve acquired in Francesco&#x2019;s company a love for the outdoors and a curiosity about the natural world. It seems they were always close, even as Leonardo grew older. When Francesco died childless in 1506, it was to Leonardo, and not to his legitimate nephews, that he left his possessions.</p><p>The likelihood is that Francesco visited Florence on occasion, and likely took little Leonardo along with him once the boy was old enough to travel. To prime the pump of Leonardo&#x2019;s imagination there had to be examples for him to mull over, experiences to re-inhabit and embellish, and the village of Vinci offered little in the way of cathedrals or libraries or aesthetic thrills beyond those of nature.</p><p>Other than Caterina, I think his uncle was the major influence in his young life. What I could never prove but strongly suspect is that Leonardo learned from the personal example of his uncle Francesco to <i>take your time and get it right</i>. This craftsman&#x2019;s code is so embedded in Leonardo, so idiomatic of his personality, I think it had to have been learned early and repeated often. There was a &#x201c;go slow&#x201d; movement at the time that reflected a very real need of some to live quietly, rejecting the quick pace of the marketplace. Think of Montaigne a hundred years later, or Epicurus seventeen hundred years before. Unlike his brother, Francesco lived in the country, forswearing the city. Why? Might the pace of the country be more congenial to him, and might this in turn have influenced Leonardo in the same quiet and contemplative way?</p><p>Leonardo grew in response to what he knew and heard from others. To aspire you first have to see, to take aim, and Leonardo had an imagination that clearly turned toward art. So what did he see that turned him? Francesco likely took Leonardo along with him on business trips to Florence where they stayed with Ser Piero and saw the sights. Thirty miles isn&#x2019;t that far. No doubt he&#x2019;d seen the occasional icon or statue in a local church near Vinci or Empoli, but that&#x2019;s clumsy devotional art and not likely to set the mind on fire. My guess is Leonardo was already throwing off sparks, and it was his uncle Francesco who saw it first and fanned it into flame.</p><p>One item of his childhood rarely remarked on is that the village of Vinci is on top of a rather high hill, meaning little Leonardo would&#x2019;ve grown up with a line-of-sight of twenty-two miles or more to the distant horizon. Perhaps only an urban flatlander can appreciate this, but most people&#x2019;s field of vision growing up can be measured in tens of feet, up to a half mile perhaps. An ordinary horizon on flat ground out in the open is three miles. Leonardo grew up with a bird&#x2019;s-eye view of the countryside that was panoramic, a view that surely worked its way into his dreams as childhood landscapes often do. How different would he have been if the family had lived in Venice instead of Vinci?</p><p>Hilltops also have considerably more wind, which suggests the flying of kites and the gathering of birds. A flatland Leonardo, like a watery one, would not have been quite the same boy. He was a child of the hill country who grew up with a little thinner air and a longer view than most. This shaped him&#x2014;especially once he got into the thick atmosphere and narrow streets of Florence.</p><p>How did children grow up in the fifteenth century? Mostly, I&#x2019;d say, thanks to a certain amount of luck. Hilltops attract lightning strikes. Storms are worse. Likewise, a stranger passing through and sneezing could result in you breaking out in pustules. The average lifespan was a bit under forty, but you had to survive childhood first. Leonardo knew people who died young. Everyone did.</p><p>Death was everywhere. In 1456, a hurricane ravaged Tuscany. Leonardo was four years old and heard it from inside the house&#x2014;assuming the roof stayed on. Periodically, as a result of drought, there were severe famines where cannibalism was not unheard of. Between the ages of ten and fifteen there were also outbreaks of plague in his area. And plague appeared again when he was twenty-seven and living in Florence, and again at age thirty-two for three long years in Milan, when nearly a third of the city&#x2019;s population died. For Leonardo, epidemics were a fact of life. Death, everywhere, always. Even the murder rate in Europe then was more than thirty times what it is today. One key to understanding Leonardo is to see the brutal chaos he came out of, the chaos he tried to separate himself from, the noise on every side. It was not an easy place to think a straight thought.</p><p>People could die of a small cut or broken bone, and people he knew surely did during his fifteen years growing up in Vinci. Animals were slaughtered and he watched this closely, as any country kid would. Chickens plucked, necks rung, heads boiled and skinned&#x2014;any child with imagination and empathy would twitch ten times a day just being out of the house. Either that or turn into a tough guy who was impervious to the pain of others. We see evidence of both later on. Both together: the exterior remove, the interior churn. From his drawings and sensibility we know he loved animals and knew them well. He would later write fables where the animals spoke and gave humans wise advice. He also had a fable where a rock did the same. A talking rock. These were his friends growing up. He talked to them and they talked back. He became a vegetarian after all, and collected interesting rocks all his life. Maybe for companionship.</p><p>How much pain and misery did he witness in his early years, and what effect did it have? I would imagine any Renaissance imagination must have been framed by death, and spurred on by it. <i>Memento mori</i>. He learned to distrust life early on, I suspect, probably one day at a time. The family dog, the favorite cat, his grandfather, his father, here today and gone tomorrow, catch what you can.</p><p>Francesco&#x2019;s advice: <i>Slow down, breathe deeply, Leonardo. Take your time and think it through</i>.</p><p>Without a doubt his drawing was a source of solace, of tuning out the world, and of capturing it as well. Consider those early lost drawings not for their focus on some particular thing, like a twig or a frog, as would be usual, but for what&#x2019;s blocked out. They are psychological documents as well as artistic. Any drawing is. Most importantly, one senses that the act of drawing became his way to learn about a thing. It was how he contemplated the world.</p><p>One of Leonardo&#x2019;s greatest discoveries as a chil...</p></p><h2>Dead Certainties: Unwarranted Speculations</h2><p>Like his The Embarrassment of Riches and the bestselling Citizens, Simon Schama&#39;s latest book is both history and literature of immense stylishness and ambition. But Dead Certainties goes beyond these more conventional histories to address the deeper enigmas that confront a student of the past. In order to do so, Schama reconstructs -- and at times reinvents -- two ambiguous deaths: the first, that of General James Wolfe at the battle of Quebec in 1759; the second, in 1849, that of George Parkman, an eccentric Boston brahmin whose murder by an impecunious Harvard professor in 1849 was a grisly reproach to the moral sanctity of his society. Out of these stories -- with all of their bizarre coincidences and contradictions -- Schama creates a dazzling and supremely vital work of historical imagination.</p><p>"An infinitely beguiling book...a mind-teasing delight...Schama brings to bear an immense array of narrative elements."<p>-- The New York Times Book Review</p><p>"Intriguing and provocative... Dead Certainties inspires us throughout to examine our own assumptions about history and fiction"-- Newsday</p><p>"A virtuoso performance... in Schama's hands the past loses its remoteness and takes on the noise and clutter of experience....He has become one of the few contemporary historians who are read as much for themselves as for their subjects."</p><p>-- Andrew Delbanco, New Republic</p>Simon Schama is the prize-winning author of seven acclaimed books.

In this sparkling collection of essays, he brings this vast experience and a keen critical eye to bear on craft issues facing literary writers. Examples from masters such as Leo Tolstoy, Flannery O'Connor, and Alice Munro illustrate this engaging discussion of what makes great writing.</p><br><p>At the same time, Boswell moves readers beyond the classroom, candidly sharing the experiences that have shaped his own writing life. A chance encounter in a hotel bar leads to a fascinating glimpse into his imaginative process. And through the story of a boyhood adventure, Boswell details how important it is for writers to give themselves over to what he calls the "half-known world" of fiction, where surprise and meaning converge.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert Boswell</b> is the author of five novels, most recently <i>Century's Son</i>. He teaches creative writing at New Mexico State University, the University of Houston, and in the Warren Wilson MFA Program.</p>In clear, charming prose, novelist Boswell delivers a satisfying exploration of the craft of writing fiction, drawing from an array of well-chosen examples. In one instance he offers a full-bodied analysis of Tolstoy's <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i> to illustrate his argument about the use of social paradigm in fiction; in a chapter on politics in the novel, he helpfully streamlines a Noam Chomsky essay into an explanatory list of the political responsibilities of the intellectual. Boswell's defense of his concept of the half-known world&#x2014;the idea that there must be a dimension to the fictional reality that escapes comprehension&#x2014;is spiritedly articulated and defended, and the book feels written for the serious writing student rather than the beginner. However, while addressing a sophisticated audience, he is direct&#x2014;a chapter on omniscient narrators answers tough narrative questions in an easy-to-follow manner. Throughout, Boswell presents autobiographical moments and brief vignettes of his own devising to illustrate his concepts, reinforcing the fact that, like his great predecessor in craft writing John Gardner, he is a working fiction writer who knows his material. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Then two stars came along: Greta Garbo, who turned the femme fatale into a woman whose capacity for love and sacrifice made all other human emotions seem pale; and Norma Shearer, who succeeded in taking the ingenue to a place she'd never been: the bedroom. In their wake came a deluge of other complicated women-Marlene Dietrich, Jean Harlow, and Mae West, to name a few. Then, in July 1934, the draconian Production Code became the law in Hollywood and these modern women of the screen were banished, not to be seen again until the code was repealed three decades later. </p><p>A thorough survey and a tribute to these films, <i>Complicated Women</i> reveals how this was the true Golden Age of women's films.</p></p><p><p><b>Mick LaSalle</b> is the film critic for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> and teaches a class at University of California at Berkeley on pre-Code film. He lives in San Francisco.</p><p>&#x201c;LaSalle's marvelous Complicated Women is the best kind of film book, making us see with fresh eyes the women of pre-Code Hollywood, a truly revolutionary lot by any standards. LaSalle wittily and insightfully celebrates the multiform 'New Woman' of the late '20s and early '30s. The author does a persuasive job of reminding us of the contribution of lesser-known stars while rescuing the much-maligned Norma Shearer from her gilded cage as MGM's plastic princess and restoring her to her rightful place as a breathtakingly risky (and risquï¿½) sensualist with plenty of career savvy. Bravo!&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Molly Haskell, author of From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies</i></p><p>&#x201c;Mick LaSalle's Complicated Women isn't just a great title for life, it's an eye-opening examination of pre-Code Hollywood that retrieves lost films and overlooked careers. It's also a delight to read and argue with.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Thompson, author of Beneath Mulholland and Rosebud</i></p><p>&#x201c;Mick LaSalle is a guy who really knows his stuff. He's actually seen everything he writes about, evoking a whole era of forgotten movies in a refreshing style that's not just a series of rehashed plots, but a witty, insightful joyride without an ounce of pomposity or patronizing, while at the same time providing the unsuspecting viewer with a fun guide on how to 'read' pre-Code movies.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bruce Goldstein, Director of Repertory Programming, Film Forum, New York</i></p><p>&#x201c;Mick LaSalle's Complicated Women is a revelation: He takes us back, with wit, passion, and intelligence, to those brief shining years of the early 1930s when Hollywood women movie stars like Norma Shearer could be erotic, funny, and independent--with no hell to pay.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kate Buford, author of Burt Lancaster: An American Life</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sophisticated and provocative.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;An overdue examination of a historic conflict between Hollywood and would-be monitors of morality.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;In prose as snappy and sassy as the movies he describes, LaSalle restores to their rightful stature smart, sexy actresses like Ann Dvorak . . . and especially Norma Shearer.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Elle</i></p></p><h2>Teaching Truly: A Curriculum to Indigenize Mainstream Education (Critical Praxis and Curriculum Guides)</h2><p>For the first time in educational publishing, <em>Teaching Truly</em> offers K&#x2013;16 teachers course-specific guidelines for indigenizing mainstream education. The goal is to facilitate greater educational integrity and relevance in the classroom now, without waiting for more ï¿½reformsï¿½ to policy, standards or curricula in general. Incorporating reality-based teaching common in traditional Indigenous learning cultures, each chapter first exposes educational hegemony, including that existing within the new ï¿½common core standardsï¿½, and then offers alternative, time-tested perspectives and exercises to counter and/or counter-balance such hegemony. Addressing eight common subject areas, the material can be adapted for different grade levels and can be applied to other mainstream courses.</p><p>Four Arrows (Don Trent Jacobs) has a PhD in Health Psychology from Columbia Pacific University and an EdD in Curriculum and Instruction with a Cognate in Indigenous Worldviews from Boise State University.

We must nurture and preserve our common possession, the traditional commons, for future generations, and this must be one of our highest values, or we are all doomed. To regain this sensibility from those who have preserved it we must pay careful attention to their understanding and practices, especially their educational practices as brought to us in these thoughtful chapters.ï¿½ (Noam Chomsky, Professor Emeritus at MIT, author of more than 120 books, recipient of the 2011 Sydney Peace Prize and one of the top ten most-cited individuals in the world, living or dead)<br> <br> ï¿½Teaching Truly subtly raises the issue of the difference between education for the purpose of raising human consciousness and education for the purpose of creating workers for the global economy. Four Arrows makes it clear that our focus on the material and away from the spiritual aspect of our nature has created not only an imbalance in our mind/body/spirit that manifests in disease, dispirited communities and alienated children but also in the outward imbalance and disharmony on the planet that gives us life. In order to move forward, sometimes we need to connect with the best of our past. This book and its curriculum ideas are an opportunity and a gift to our children and the future. It is time to remember, to honor and to teach the great wisdom of our indigenous ancestors &#x2013; this may be our last hope.ï¿½ (Nancy Turner Banks, M.D., author of <i>AIDS, Opium, Diamonds and Empire</i>)<br> <br> ï¿½Teaching Truly is a singularly provocative book with the unsettling analysis that education is not about learning and economics is not about the well-being of society. As today&#x2019;s institutions crumble in their dysfunction, Four Arrows draws upon tens of thousands of years of empirical data within Indigenous societies, crucial intelligence on what works and how to unleash the kind of learning that will help us become human beings present and in balance with Mother Earth.ï¿½ (Rebecca Adamson, president of First Nations Development Institute, founder of First Peoples Worldwide and inductee to The National Woman&#x2019;s History Hall of Fame)<br> <br> ï¿½This is a necessary book, a part of the revolution we so desperately need.ï¿½ (Derrick Jensen, author of <i>A Language Older than Words</i>)<br> <br> ï¿½At a time when mainstream education is viewed as impoverished and lacking in meaning, this engaging book invites educators to start a self-reflective dialogue on educational innovation stimulated and inspired by the indigenous wisdom.

There's nothing terribly wrong with previous translations; but none captures the wit and candor of Apuleius until now. This term, I used the new translation by Joel Relihan in a Carleton course and the results were beyond my very lofty expectations: students, for the first time, had something close to direct access to Apuleius' prose and they responded with an enthusiasm I've never encountered before. Relihan has given Apuleius a voice in English as never before, and my students and I laughed out loud, often, in reading passages aloud, and we felt the power of Apuleius' wit and open vulgarity.

It's a tough read, but definitely a worthwhile one, and the author's personality and strength shine through on every page. Covering the years from 1975 to 1979, the story moves from the deaths of multiple family members to the forced separation of the survivors, leading ultimately to the reuniting of much of the family, followed by marriages and immigrations. The brutality seems unending--beatings, starvation, attempted rape, mental cruelty--and yet the narrator (a young girl) never stops fighting for escape and survival. Sad and courageous, her life and the lives of her young siblings provide quite a powerful example of how war can so deeply affect children--especially a war in which they are trained to be an integral part of the armed forces. For anyone interested in Cambodia's recent history, this book shares a valuable personal view of events. <i>--Jill Lightner</i><p>One of seven children of a high-ranking government official, Loung Ung lived a privileged life in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh until the age of five. Then, in April 1975, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge army stormed into the city, forcing Ung's family to flee and, eventually, to disperse. Loung was trained as a child soldier in a work camp for orphans, her siblings were sent to labor camps, and those who survived the horrors would not be reunited until the Khmer Rouge was destroyed.</p><p>Harrowing yet hopeful, Loung's powerful story is an unforgettable account of a family shaken and shattered, yet miraculously sustained by courage and love in the face of unspeakable brutality.</p></p><h2>Who Rules The World</h2><p>Who Rules the World</p><p>Noam Chomsky is the bestselling author of over 100 influential political books, including Hegemony or Survival, Imperial Ambitions, Failed States, Interventions, What We Say Goes, Hopes and Prospects, Making the Future, On Anarchism, Masters of Mankind and Who Rules the World.

Bloom, once described by Gore Vidal as, &#34; ... the most beautiful of postwar screen presences and the finest interpreter of Ibsen in this generation,&#34; writes that she was entranced by Roth during their first meeting in 1966. A decade later they moved in together, and she was his muse during the late 70s and early 80s. But Roth&#39;s abusive temper and bouts with depression made life nearly intolerable. Even so, they married in 1990, only to divorce a short time later. Though Bloom recounts Roth&#39;s violence and betrayal in frightening detail, she never explains why she couldn&#39;t muster the strength to simply leave him.In 1982, English actress Claire Bloom (b. 1931) published a memoir, Limelight and After, that focused on her professional achievements. This second memoir reveals her personal life. "Now," she writes, "all the factors have altered, and I am free to tell my story in full." Bloom invests the first half of her narrative with a plainspoken eloquence as she recounts her difficult childhood in London, Florida and New York, and as she writes of her affairs with a series of dashing but unreliable men?including Richard Burton and Yul Brynner?with regret but genuine affection. The heart of the book, though, and no doubt its main selling point, is Bloom's long and bitterly angry account of her 18-year relationship?including a marriage?with Philip Roth, who is portrayed here as a brilliant monster, inventively cruel and manipulative. His seductiveness, writes Bloom, "wasn't charm; it was intelligence." By the end of their relationship, Bloom sees him as a "game-playing, Machiavellian strategist." Roth may nor may not have had it coming, but Bloom's hundred-page aria of ire makes for uncomfortable reading in any case. It seems a genuine cri de coeur, howver, voiced with the sensitivity that distinguishes the rest of this earnest soulful autobiography. Photos not seen by PW.

John Archibald Wheeler's fascinating life brings us face to face with the central characters and discoveries of modern physics. He was the first American to learn of the discovery of nuclear fission, later coined the term "black hole," led a renaissance in gravitation physics, and helped to build Princeton University into a mecca for physicists. From nuclear physics, to quantum theory, to relativity and gravitation, Wheeler's work has set the trajectory of research for half a century. His career has brought him into contact with the most brilliant minds of his field; Fermi, Bethe, Rabi, Teller, Oppenheimer, and Wigner are among those he called colleagues and friends. In this rich autobiography, Wheeler reveals in fascinating detail the excitement of each discovery, the character of each colleague, and the underlying passion for knowledge that drives him still. Photographs</p><p>What are little physicists made of? <i>Geons, Black Holes &amp; Quantum Foam</i>, in John Wheeler's science autobiography. To the rest of us, getting excited over the properties of atomic nuclei and the forces that hold invisible particles together may seem eccentric, to say the least. But physicists hold the secrets of the universe in their heads, and they have a special place in human history. Einstein, Bohr, Fermi, Oppenheimer--their names are inextricably linked with the mysteries of the atom. Wheeler, among the most creative physicists of our time, tackled questions related to the nature of space, time, and gravity alongside his more well known colleagues. Renowned as a teacher, Wheeler worked with student Richard Feynman to imagine a subatomic world where particles move backward in time. With fellow physicist and former student Ken Ford, Wheeler has crafted an engaging look at the eye of the 20th-century physics hurricane. There's a lot of physics in this book, which may put off those shy of its terminology and abstractions, but the stories and photographs of the men and women who know the atom will help readers see the humanity in science, and the warmth and passion of its practitioners. This is a remarkable history of one man's part in revealing the underlying nature of everything. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>A mixture of Wheeler&#39;s life and Wheeler&#39;s physics. This book is half John Wheeler&#39;s life and half his physics. If you are interested in the people, you can skim through the physics. If you are interested in the physics, you can skim through the people. (If you are interested in both, so much the better.) The book provides a good way to have a look at many of the principal physicists of the twentieth century, including Wheeler himself, and a good way to learn a lot of mind-stretching modern physics, even if you have no background in the subject. -- Kenneth W.

A new century, new threats to love...Love without risks is like war without deaths - but, today, love is threatened by an alliance of liberalism and hedonism. Caught between consumerism and casual sexual encounters devoid of passion, love - without the key ingredient of chance - is in danger of withering on the vine. In &#34;In Praise of Love&#34;, Alain Badiou takes on contemporary &#39;dating agency&#39; conceptions of love that come complete with zero-risk insurance - like US zero-casualty bombs. He develops a new take on love that sees it as an adventure, and an opportunity for re-invention, in a constant exploration of otherness and difference that leads the individual out of an obsession with identity and self.

So runs the well-known passage in the Bhagavad Gita (translation by Prabhavananda and Isherwood), giving words to an eternal hope in the human heart. </p><p>In this book the reappearance of the Christ is recognised as inevitable within the continuity of divine revelation. Not only has God never left Himself without witness, but at definite periods in the history of human evolution, the "word of God", the projected potency of His vital life, has manifested in form in order to establish the principles to be demonstrated during the coming cycle. </p><p> There have been many such messengers over the ages, manifesting through one or another of the great world religions or followed by a new form of religion based on the new revelation. Divine revelation and the periodic appearance of messengers, or Avatars, occur, however, according to cosmic law, when certain conditions exist within the whole scheme affected by, and affecting, every part, large and small. Then a chain of events is set in motion which under law must eventually work out. </p><p> The part that our little planet Earth plays in this intricate and smoothly functioning system of inter-relationships seems to be of vital importance at this time. The esoteric and planetary significances of the reappearance of the Christ are suggested in this book as underlying causes for His Aquarian service to humanity. </p><p> This is the beginning and end of an age--the beginning of Aquarius and the end of Pisces--marking also a major turning point in the evolution of human consciousness from individual need to the needs of humanity as a whole, from personal salvation to world service, and from materiality to spirituality. It seems that this climaxing transition must be "marked" in both its stages, beginning and end, by the Christ Himself, and a principle anchored in human consciousness, which embodies not only the love or God established for the age of Pisces, but also the new potency for the future, the "Will" of God, into which only the Christ is as vet fully and perfectly absorbed. </p><p> The imminence of the reappearance of the Christ is sensed and expected by many, belonging as He does to all humanity irrespective of differing religious dogma and doctrine. "He for whom all men wait" will Himself determine the manner and the timing of His appearance and the area of his work in a way which creates no divisions or separations between men, either religious, social or ideological. Not only does He come as the first Son of God, but as Head of the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. He is, therefore, a great world executive, representing the Kingdom of God, and fulfilling a definite function in the world of men. He is coming to establish through precept and example in world service the principles on which a united, interdependent and interactive world may create its new material systems and spiritual institutions for the new civilisation. </p><p> Preparation for the second coming is the responsibility of humanity; it is for those who know and accept the imminent return of the Christ to prepare men's minds and hearts to recognise and receive Him, and to create those conditions of balance and spiritual alignment which will ultimately draw Him forth into our midst. For no matter what message or revelation the Christ may embody when He comes, no matter what principle or energy He may anchor on Earth for human use, He is not coming to save humanity from the results of its own sins, but once more to show humanity how to save itself in the new conditions and new opportunities with which the world is faced. </p></p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master, and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime.An extract from the Tibetan teacher, written in 1934 briefly explains the intent of these teachings: The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance. They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertain their truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither I nor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspired writing, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being the work of one of the masters. If they present truth in such a way that it follows sequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if the information given raises the aspiration and the will to serve from the plane of the emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found) then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth a response from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings a flashing forth of the intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But not otherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemed true under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good. But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said. --Lucis Publishing Company</p><h2>Great Myths of the World (Dover Books on Anthropology and Folklore)</h2><p>Great Myths of the World A collection of tales from ancient myth and legend.

Here is a speaker intent on discovery: &#x201c;Oh whole world, we choose / another.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This award-winning collection simmers with wit as Brodak confronts tragedy, childhood losses, transcendent love, and the question of art itself.

Except&#x2014; / scared, scared&#x201d;&#x2014;that rises above personal sorrow, her fierce and painterly poems redefine nature and art and what exists between: &#x201c;Lately, there is spangled shade in my space / and a cold apple orchard to tend in place of consciousness.&#x201d; As Reginald Shepherd said about the poems in Brodak&#x2019;s first collection, the chapbook&nbsp;<i>Instructions for a Painting</i>, her world is &#x201c;&#x2018;small enough / to sing in all directions,&#x2019; and large enough to take us there.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Michigan-born Molly Brodak currently lives in Augusta, Georgia, where she is a lecturer in English and humanities at Augusta State University.

It&#x2019;s a journey of no easy answers, where &#x2018;the future had scalloped edges,&#x2019; and is not something waiting, but something happening.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Gallaher,<i> Laurel Review</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In Molly Brodak&#x2019;s poems, peril happens&#x2014;a real thing&#x2014;and then a flashbulb goes off or night comes on, and <i>after</i> begins again.

He writes them to Emma, a woman he sees at a party.

Emma&#x2019;s replies are not revealed, but the narrator&#x2019;s persona is as he philosophizes and courts the object of his affection. He is a fan of boxing, a scientist by trade, and a student of the vortex&#x201d; an entity he uses to describe his self-deterioration and the emptiness in his life. Together, the letters reveal the internal dialog of a conflicted protagonist who shadowboxes Emma, himself, and even the reader.</p></p><p>An unnamed man studies the Vortex and his surroundings.

You can&#x2019;t divorce a book.</i></p><p>Gloria&#x2019;s right. You can&#x2019;t divorce a memoir. But, as the twenty successful authors in this book attest, you can (and some do) divorce, disown, de-friend, or defame a memoirist. If you want to ruin your life and/or others&#x2019;, there&#x2019;s really no more surefire method than writing a true-life tale according to you.</p><p>Why, then, do so many authors risk public, private, and/or professional excoriation for the dubious pleasure of writing about themselves? What is it about sharing one&#x2019;s deepest thoughts, feelings, and experiences with others that makes it worth the mayhem and mishegas?</p><p>Without demand, of course, there would be no supply. So we must also ask why we <i>read</i> memoirs. For centuries, readers, reviewers, and social commentators have been gobbling up first-person narratives, all the while diagnosing the books&#x2019; authors with attention-seeking disorders. Is the urge to read memoirs the same urge that makes us peek into strangers&#x2019; undraped windows at night&#x2014;not <i>just</i> because we&#x2019;re nosy, but to learn something from how other people live, in order to live better lives ourselves?</p><p>Whatever the reasons for our attachment to memoir, it&#x2019;s a phenomenon that&#x2019;s unlikely to go away anytime soon. The genre has been around since St. Augustine wrote his thirteen-volume <i>Confessions </i>around A.D. 400. In one form or another, memoir lives on today&#x2014;in the journal entry, blog, confessional e-mail, or Facebook post you wrote an hour ago. Forgive us, Descartes; today&#x2019;s philosophy of existence might best be expressed thusly: &#x201c;I overshare, therefore I am.&#x201d;</p><p>People who love memoirs claim that the telling of the true-life story is the contemporary incantation of oral history, an invaluable contribution to the enlightenment, the collective consciousness, perhaps even the evolution of the species.</p><p>People who don&#x2019;t love memoirs say the genre is a scourge upon the human race, a playing field upon which attention-craving, sensationalistic, crass, and craven narcissists head-butt and navel-gaze their way to the bestseller lists.</p><p>Between the covers of this book, twenty very different memoirists share their very different reasons for doing what they do and their sometimes different, sometimes overlapping approaches to the controversies that surround the genre.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m always asking myself if material I have from my own life would be best used in a novel or a memoir or a short story or an essay,&#x201d; says Cheryl Strayed. &#x201c;I was moved to write <i>Wild</i> as a memoir because I thought that was the best way to tell that particular story.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I actually never intended to publish a book,&#x201d; says Ishmael Beah, whose bestselling <i>A Long Way Gone</i> describes his life as a twelve-year-old soldier in Sierra Leone. &#x201c;Writing [became] for me a way to prove my existence.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Some of us are the designated rememberers,&#x201d; <i>The Death of Santini </i>author Pat Conroy told me. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why memoir interests us&#x2014;because we&#x2019;re the ones who pass the stories.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have never written memoir by choice,&#x201d; says Edwidge Danticat, author of <i>Brother, I&#x2019;m Dying</i>. &#x201c;Each time I write memoir, in short or long form, something happens that compels me to do it&#x2014;something that feels pressing and urgent, something that there is no other way to express.&#x201d;</p><p>How does memoir writing differ from journal keeping? Should a memoir be a work of art, produced for the benefit of the reader&#x2014;or a cathartic writing experience for the benefit of the author?</p><p>&#x201c;People want to believe that a memoirist has simply opened a vein and bled on the page,&#x201d; according to Ayelet Waldman. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a diary. A diary can be emotionally satisfying, it can be great therapy, but it&#x2019;s not necessarily good writing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A memoir is not simply stringing together the five or ten good stories you&#x2019;ve been telling about your wacky childhood for your whole life,&#x201d; Nick Flynn says.</p><p>But A. M. Homes says she wrote a memoir about her adoption &#x201c;to organize the information and the experience&#x2014;to put it in a container, if only to set the container aside for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>When I asked the writers about the morality of memoir&#x2014;whether memoirists are obligated to protect the privacy of the loved (and not-loved) ones in their lives&#x2014;emotions ran high.</p><p>Sue Monk Kidd said that writing memoir is &#x201c;a dance between being true to my need to write authentically and my responsibility to those around me not to cross over into their private hearts and extract something that doesn&#x2019;t belong to me.&#x201d;</p><p>Edmund White said, &#x201c;Memoir should be extremely honest and personal. It should show the author for who he is, warts and all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A memoirist&#x2019;s contract with the reader is that you&#x2019;re telling the truth and nothing but the truth. That requires telling everything there is to say about everyone involved.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What I worried about most, writing the memoir,&#x201d; said Kate Christensen, &#x201c;was offending people or causing anyone pain. I&#x2019;m used to writing about invented characters. Writing about real people was a huge stretch&#x2014;a leap into new territory.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At first I was worried that my book would be really exploitive,&#x201d; Anne Lamott said. &#x201c;But then my editor said, &#x2018;It won&#x2019;t be exploitive if you don&#x2019;t exploit anyone.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Whatever your thoughts and feelings about this provocative, evocative genre, whether you&#x2019;re a producer or a consumer of memoir, or neither, or both, I hope you&#x2019;ll benefit from the literary, emotional, psychological, and moral self-examination that&#x2019;s on display in these pages.</p><p>In their own books, the memoirists included here bare all. In <i>this</i> book, they bare all about baring all, excavating the personal and professional agonies and ecstasies, moral conundrums, and psychological battles that come with the job.</p><p>&#x2014;Meredith Maran</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Ishmael Beah</p><p><i>There were all kinds of stories told about the war that made it sound as if it was happening in a faraway and different land. It wasn&#x2019;t until refugees started passing through our town that we began to see that it was actually taking place in our country.</i></p><p><i>&#x2014;</i>Opening, <i>A Long Way Gone</i>, 2007</p><p>In 1993, when Ishmael Beah was twelve years old, antigovernment soldiers invaded his village of Mogbwemo, Sierra Leone. Along with many other boys, he fled the village, spent months wandering the countryside, and was then conscripted into the government army at age thirteen. In 1996, after witnessing and committing unthinkable acts of war, Ishmael was rescued by UNICEF, which helped him with his rehabilitation and reinsertion into normal life. He was later adopted by an American woman, Laura Simms, and found a home and a school&#x2014;the United Nations International School&#x2014;in New York City.</p><p>From there Ishmael made his way to Oberlin College, where he studied political science and took some creative writing courses with the novelist Dan Chaon. By the time he graduated in 2004, Ishmael had a draft of the memoir that would become <i>A Long Way Gone</i>, his account of his years as a child soldier.</p><p>The book was an immediate hit; it has since sold more than 1.5 million copies. But its publication was not without controversy. In early 2009, Rupert Murdoch&#x2019;s <i>Australian </i>investigated Ishmael&#x2019;s story and said that his account was exaggerated. The paper claimed that the attack on Ishmael&#x2019;s village had happened in 1995, not 1993 as described in <i>A</i> <i>Long Way Gone. </i>Since Ishmael had been rescued by UNICEF in 1996, the <i>Australian</i> claimed, he&#x2019;d been a child soldier for months, not years.</p><p>Three days after the article appeared, Ishmael published a rebuttal, saying, &#x201c;I am right about my story. This is not something one gets wrong&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

I consider myself a writer who happened to be introduced as a writer to the world through a memoir, a nonfictional book. I actually never intended to publish a book.</p><p>Prior to making the commitment to write my memoir, writing had become for me a way to prove my existence. Apart from my passport, I had no physical objects or documentation to do so.</p><p>I remember when I began applying to schools in the United States. I was asked to provide a report card. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have one,&#x201d; I would say. Often the response was &#x201c;Well, everyone has a report card.&#x201d; I would chuckle and correct them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m from Sierra Leone, and I don&#x2019;t have one.&#x201d;</p><p>When I started high school in New York, I wrote an essay titled &#x201c;Why I Do Not Have a Report Card.&#x201d; I got a glimpse then that my core reason for writing would be to expose people to certain realities and hope to deepen their understanding of the other, of places that may seem far away.</p><p>A sense of urgency made me do it</p><p>The story of <i>A Long Way Gone</i> was the first story I needed to tell with urgency. There were other stories within me, but this one possessed me.</p><p>Writing it also came out of several frustrations. I felt the need to correct the way my people and my country were portrayed. Each time I said to someone that I was from Sierra Leone, they responded by telling me about the horrors of the civil war, as though it had always been that way and as if war was the only identity of my country. There was no context, and more important, no human context, in the way my people were presented. Here I was, a young man living away from home, carrying a splinter of the very story that was misrepresented. So I had to do something about it, using my small part of a much larger story.</p><p>Writing as if each book might be my last</p><p>Whether I am writing nonfiction or fiction, I always write about things that are meaningful to me&#x2014;situations that speak to my being. I approach each piece of writing, whether it&#x2019;s a short story, a book, or a novel, as though it were the first and last story I will write.</p><p>There was risk involved</p><p>I worried that people wouldn&#x2019;t want to read my memoir because their initial response to the subject matter was only a reaction to the violence, the kind they hear or read about, without the human context and framework. That framework has the power to make a person understand that there is nowhere in the world where people will choose violence if they have other viable ways of living.</p><p>My aspiration was to show how everyone is capable of violence if you happen to find yourself in circumstances that propel you toward violence as a way to live. I wanted to show that no one can decide ahead of time whether you will embrace violence or not until you are in a certain situation.</p><p>I very much wanted to show the realities of war. At the same time, I was overwhelmed by the need to be careful not to write something that could be mistaken as an endorsement or a celebration of violence.</p><p>I was fueled by the importance of putting the human face on war, the worst kind of war, and showing the strength of human beings to outlive life&#x2019;s worst circumstances. I wanted to show that beauty and hope can exist even when there is no reason for hope, even when it seems all has been lost.</p><p>Protecting the innocent</p><p>For those people in my memoir who were alive and I could find, I explained to them what I was embarking on and that I would present them from my point of view. Those who weren&#x2019;t comfortable, I used only their first names.</p><p>As to my own privacy, I just wrote from how I thought about things as a child, in sort of a matter-of-fact way and unapologetically. I had to return to how I felt about things as a child, as a boy, not as the young man I had become by the time I wrote the book.</p><p>I knew, though, from the beginning, that I wouldn&#x2019;t share everything. It isn&#x2019;t possible to write about everything, and some things I needed to keep for my family and myself&#x2014;the deepest intimacies of my emotions and experiences. My desire was to take moments of my life to make a point, and that is what I did.</p><p>I feel satisfied that I s...</p></p><h2>Kildar (Paladin of Shadows Book 2)</h2><p>Problems, problems, problems! All Mike Harmon ever wanted to be was a SEAL. But after problems in the teams, college student was a decent second best. However, trouble seemed to follow him where he went. Now, after having angered every terrorist on Earth and at least five governments, buying a farm in a third world country was looking pretty good. Of course, nothing was ever simple. With Chechen terrorists knocking on the door and tenant farmers with a truly Byzantine culture, the question was whether he could drag the keldara into the 21st century before the Chechen put them back in the 6th. Kildar answers the question: Where would an international security specialist and former SEAL choose to retire&#x2014;if he's going to buy the farm, it should be one with beautiful women and the best beer in the world.

This left him with a wonderful appreciation of the oneness of humanity and a permanent aversion to foreign food. A veteran of the 82nd Airborne, he brings first-hand knowledge of military operations to his fiction. His novels for Baen include the four novels in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Posleen War series (<i>A Hymn Before Battle</i>, <i>Gust Front</i>, <i>When the Devil Dances</i>, and <i>Hell&#x2019;s Faire</i>), the Council War series (<i>There Will be Dragons</i>, <i>Emerald Sea</i>, <i>Against the Tide</i> and <i>East of the Sun and West of the Moon</i>), the novel <i>Into the Looking Glass</i>, four collaborations with <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author David Weber (<i>March Upcountry</i>,<i> March to the Sea</i>, <i>March to the Stars</i> and <i>We Few</i>) and two collaborative spinoffs from the Posleen series: <i>Hero</i> (with Michael Z. Williamson) and the <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>Cally&#x2019;s War</i> (with Julie Cochrane).Mike Harmon, the former Navy SEAL who stumbled on a jihadist plot to destroy America's morale in a particularly nasty manner in <i>Ghost</i> (2005), makes a welcome return in this entertaining sequel, which again is more techno-thriller than SF. When Harmon gets lost in a blizzard in Georgia (the country, not the state), he's saved by a young girl who takes him to a remote valley, which he purchases. Harmon develops a semifeudal relationship with the local mountain tribe, the Keldara, which he organizes into a militia for defense against Chechen raiders. He comes to learn much of their customs and history, but there are still secrets the Keldara keep even from the kildar, the tribe's ruler. In his role as warlord, Harmon is increasingly tempted to yield to the same dark side that plagued him in <i>Ghost</i>. As in his military SF, Ringo explores the moral complexities the warrior faces, giving fair warning that the road to hell is easy. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tree Spirit Tarot recounts the mythical and historical stories of 78 featured trees and their impact on our personal and collective understanding. By seeing how we are interrelated with trees, we can begin to reconnect to ourselves and each other. By bringing these shared stories to consciousness we awaken the tree of life within. This awakening is symbolic of our return to wholeness. Trees are reflections of our selves and our world. They are cross-cultural and archetypal symbols of the human condition. The Tarot was an illustrated deck of 78 cards that originated in 15th century Italy, its original name was &#34;trionfi&#34; meaning &#34;triumphs,&#34; symbolizing the paths one takes through life. The tarot is divided into two groups: The Major Arcana, and the Minor Arcana. The journey of the Wonderer (Fool/Hero) is also reflected in the teachings of Kabbalah, known as the Tree of Life. The Kabbalah shows the path of the soul as it descends through the Tree of Life to become human and then transcends to spiritual oneness. Tree spirits by their very nature are wise, nurturing and without judgment. Their goal is to support us on our journey and to provide guidance whenever we need it. Their guidance is one of insight based on their unique history and botany.

Analyzing a range of sources, including sexology texts, early cinema, and African American literature, Siobhan B. Somerville argues that the emerging understanding of homosexuality depended on the context of the black/white &#x201c;color line,&#x201d; the dominant system of racial distinction during this period. This book thus critiques and revises tendencies to treat race and sexuality as unrelated categories of analysis, showing instead that race has historically been central to the cultural production of homosexuality.<br> At about the same time that the 1896 Supreme Court <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> decision hardened the racialized boundary between black and white, prominent trials were drawing the public&#x2019;s attention to emerging categories of sexual identity. Somerville argues that these concurrent developments were not merely parallel but in fact inextricably interrelated and that the discourses of racial and sexual &#x201c;deviance&#x201d; were used to reinforce each other&#x2019;s terms. She provides original readings of such texts as Havelock Ellis&#x2019;s late nineteenth-century work on &#x201c;sexual inversion,&#x201d; the 1914 film <i>A Florida Enchantment</i>, the novels of Pauline E. Hopkins, James Weldon Johnson&#x2019;s <i>Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man</i>, and Jean Toomer&#x2019;s fiction and autobiographical writings, including <i>Cane</i>. Through her analyses of these texts and her archival research, Somerville contributes to the growing body of scholarship that focuses on discovering the intersections of gender, race, and sexuality.<br> <i>Queering the Color Line</i> will have broad appeal across disciplines including African American studies, gay and lesbian studies, literary criticism, cultural studies, cinema studies, and gender studies.<br></p><p>&#34;&#34;Queering the Color Line &#34;is a groundbreaking study that sets a new agenda for critical investigations of the intersecting histories of race and sexuality in the United States. Siobhan Somerville provides a model of interdisciplinary, politically engaged scholarship that is certain to become required reading in queer studies, race theory, and U.S. history as well as American literature.&#34;--Lisa Duggan, New York University<p>Siobhan B.

The primary question to which Professor Chatman addresses himself is what narrative is in itself. Following such French structuralists as Roland Barthes, Tzvetan Todorov, and Gerard Genette, he posits a what and a way. "The what of narrative," he says, "I call its 'story'; the way, I call its 'discourse.'" Liberally illustrating his concepts with discussions of particular novels and films, he effects a synthesis of the latest Continental critical thinking about narrative and the Anglo-American tradition exemplified by Henry James, Percy Lubbock, Wayne Booth, and others. A judicious and well-informed book, <i>Story and Discourse</i> should become a standard guide to narrative and to modern thinking about narrative.</p></p><p>Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film. &#39;For the specialist in the study of narrative structure, this is a solid and very perceptive exploration of the issues salient to the telling of a story-whatever the medium. Chatman, whose approach here is at once dualist and structuralist, divides his subject into the &#39;what&#39; of the narrative (Story) and the &#39;way&#39;(Discourse)... Chatman&#39;s command of his material is impressive.&#39;<p>Seymour Chatman is Professor of Rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley.</p></p><h2>EEG: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong><em>Financial Times</em> Book of the Year</strong></p><p><strong>An urgent new novel about death, war, and memory from the highly acclaimed Croatian writer</strong></p><p>In this breathtaking final work, Da&#x161;a Drndic reaches new heights.

Yet, Phillip Jennings sets the record straight in <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to the Vietnam War</i>. In this latest P.I.G.&#x201d;, Jennings shatters culturally-accepted myths and busts politically incorrect lies that liberal pundits and leftist professors have been telling you for years. The Vietnam War was the most important and successful campaign to defeat Communism. Without the sacrifices made and the courage displayed by our military, the world might be a different place. <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to the Vietnam War</i> reveals the truth about the battles, players, and policies of one of the most controversial wars in U.S. history.</p><p>Think the United States lost the Vietnam War? Think again.<p>No war in American history is so shrouded in obfuscation and myth as the Vietnam War: Vietnam&#x201d; has entered into our national memory as a byword for disaster, usually accompanied by the word quagmire,&#x201d; and the specter of the war has haunted our foreign policy discussions ever since. Left-leaning historians with a political agenda, aided and abetted by the liberal media, have convinced the world that for America, the Vietnam War was a tragic and dismal failure. Liberal pundits and leftist professors have been telling lies and getting away with it despite the fact that the war was televised at the time and has been the subject of innumerable books and studies.</p><p>But now, in <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide</i>&#x2122; <i>to the Vietnam War</i>, Phillip Jennings finally sets the record straight. Jennings, who fought in Vietnam as a Marine pilot and later as a pilot for the CIA&#x2019;s Air America, shatters the near universally accepted myths and politically correct lies that have obscured the truth about what happened in Vietnam for decades.</p><p>Jennings, who has made a lifetime&#x2019;s study of the war, gives you the surprising truth, and backs it up with facts that the liberal pundits ignore. He demonstrates that the United States did not lose the Vietnam War in fact, we won it. Far from failing dismally, the United States achieved its goal in Vietnam: we stopped the spread of Communism. Jennings explains how the cultural chaos of the 1960s and 1970s negatively influenced the Vietnam War not vice versa. Without the sacrifices made and the courage displayed by our military in Vietnam, the world would be a very different place today. <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide</i>&#x2122; <i>to the Vietnam War</i> reveals:</p><p>* Who won the war? The United States military lost more than 58,000 men in Vietnam; the North Vietnamese military lost more than <i>1.1 million</i> and Communism isn&#x2019;t exactly rolling up the map of Asia any more<br>* How John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s firm stand against Communist aggression&#x201d; took the form of an unclear, waffling policy that led to a series of blunders by liberalism&#x2019;s best and brightest&#x201d; foreign policy and defense advisers<br>* How Richard Nixon effectively won the war, while rapidly withdrawing U.S. troops only to watch a liberal Congress throw America&#x2019;s victory away<br>* How liberal Democrats continue to try, outrageously, to present their scuttling of South Vietnam as moral and political wisdom</p><p><i>The Politically Incorrect Guide</i>&#x2122; <i>to the Vietnam War</i> at last reveals the truth about the battles, players, and policies of one of the most controversial wars in U.S. history.<br></p>Praise for <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide</i> <i>to The Vietnam War</i><p> Phil Jennings has something to say, namely that the historical record, as selectively compiled and presented by the political Left, has done a terrible disservice to the hundreds of thousands of men who fought in The Vietnam War. With great passion, an unapologetic love of his country, and drum roll, please the truth to support his case Captain Jennings walks us through this tragic struggle, the war America never lost, but wasn t allowed to win, either. <br> L. Brent Bozell III, nationally syndicated columnist and president of the Media Research Center</p><p> When I first met Jennings at Camp Lejeune in the 1960s, he told me his ambition was to become the world s first successful right-wing folk singer. He failed miserably at that, but yet, over the last 40 years, he has managed to channel his energies toward successfully defeating political correctness wherever he finds it. This book debunks so many of what our generation s warriors know to be The Myths of Vietnam that it needs to be required reading. Lance Corporal Diogenes, you may extinguish your lamp. Our generation has found an honest man. <br> Major General Larry S. Taylor USMCR (retired), former Commanding General, 4th Marine Aircraft Wing</p><p> In the past several decades, no historical subject has been so grievously distorted by the politically correct as the Vietnam War. Whereas most of the war s chroniclers objected to American involvement at the time, Phillip Jennings was in Vietnam fighting the war, and like most veterans he disputes the antiwar narrative that has dominated the publishing world. His account skillfully weaves together a wealth of historical facts that blow apart the myths handed down by professors and journalists. <br> Mark Moyar, Ph.D., author of <i>Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954-1965</i><br>"</p></p><h2>Wringer (Newberry Honor Book)</h2><p><p><strong>Newbery Honor Book * ALA Notable Children's Book </strong></p><p><strong>"Deeply felt.

Nine-year-old Palmer dreads his upcoming 10th birthday. In his town, when boys are 10 years old they become "wringers," the boys who wring the necks of wounded pigeons at the annual Pigeon Day shoot. Palmer is sickened by the whole event. To make matters worse, his new buddies--Beans, Mutto, and Henry--have just discovered that Palmer has been hiding a pet pigeon in his room. What will Palmer do? Will he become a wringer to save face, or will he follow his heart? <i>Wringer</i> will appeal to preteens and younger teens who love to read suspenseful books on their own, but it would also be a good story to read aloud to spark discussion about the perils and nuances of peer pressure.<p>He did not want to be a wringer.</p><p><strong>Palmer LaRue is rnning out of birthdays.

For as long as he can remember, he's dreaded the day he turns ten -- the day he'll take his place beside all the other ten-year-old boys in town, the day he'll be a wringer. But Palmer doesn't want to be a wringer. It's one of the first things he learned about himself and it's one of the biggest things he has to hide. In Palmer's town being a wringer is an honor, a tradition passed down from father to son. Palmer can't stop himself from being a wringer just like he can't stop himself from growing one year older, just like he can't stand up to a whole town -- right? Newbery Medal winner Jerry Spinelli's most powerful novel yet is a gripping tale of how one boy learns how not to be afraid. </p></p><h2>The Seas</h2><p><p><strong>"<em>The Seas&nbsp;t</em>ook me back to how I felt as a kid, when you&#x2019;re newly falling in love with literature, newly shocked by its capacity to cast a spell..." &#x2015;Maggie Nelson (from the Introduction)<br><br> A Most Anticipated Book of Summer at <em>BuzzFeed, NYLON</em>, and more.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Moored in a coastal fishing town so far north that the highways only run south, the unnamed narrator of&nbsp;<em>The Seas&nbsp;i</em>s a misfit.

It explores the theological and spiritual currents spreading from Byzantium to the Orthodox Churches of the Balkans and Rus&#39;, which helped to maintain the identity and unity of the &#34;Byzantine Commonwealth&#34; even as the empire itself crumbled. It also presents the little-known story of the native Eastern Churches of Egypt, Ethiopia, Syria, Armenia, and Georgia.

Since that literature provides a goodly phenomenology of the experience of anima, I shall look here more closely at the rather neglected phenomenology of the notion of anima. Experience and notion affect each other reciprocally. Not only do we derive our notions out of our experiences in accordance with the fantasy of empiricism, but also our notions condition the nature of our experiences.&#34; (James Hillman)</p><p>The pioneering imaginative psychology of James Hillman that soon will span five decades has entered cultural history, affecting lives and minds in a wide range of fields. For the creativity of his thinking, the originator of Archetypal Psychology and author of A Terrible Love of War; The Soul&#x2019;s Code; and The Force of Character has received many honors, including the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic. He has held distinguished lectureships at Yale, Princeton, Chicago, and Syracuse Universities, and his books have been translated into some twenty languages. The American public showed its appreciation of his approach to psychology by placing his book, The Soul&#x2019;s Code, at the top of the bestseller list of serious works of nonfiction. Of his many books, Spring Publications has published Anima, Loose Ends, Archetypal Psychology: A Brief Account, Pan and the Nightmare, Suicide and the Soul, Insearch, Oedipus Variations (with Karl Kerï¿½nyi), The Thought of the Heart and the Soul of the World, Inter Views, and Lectures on Jung&#x2019;s Typology (with Marie-Louise von Franz).

His far-reaching reforms of theological understanding and church practices radically modified both church and society in Europe and beyond.

This series is an essential supplement for first-time encounters with primary texts, a lucid refresher for scholars and clergy, and an enjoyable read for the theologically curious.</p></p><p><b>Steven D. Paulson</b> is Professor of Systematic Theology at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. He is an ordained pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.Narrator Simon Vance delivers a clear and distinct narration of this book on the teachings of Martin Luther. This is part of a series of books on the theology of preachers of past centuries, including Calvin, Wesley, and Augustine. While the book at times seems pretty deep, Vance's clear diction and reading style make it easier to digest. Luther's core beliefs center on law versus grace, or faith versus works. Luther was faithful to the scripture and unafraid to stand for what he believed in. This thought-provoking audiobook is great for anyone interested in exploring the teachings of Martin Luther and the period of the Reformation.

It states that securities prices in financial markets must equal fundamental values, either because all investors are rational or because arbitrage eliminates pricing anomalies. This book describes an alternative approach to the study of financial markets: behavioral finance. This approach starts with an observation that the assumptions of investor rationality and perfect arbitrage are overwhelmingly contradicted by both psychological and institutional evidence. In actual financial markets, less than fully rational investors trade against arbitrageurs whose resources are limited by risk aversion, short horizons, and agency problems. The book presents models of such markets. These models explain the available financial data more accurately than the efficient markets hypothesis, and generate new predictions about security prices. By summarizing and expanding the research in behavioral finance, the book builds a new theoretical and empirical foundation for the economic analysis of real-world markets.<br></p><p><br><strong>Andrei Shleifer</strong> is professor of Economics at Harvard University.<br><br>"An excellent academic discussion of [stock mispricing] and other behavioral influences in the stock market."--Jeff Madrick, <em>New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"The only advanced undergraduate or graduate text available on the subject."--Jeffrey Wurgler, <em>Yale School of Management</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Transhumanist Reader: Classical and Contemporary Essays on the Science, Technology, and Philosophy of the Human Future</h2><p><b>The first authoritative and comprehensive survey of the origins and current state of transhumanist thinking</b> <p>The rapid pace of emerging technologies is playing an increasingly important role in overcoming fundamental human limitations.

Many philosophers regard consciousness as an entirely physical phenomenon, yet it seems to elude scientific explanation. On the other hand, viewing consciousness as a nonphysical phenomenon brings up even larger issues. If consciousness is <em>not</em> physical, how can it be explained?<br> Concise, up-to-date, and engaging, <em>A Dialogue on Consciousness</em> explores these issues in depth. It features two main characters, Tollens and Ponens--unemployed graduate students who secretly live in a university library--who bring the debate alive. Tollens and Ponens examine the most significant theories and arguments in the field, quoting key passages from both classic and contemporary texts. Their discussion encompasses an expansive and diverse range of ideas, from those that originated in the Enlightenment up to today's most current perspectives. The dialogue concludes with a consideration of the pros and cons of modern physicalist views and nonphysicalist alternatives. An extensive annotated list of suggested readings directs readers to the most relevant and helpful primary sources.<br> An accessible and entertaining introduction to this complex issue, <em>A Dialogue on Consciousness</em> ideal for courses in philosophy of mind and consciousness.

In moving through that framework, Wahl explains what the movement analysis is, how it works, and how readers can use it in their lives. </p><p> &#x201c;On the most fundamental level, L/BMA seeks to help you address how movement is relevant in your life,&#x201d; Wahl says. &#x201c;The text is designed to develop your knowledge of the Laban/Bartenieff lens and cultivate it in meaningful ways in your life.&#x201d; </p><p> That knowledge is useful in a wide range of activities, passions, and pursuits&#x2014;developing a fuller range of movement and expression in your moving body, developing choreography, coaching and teaching movement, observing and describing how movement is meaningful, and more. </p><p> Wahl has been practicing and teaching the L/BMA framework to undergraduate and graduate students since 2006, when she became a certified integrated movement studies analyst. In her book, she </p><p> ï¿½ brings a contemporary voice to L/BMA in a way that evokes the senses and the felt movement experience; </p><p> ï¿½ grounds readers in the theory and provides numerous practical applications, showing readers how to apply L/BMA in all facets of life and in any career; </p><p> ï¿½ incorporates a rich diversity of experiences in the dance field and beyond from other certified Laban movement analysts who apply L/BMA in their careers and lives; and </p><p> ï¿½ provides tried-and-true tips for applying L/BMA in your life. </p><p> The text is organized into three parts. <b>Part I </b>offers an overview and historical look at Laban/Bartenieff movement analysis and details the organizing themes and guiding concepts of L/BMA. You&#x2019;ll also learn about the origin of the L/BMA concepts and how they have changed and grown over the years. <b>Part II</b> presents the five categories of the L/BMA framework: body, effort, shape, space, and phrasing. This section provides an understanding of the elements of movement and focuses on why each element is useful. <b>Part III</b> helps you take what you learned in parts I and II and use it in meaningful ways in your life. It includes chapters on integrating L/BMA into your life and on first-hand experiences from a diverse group of people who use L/BMA in the dance field and beyond. </p><p> &#x201c;The process of using this material to shed new light on what you already are interested in and to expand your perceptive and expressive skills is challenging and exciting,&#x201d; says Wahl. &#x201c;You can make changes in how you move in your life to be more effective, easeful, and whole. You can become more skilled in movement observation and description. You can teach and coach others in movement with greater clarity and possible inroads.&#x201d; </p><p> Throughout the text, Wahl offers suggestions for experiencing and cultivating L/BMA in your life. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve designed it to help you perceive human movement with greater nuance and specificity, to talk about movement with greater clarity and precision, to coach movement with a greater rangge of possibilities, and to evoke the movement experience with a greater range of options,&#x201d; she says. </p><p> &#x201c;Ultimately, I&#x2019;ve designed it to organize your perceptions of movement and shed new light on its role in your life.&#x201d; </p></p><p><p><b>Colleen Wahl </b>received her Certified Laban/Bartenieff Movement Analyst (CLMA) certification in 2006 through Integrated Movement Studies (IMS).

A survey of criticism discusses the wide range of responses provoked by the play&#39;s handling of its historical theme, and concludes by focusing on the element of burlesque in the attempted social revolution portrayed.</p><p>John Dover Wilson&#39;s New Shakespeare, published between 1921 and 1966, became the classic Cambridge edition of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and poems until the 1980s.

Throughout its long history, this casebook has relied on classic cases to capture the fundamental principles of contract law. This new edition preserves and builds upon the book&#x2019;s distinctive character, especially its use of canonical cases and its sensitivity to the history. The newly added cases show how the basic principles of contract law continue to evolve, even in such well-explored areas as promissory estoppel and restitution. As before, this edition eschews any distinctive take on the law of contracts and thus allows each teacher using the book a broad range of choice on what to bring in to channel or expand classroom discussion.<br><ul><li>The most visible alteration in this edition is a new focus on the bargaining environment in which contracts are formed and how legal rules shape it.</li><li>A significant amount of new material has been added, but the length of the book remains about the same.</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>The Alcoholic Family in Recovery: A Developmental Model</h2><p>Family relationships change dramatically when one or more members stops drinking. Far from offering a "quick fix" to family problems, in fact, the first years of sobriety are often marked by continuing tension that fuels marital stress, acting-out kids, and difficulties at work. This book explores the process of recovery from addiction as it affects the entire family, presenting an innovative model for understanding and treating families navigating this difficult period. The authors draw upon extensive clinical and research experience to demonstrate how families can be helped to regroup after abstinence, weather periods of emotional upheaval, and find their way to establishing a more stable, yet flexible, family system. <br></p><p>A major contribution....For years, there has been talk of the family disease&#39; without a comprehensive model for family treatment.

This searching and incisive analysis of the major world transformation now taking place shows how it will affect society,economics, business, and politics and explains how we are movingfrom a society based on capital, land, and labor to a society whoseprimary source is knowIedge and whose key structure is theorganization.</p><p><p>Peter F. Drucker is considered the most influential management thinker ever. The author of more than twenty-five books, his ideas have had an enormous impact on shaping the modern corporation. Drucker passed away in 2005. </p>Perceptive takes on the ``postcapitalist'' era, which, according to Drucker (Managing for the Future, 1992, etc.), got under way shortly after WW II. Every few centuries, the author notes, the West undergoes a convulsive transformation that, within 50 or so years, ushers in a whole new world. Identifying the Renaissance and Industrial Revolution as prior turning points, he asserts that the Global Village is in the midst of another watershed makeover that has already caused substantive changes in its economic, moral, political, and social landscapes. Drucker argues, for instance, that the same forces that put paid to Marxism as an ideology and Communism as a social system are making capitalism obsolete as well. In other words, knowledge (not labor, land, or other forms of capital) has become the planet's primary resource. The emergence of so-called ``knowledge workers'' able to put their specialized learning and/or competencies to use, he says, suggests that employees now own ``the means of production.'' Although the author concludes that markets will remain the effective integrators of economic activity, he believes that the implications of the ongoing shift will prove increasingly significant for the management of commercial enterprises and other key institutions. The same holds true for what Drucker designates ``the post-capitalist polity,'' in which transnational, regional, nation-state, even tribal structures compete and coexist. As concerned with prescription as description, the author doesn't shy away from calls to action that could make the unstable new world he envisions more productive and peaceable. He advocates, for example, the encouraging of environments that permit corporations to focus on their core responsibilities via partnerships or alliances, and the nurturing of autonomous nonprofit organizations that will restore the bonds of community as well as deliver grass-roots services.

Reprint.</p><p>John Ringo is author of the New York Times best-selling Legacy of Aldenata (Posleen War) series, which so far includes A Hymn Before Battle and nine sequels, the technothriller series starting with Ghost, a dark fantasy titled Princess of Wands, and many other novels for Baen. A veteran of the 82nd Airborne, Ringo brings first-hand knowledge of military operations to his fiction.Fans of Hollywood-style blood-and-guts sci-fi as exemplified in the film Independence Day will enjoy this sequel to A Hymn Before Battle (2000). Ringo's army background gives his series all the flavor and excitement of the liveliest military SF, illustrating both the tactical and strategic levels of a near-future war that started on distant worlds and has now come to Earth. In A Hymn Before Battle, resourceful Captain Michael O'Neal almost single-handedly defeated the vicious centaurlike Posleen in battle, but with Earth hanging in the balance in this book, it will take more than one man to turn the tide. Ringo begins with long and detailed human preparations for the expected invasion, introducing an immense cast of civilians, veterans, grunts and high-level officers. But when the Posleen forces arrive earlier than expected, improvised plans must be launched without delay. The humans fight for the most part with modern-day weaponry, assisted by advanced artillery from the Galactic Federation allies who got them into the fight in the first place. The resulting carnage will please those who relish high body counts. Ringo's characters often walk a fine line between heroic and stereotypical, while his extended expository passages slow the story. Still, this novel should cement Ringo's reputation as one of the best new practitioners of military SF. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Jewel Tree of Tibet: The Enlightenment Engine of Tibetan Buddhism</h2><p>Few teachers in the West possess both the spiritual training and the scholarship to lead us along the path to enlightenment. Robert Thurman is one such teacher. Now, in his first experiential course on the essentials of Tibetan Buddhism, adapted and expanded from a popular retreat he led, Thurman -- the first Westerner ordained by His Holiness the Dalai Lama himself -- shares the centuries-old wisdom of a highly valued method of insight used by the great Tibetan masters. <br> <br>Tibetans think of their cherished tradition of Buddhism as a "wish-fulfilling jewel tree" for its power to generate bliss and enlightenment within all who absorb its teachings. Happiness, in fact, is the true goal of Tibetan spirituality, and the wish-fulfilling jewel tree will enable you to reach that goal. Using a revered, once-secret text of a seventeenth-century Tibetan master, with thorough explanations for contemporary Westerners, <i>The Jewel Tree of Tibet</i> immerses you fully in the mysteries of Tibetan spiritual wisdom. A retreat in book form as well as a spiritual and philosophical teaching, <i>The Jewel Tree of Tibet</i> offers a practical system of understanding yourself and the world, of developing your learning and thought processes, and of gaining deep, transforming insight. <br> <br>One of the most explicit teachings of the steps on the path of enlightenment available, explained by a skilled Western teacher, <i>The Jewel Tree of Tibet</i> will enable you to honor the full subtlety and hidden depths of the Tibetan Buddhist path and realize at last its deeper rewards -- for yourself and others.</p><p>Robert Thurman is probably best know for his translation of the sacred text <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, although he has published many works of both translation and exploration of Tibetan Buddhism. <i>The Jewel Tree of Tibet</i> is a significant addition to Thurman&#x2019;s contribution to this field of spiritual scholarship. His deep knowledge and devotion are in evidence on every page. His style is straightforward and inviting. He also provides a short introduction to the history of Buddhism which is as clear and straightforward as possible for what can be an exceptionally complex and entangled topic. <p> In short, Thurman writes for real people with an interest in (perhaps longing for) a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world. In addition to a clear and inviting style and providing the reader with an accessible understanding of important spiritual matters, this book is exceptionally openhanded and openhearted. While Thurman wants us to share the dharma of the Jewel Tree he also wants the reader to know that they are already on their path- no matter what their faith or non-faith, political beliefs, no matter what manner of thinking may appear to divide, separate, or individualize us: Thurman presents a view of the self in which we can see that it is possible to overcome these limitations and alienations and to see ourselves as inhabiting common ground with the suffering, the joy, and the seeking of others. His bias is ecumenical in the best and most generous sense of the word. </p><p> This is an excellent book for the person just awakening to their spiritual path and for the seeker of many years.--<i>Julian Riepe</i></p>One of the leading Western scholars on Tibet and Tibetan religion, Thurman introduces listeners to the basic teachings of Tibetan Buddhism in the form of a six-part, guided retreat. An inspiring program for people of all religions.</p><h2>The Refashioning of Catholicism, 1450-1700: A Reassessment of the Counter Reformation</h2><p><p>Throughout its history, Christianity has adapted to contemporary society and culture in order to reach people effectively and have an impact on the world. This process often evokes controversy. Certainly this is the case in the current century, and so it was in the sixteenth. Robert Bireley argues that early modern Catholicism, the period known more traditionally as the Counter Reformation, was both shaped by and an active response to the profound changes of the sixteenth century&#x2015;the growth of the state; economic expansion and social dislocation; European colonialism across the seas; the Renaissance; and, of course, the Protestant Reformation.</p> <br><p></p><br><p>Bireley finds that there were two fundamental, contrasting desires that helped shape early modern Catholicism: the desire especially of a lay elite to lead a full Christian life in the world and the widespread desire for order and discipline after the upheavals of the long sixteenth century. He devotes particular attention to new methods of evangelization in the Old World and the New, education at the elementary, secondary, and university levels, the new active religious orders of women as well as men, and the effort to create a spirituality for the Christian living in the world.</p><p>This book will be of great value to all those studying the political, social, religious, and cultural history of the period.</p><br><p></p><br><p> ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</p><br><p><b>Robert Bireley, S.J.</b>, is professor of history at Loyola University Chicago.

Highly recommended."&#x2015;<i>Catholic Library World</i></p><p>"The learned Jesuit author of this concise textbook is well known for his studies, in English and German, on the relations of Catholic counsellors, especially members of the Society of Jesus, and statesmen of early modern Europe, and on Catholic statecraft at that time more generally. . . . Bireley argues for a period of Catholic renewal which, for all its special intensity, was not in any sense a mere reaction to or product of the Protestant challenge. There is stress here on institutional change, involving popes, bishops, and clergy, on new forms of spirituality, both in more traditional regular communities and in innovative groups pursuing a more active form of religious commitment, and on advances in Catholic education, for laity as well as clergy, females as well as males.""&#x2015;<i>Catholic Historical Review</i></p></p><p>ROBERT BIRELEY is Professor of History at Loyola University, Chicago.&#39;In summary, this book transcends linguistic and cultural boundaries to synthesise extremely well the best of recent writing on the history of modern Catholicism (the bibliography provides the proof of this).&#39; - Marc Venard, Revue d&#39;Histoire de l&#39;Eglise de France &#39;The emphasis throughout on the centrality of the lay piety is an excellent corrective to versions of confessionalization theory which remain too institutionally concerned with the state&#39;s direction of its subjects.

The Kitchen Book and The Cook Book have long been favorites of mine." - M.F.K. Fisher</p></p><p>Nicolas Freeling, best known for producing some of the finest of modern crime fiction, began his working life as an apprentice cook in a large French hotel. He continued cooking professionally for many years, and his enthusiasm for, and interest in, gastronomy in its broadest sense is at least equal to his passion for crime. Here, reprinted in a single volume, are his two splendid books of gastronomical memoir drawn from those experiences. Each is a delicious blend of the culinary and the literary, and include such recipes as cinnamon lamb stew and bouillabaisse, all charmingly floating about in a consistently entertaining text. The work is illustrated by the witty and winsome pen of John Lawrence, the perfect visual sauce for Freeling's savouries. Funny, wise, full of inspiration and delight, The Kitchen Book &amp; The Cook Book will find a place close to every cook's hearth and heart.Like many would-be authors, Nicolas Freeling spent his youth working in restaurants. He took to the profession while wandering Europe after finishing military service and dropping out of college. Discovering a talent and a taste for cooking, he managed to reach the position of senior chef at an Amsterdam hotel. However, as a foreigner in a prominent position, he attracted suspicion and was jailed for three weeks on dubious charges, during which time he started to write. He became famous for his crime novels, especially his Van der Valk series, which was adapted for television. His novels have both popular and critical appeal and received awards including an Edgar Award, a French Grand Prix, and a Gold Dagger Award. In later years, he wrote a series of cookbooks recalling his restaurant years. In keeping with his reputation as a master of suspense, Freeling&#39;s cookbooks are as engaging as any whodunnit mystery.</p><h2>The History of England</h2><p>One of the greatest figures of his age, Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-59) was widely admired throughout his life for his prose, poetry, political acumen and oratorical skills. Among the most successful and enthralling histories ever written, his <i>History of England</i> won instantaneous success following the publication of its first volumes in 1849, and was rapidly translated into most European languages. Beginning with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and concluding at the end of the reign of William III in 1702, it illuminates a time of deep struggle throughout Britain and Ireland in vivid and compelling prose. But while Macaulay offers a gripping narrative, and draws on a wide range of sources including historical accounts and creative literature, his enduring success also owes a great deal to his astonishing ability to grasp, and explain, the political reality that has always underpinned social change.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

In this uncut account of life on the edge, Davies delves into the turbulence of his own amazing life - from his inauspicious beginnings as a teenage dropout in the Muswell Hill suburb of North London to sudden and unbelievable stardom, plagued by an often volatile relationship with his older brother. Through Davies&#39; eyes, we see how the evolution of that relationship is reflected in their music. And Dave Davies holds nothing back in describing their lifelong feud, including the time Ray tried to trade Dave to a wealthy gay concert promoter in exchange for his mansion. From his 1960s hedonism, Dave Davies&#39; life as a rocker visited extreme lows and highs. In Kink, he looks at how he survived the cut-throat dealings of the record business, conquered alcohol and drugs, and overcame the tortures of paranoia and mental breakdown and his suicide attempts. And here, for the first time, Dave tells his remarkable story of personal spiritual awakening that profoundly changed his life.Dave Davies still tours with the Kinks all over the world and is involved in various film and music projects outside of the band. In 1990 he and the Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><h2>Pragmatism: A Reader</h2><p>Here are the major texts of American pragmatism, from William James, John Dewey, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Charles Sanders Peirce to Cornell West, Richard Rorty, Hilary Putnam, Richard Posner, and Richard Poirier, now collected and reprinted unabridged.

Walter Hodges (Everyman&#39;s Library Children&#39;s Classics Series)</h2><p><b>This indispensable classic, Rosemary Sutcliff's&nbsp;<i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i>--an adventure story that unfolds in Roman Britain, published in 1954--set the standard for all historical fiction for children that came after. EVERYMAN'S LIBRARY CHILDREN'S CLASSICS.</b><br><br>In the second century AD, the Ninth Legion marched into northern Britain to suppress a rebellion of the Caledonian tribes and was never heard from again. The young Roman officer Marcus Aquila sets off on a perilous journey to find out what happened to the legion in which his father served, and--if possible--to salvage its eagle and its honor. Accompanying him is Esca, his freed slave, with whom he gradually develops a deep and remarkable friendship that crosses the boundaries of conquest and colonialism. An unforgettable story of adventure, humanity, and the mysteries of the past.</p><p><b>ROSEMARY SUTCLIFF</b> was born in Surrey, England, in 1920, the daughter of a British naval officer. She was the author of four works of nonfiction, an autobiography, four novels for adults, and more than fifty books for children, including the eight volumes of the&nbsp;<i>Eagle of the Ninth</i>&nbsp;series. Sutcliff won many literary awards, including the Carnegie Medal for&nbsp;<i>The Lantern Bearers</i>, and received an OBE and a CBE for her services to children's literature.

FRONTIER FORT<br><br>From the Fosseway westward to Isca Dumnoniorum the road was simply a British trackway, broadened and roughly metalled, strehgthened by corduroys of logs in the softest places, but otherwise unchanged from its old estate, as it wound among the hills, thrusting farther and farther into the wilderness.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a busy road and saw many travellers: traders with bronze weapons and raw yellow amber in their ponies' packs; country folk driving shaggy cattle or lean pigs from village to village; sometimes a band of tawny-haired tribesmen from farther west; strolling harpers and quack-oculists, too, or a light-stepping hunter with huge wolf-hounds at his heel; and from time to time a commissariat wagon going up and down to supply the Roman frontier post.<br> &nbsp;<br> The road saw them all, and the cohorts of the Eagles for whom all other travellers must make way.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was a cohort of leather-clad auxiliaries on the road today, swinging along at the steady Legion's pace that had brought them down from Isca Silurium at twenty miles a day; the new garrison coming to relieve the old one at Isca Dumnoniorum. On they went, following the road that now ran out on a causeway between sodden marsh and empty sky, now plunged into deep boar-hunted forest, or lifted over bleak uplands where nothing grew save furze and thorn-scrub. On with never a halt nor a change of rhythm, marching century by century, the sun bright on the Standard at their head, and the rolling dust-cloud kicked up, over the packtrain behind.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the head of the column marched the, Pilus Prior Centurion, the cohort Commander, the pride that shone from him showing clearly that this was his first command. They were, he had long since decided, a command worthy of anyone's pride; six hundred yellow-haired giants recruited from the tribes of Upper Gaul, with the natural fighting power of mountain cats, drilled and hammered. into what he firmly believed to be the finest auxiliary cohort ever to serve with the Second Legion. They were a newly joined cohort; many of the men had not yet proved themselves in action, and the spear-shaft of their Standard had no honours on it, no gilded laurel wreath nor victor's crown. The honours were all to win- perhaps during his command.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Commander was a complete contrast to his men: Roman to his arrogant finger-tips, wiry and dark as they were raw-boned and fair. The olive-skinned face under the curve of his crested helmet had not a soft line in it anywhere- a harsh face it would have been, but that it was winged with laughter lines, and between his level black brows showed a small raised scar that marked him for one who had passed the Raven Degree of Mithras.<br> &nbsp;<br> Centurion Marcus Flavius Aquila had seen little of the Eagles until a year ago. His first ten years had been lived quietly with his mother on the family farm near Clusium, while his father soldiered in Judaea, in Egypt, and here in Britain. They had been going to join his father in Britain, but before the time came for them to do so, rebellion had flared up among the northern tribes, and the Ninth Hispana, his father's Legion, had marched north to deal with it, and never came marching back.<br> &nbsp;<br> His mother had died soon afterwards, leaving him to be brought up in Rome by a rather foolish aunt and the plump and purse-proud official who was her husband. Marcus had loathed the official, and the official had loathed Marcus. They saw everything with different eyes. Marcus came of a line of soldiers- one of those Equestrian families who, when the rest of their kind had turned from soldiering to trade and finance, had kept to the old way of life, and remained poor but held their noses high in consequence.<br> &nbsp;<br> The official came of a line of officials, and his code of life was quite other than Marcus's. Neither of them had a shred of understanding for each other's ideas, and they had both been thankful when Marcus was eighteen and could apply for a centurion&#x2019;s commission.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marcus, his eyes narrowed into the sun as he marched, smiled to himself a little wryly, as he remembered how almost pathetically thankful that plump official had been. (Tramp, tramp, tramp, said the cohort's feet behind him.)<br> &nbsp;<br> He had asked to be sent to Britain, though it meant starting in an auxiliary cohort instead of a line-of-battle one, partly because his father's elder brother had settled there when his own years of soldiering were done, but mostly because of his father. If ever anything became known of the lost Legion, it would be known first in Britain, and it might even be that here in Britain he would find out something for himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marching down the Isca Dumnoniorum road in the run-honey evening light, he found himself thinking about his father. He had very vivid memories of a slight, dark man with laughter lines at the corners of his eyes, who had come home from time to time, and taught him to fish, to play 'Flash the Fingers', and throw a javelin. He remembered vividly that last leave of all. His father had just been appointed to command the First Cohort of the Hispana, which ï¿½meant having charge of the Eagle and being something very like second-in-command of the Legion beside; and he had been like a jubilant boy about it. But his mother had been faintly anxious, almost as if she knew ...<br> &nbsp;<br> 'If it was any <i>other </i>Legion!' she had said. 'You have told me yourself that the Hispana has a bad name.'<br> &nbsp;<br> And his father had replied: 'But I would not have it any other Legion if I could. I held my first command in the Hispana, and a man's first Legion is apt to hold chief place in his heart everafter, be its name good or bad; and now that I go back to it as Firs~ Cohort, we will see whether there is nothing can be done to better its name.' He had turned to his small son, laughing. 'Presently it will be your turn. It has fallen on evil days, but we will make a Legion of the Hispana yet, you and I.'<br> &nbsp;<br> Looking back across the years, Marcus remembered that his father's eyes had been very bright, like the eyes of a man going into action; and the light had caught suddenly in the great flawed emerald of the signet-ring he always wore, striking from it a spark of clear green fire. Odd how one remembered things like that: little things that somehow mattered.<br> &nbsp;<br> (Tramp, tramp, tramp, came the sound of the cohort's feet behind him.)<br> &nbsp;<br> It would be pleasant, he thought, if Uncle' Aquila was like his father. He had not met his uncle yet; after learning his foot-drill he had arrived in Britain in the sleety days of late autumn, and been sent straight up to Isca; but he had a rather vague invitation to spend his leave with him at Calleva, when he had any leave to spend. It would be very pleasant if Uncle Aquila was like his father.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not of course that he and his uncle were likely to have much to do with each other. In a few years' time he would probably be serving in quite a different part of the Empire, since a cohort centurion seldom moved up all the way in the same Legion.<br> &nbsp;<br> All the way ... from his present rank right up to his father's rank of First Cohort; and after that? For most of the men who got <i>so </i>far there was nothing after that, but for the outstanding few who went farther- as Marcus intended to go farther- the ways divided there. One could become a camp commandant, as Uncle Aquila had done, or one could go on, by way of the Praetorian Guard, to try for command of a Legion. Legion Commanders were almost always men of Senator's rank, with no experience of soldiering save a year's service as Military Tribune in their youth; but by long custom the two Egyptian Legions were exceptions to the rule.<br> &nbsp;<br> They were commanded by professional soldiers; and an Egyptian Legion had been Marcus's shining goal for as long as he could remember.<br> &nbsp;<br> But one day, when he had finished with the Eagles, when he had made an honourable name and become Prefect of his Egyptian Legion, he would go home to the Etruscan hills, and perhaps even buy back the old farm, which the plump official had ruthlessly sold to defray expenses. For a moment he remembered almost painfully the sunlit courtyard flickered over with the shadow of pigeons' wings, and the wild olive-tree in the loop of the stream, on a twisted root of which he had once found a kind of gall growing, that was shaped something like a little bird. He had cut it from the root with the new knife his father had given him, and spent much loving care, all one absorbed summer evening, trimming and carving feathers on it. He had that little bird still.<br> &nbsp;<br> The road topped a gentle rise, and suddenly Isca Dumnoniorum lay before them, with the fortress-crowned Red Mount dark with shadows against the evening sky; and Marcus came back to the present with a jerk. The farm in the Etruscan hills could wait until he was old and tired and famous; in the present was the glory of his first command.<br> &nbsp;<br> The British town was spread below the southern scarp of the Mount; a sprawling huddle of reed-thatched roofs, every colour from the gold of honey to the black of dried peat, according to the age of the thatch; with the squared, clean lines of the Roman forum and basilica looking oddly rootless in their midst; and the faint haze of wood-smoke lying over all.<br> &nbsp;<br> The road led straight through the town and up to the cleared slope beyond, to the Praetorian gate of the fort; here and there, crimson- or saffron-cloaked men turned to look at the cohort as it swung by, a look that was reserved rather than hostile. Dogs sat scratching in odd corners, lean pigs rooted among the garbage piles, and women with bracelets of gold or copper on very \vhite arms sat in hut doorways, spinning or grinding corn. The blue smoke of many cooking-fires curled up into the quiet air, and the savoury smell of many evening meals mingled with the blue reek of wood-smoke and the sharper tang of horse-droppings, which Marcus had by now come to associate with all British towns. Little that was Roman was here as yet, despite the stone-built forum. One day there would be straight streets, he supposed, and temples and bath-houses and a Roman way of life. But as yet it was a place where two worlds met without mingling: a British town huddled under the dominion of the turf ramparts where once the tribe had had its stronghold and now the Roman sentries paced up and down. He looked about him under the curve of his helmet as he marched, knowing that this place would be part of his life for the next year; then looked up to the turf ramparts, and saw a Roman banner drooping in the still air, and the tall crest of a sentry burning in the sunset, and heard a trumpet-call ring out, as it seemed, from the fiery sky.</p><h2>Grooming the Next Generation for Success: Proven Strategies for Raising the Next Generation of Leaders</h2><p><p> Raise successful kids today!

Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German theologian and Nazi resister was the exception. This emblematic figure risked his life--and finally lost it--through his participation in a failed plot to assassinate Hitler and topple his regime. Saints and Villains gives us this exemplary life in a sweeping narrative that is bold in conception and utterly convincing in its power of imaginative reconstruction.</p><p>Sometimes the universe produces a man or woman whose life seems ready-made for fiction: Joan of Arc, for example, or Robert Falcon Scott; John Brown, Martin Luther King Jr., or Jesus of Nazareth. Fiction writers are attracted to larger-than-life personalities and each of the above-mentioned luminaries have indeed appeared in fictional works. Now German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer joins their ranks in Denise Giardina's novel <i>Saints and Sinners</i>. Bonhoeffer was born in 1906 in Breslau, Germany. As a young man, he found his vocation in the church, and his theological education took him to England, Spain, and eventually New York, where he spent a year in post-doctoral studies at Union Theological Seminary. He returned to Germany imbued with both the ideals of ecumenicalism and of the Church's responsibility to participate in social and political debate. These ideals, unfortunately, were hardly compatible with the rise of Nazism in the Germany of the '30s and '40s. Bonnhoeffer, true to his beliefs, spoke out against the Nazi regime, and participated in Germany's small Protestant resistance. He was eventually arrested for helping Jews escape to Switzerland and was hanged in the concentration camp in Flossenberg in the waning days of the war. <p> Denise Giardina knows the stuff of drama when she sees it, and in writing this fictionalized account of Bonhoeffer's life and death, she has drawn heavily on his own writings. Though she sticks to the facts where chronology is concerned, she does introduce three fictional characters into her protagonist's life as a means of illuminating his most private aspects. There is Elisabeth Hildebrant, Bonhoeffer's Jewish lover; Alois Bauer, his Nazi nemesis; and Fred Bishop, a black American seminarian Bonhoeffer meets during his year in New York who serves to politicize and radicalize the German theologian. After reading <i>Saints and Sinners</i>, readers might want to take a look at Bonhoeffer's <i>Letters and Papers from Prison</i>, written during the last two years of his life, for a taste of the real man.</p>IN THE CHARNEL HOUSE THAT WAS EUROPE IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR, THERE WERE FEW INSTANCES OF SHINING MORAL COURAGE, LET ALONE SECULAR SAINTHOOD. DIETRICH BONHOEFFER, THE GERMAN THEOLOGIAN AND NAZI RESISTER, WAS THE EXCEPTION. THIS EMBLEMATIC FIGURE RISKED HIS LIFE -- AND FINALLY LOST IT -- THROUGH HIS PARTICIPATION IN A FAILED PLOT TO ASSASSINATE HITLER AND TOPPLE HIS REGIME.

Within six months his stories appeared in Harper&#39;s, Esquire, Mirabella, Story, Buzz, and in The New Yorker twice more. &#34;The Pugilist at Rest&#34; - the title story from this stunning collection - took first place in Prize Stories 1993: The O. Henry Awards and was selected for inclusion in Best American Short Stories 1992. He is a writer of astonishing talent. Jones&#39;s stories - whether set in the combat zones of Vietnam or the brittle social and intellectual milieu of an elite New England college, whether recounting the poignant last battles of an alcoholic ex-fighter or the hallucinatory visions of an American wandering lost in Bombay in the aftermath of an epileptic fugue - are fueled by an almost brutal vision of the human condition, in a world without mercy or redemption. Physically battered, soul-sick, and morally exhausted, Jones&#39;s characters are yet unable to concede defeat: his stories are infused with the improbable grace of the spirit that ought to collapse, but cannot. For in these extraordinary pieces of fiction, it is not goodness that finally redeems us, but the heart&#39;s illogical resilience, and the ennobling tenacity with which we cling to each other and to our lives. The publication of The Pugilist at Rest is a major literary event, heralding the arrival of an electrifying new voice in American fiction, and a writer of magnificent depth and range. With these eleven stories, Thom Jones takes his place among the ranks of this country&#39;s most important authors.</p><p>Thom Jones's first collection of stories is a revelation. In prose that sounds like nobody else, Jones channels a variety of distinctively different voices, from the lustful book editor of "Unchain My Heart" to the epileptic, amnesiac adman of the Dostoevskian fable "A White Horse." There's not a miss among these tales, but two in particular stand out: the title story, about a boxer and Vietnam vet who has plumbed the vicious depths of his own soul, and the almost unbearably intense chronicle of a woman fighting a losing battle with cancer, "I Want to Live!" "The world is replete with badness," says the aging fighter of "A Pugilist at Rest"; yet, as the narrator of "I Want to Live!" discovers, there is nothing stronger than the human will to go on, to <i>persist</i>--even in the face of the hell that exists right here on earth. It's not all gloom, doom, and napalm, however. There's also the surreal, Gogol-esque humor of "The Black Lights," in which the pysch-ward protagonist insists his only problem is epilepsy, yet hallucinates a giant, shuddering rabbit caught under his bed at night ("It's that rabbit on the Br'er Rabbit molasses jar. That rabbit with buckles on his shoes! Bow tie. Yaller teeth! Yaller! Yaller!") Then, too, Jones creates images of startling, surreal clarity amid the horror, like the dying lieutenant who remains on one knee even after being shot, "his remaining arm extended out to the enemy, palm upward in the soulful, heartrending gesture of Al Jolson doing a rendition of 'Mammy.'" Take a decidedly grim world-view, add a dose of existential slapstick, some Schopenhauer, an encyclopedic knowledge of pharmaceuticals, and a soundtrack by the Doors, and you have what may be the darkest, funniest, most urgent fictional debut in years. <i>--Mary Park</i>Jones, a former marine and amateur boxer, recently published short stories in The New Yorker and Harper's. The themes dominating his first collection are violence, adultery, alcoholism, epilepsy, and madness. The sheer visceral intensity of Jones's prose is amplified by the sensitivity with which his characters are drawn: a soldier in Vietnam recognizes his capacity for violence in an ancient Roman statue; an abusive womanizer reacts with instinctive viciousness when he falls in love; a janitor attempts to lure a slow student from a potentially disastrous relationship; a dying woman finds solace in the pessimistic philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Jones's gritty yet refined prose stands in sharp contrast to the more apologetic work of National Book Award winner Tim O'Brien ( Going After Cacciato , LJ 12/15/77; The Things They Carried , LJ 2/15/90), with whom critical comparison is inevitable. This outstanding collection is sure to be in demand in public libraries.<br><i>- Mark Annichiarico, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Birdsongs</h2><p><b>The sky is quiet.</b> <br> <br> The yard is quiet. <br> <br> The creek is quietly gurgling. <br> <br> Then...<i>tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat!</i> A red-capped woodpecker starts his rap for the day.

At sunrise, a woodpecker "raps a tap dance with his beak, pecking 10 times as he looks for breakfast bugs."

Each successive spread features a different type of bird with a declining number of utterances. For example, mourning doves land on a telephone wire and "coo" to one another nine times; sparrows crowd around a bird feeder and emit eight "chirps." At day's end, a mockingbird mimics all of the songs she has heard, resulting in a true cacophony of sounds (and a fun challenge for reading aloud). In his vivid, realistic-looking collages, Jenkins uses accurate textures and colors for each species, and creates the appearance of depth, light, and warmth (the chickadees, described as making a tree look "like a candelabra," are divine). The writing is lyrical and engaging, and quick "feathery facts" about the creatures are appended. This book, which pairs nicely with Aileen Fisher's <i>Know What I Saw?</i> (Roaring Brook, 2005) and Ann Jonas's <i>Bird Talk</i> (Greenwillow, 1999), will engender a love for birds and an awareness of their unique music.&#x2014;<i>Teresa Pfeifer, Alfred Zanetti Montessori Magnet School, Springfield, MA</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"With this book of poems Etel Adnan establishes herself as a major poet who belongs beside internationally acclaimed poets like Transtrï¿½mer, Bly, Neruda, Vallejo, and Pessoa."&#x2014;Eric Sellin</p><p>&#34;The Spring Flower&#39;s Own&#34; represents a new kind of epic poetry: the fragility and the strength of flowers are played against the drama of a woman&#39;s experience. &#34;The Manifestations of the Voyage&#34; describes the odyssey of a woman&#39;s soul. Through what appears to be a series of death and resurrection cycles within a single existence, a truth is reached, startling in its simplicity: life is an ongoing revelation.Etel Adnan was born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1925, the daughter of a Greek Christian from Smyrna and a high- ranking Ottoman officer from Damascus. Her work as a whole is a faithful record of the times and places she has lived in Beirut, Paris, and in the San Francisco Bay Area. At least eighteen works by Adnan have been published in English. They include SITT MARIE ROSE (Post-Apollo Press, 1982); THE ARAB APOCALYPSE (Post-Apollo Press, 1989); SEA AND FOG (Nightboat Books, 2012), winner of the Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Poetry and the California Book Award for Poetry; and PREMONITION (Kelsey Street Press, 2014). Nightboat Books published the 2-volume set, TO LOOK AT THE SEA IS TO BECOME WHAT ONE IS: AN ETEL ADNAN READER, in 2014. In 2011, Adnan received Small Press Traffic's Lifetime Achievement Award. Her paintings, described by New York Times art critic Roberta Smith as "stubbornly radiant abstractions," have been widely exhibited, most recently at Documenta 13 and in the 2014 Whitney Biennial. Spanning media and genres, Adnan's writings have led to numerous collaborations with artists and musicians, including the French part of <em>CIVIL WarS</em>, a multi-language opera by American stage director Robert Wilson, performed in Lyon and Bobigny in 1985.</p><h2>The Odes of Horace</h2><p><p>The Latin poet Horace is, along with his friend Virgil, the most celebrated of the poets of the reign of the Emperor Augustus, and, with Virgil, the most influential.

This time she roamed the world, taking lessons and courses in such things as French cooking in Paris, Border collie training in Scotland, traditional Japanese arts in Kyoto, and architecture and art in Havana. With warmth and wit, Steinbach guides us through the pleasures and perils of discovering how to be a student again.

She lives in Baltimore.Cookin' at the Ritz<br><br>A light snow was falling as I left my hotel and hurried across the narrow rue Cambon to the employees entrance of the Hotel Ritz. It surprised me that I had learned only two days earlier that such a door even existed. How, I wondered, in all my years of exploring the streets and passages of Paris had I missed it? After all, back doors were a major interest of mine. And so were side doors and courtyards hidden behind green gates and anything else that concealed the private Paris from me. Once, I spent two years writing letters and making phone calls before being allowed to visit the mysterious Maison de Verre, a house on the Left Bank designed in the late 1920s by the French architect Pierre Chareau. Compared to that heroic effort, gaining entrance to the back door of the Hotel Ritz was a snap: I had simply enrolled as a culinary student in the Ritz Escoffier ï¿½cole de Gastronomie Franï¿½aise.<br><br>Now here I was, on a snowy morning in February, about to enter the hotel not as an outsider but as an insider, a thrilling prospect. After all, I told myself, anyone willing and able to pay seven hundred dollars a pop to stay overnight could walk through the Ritz's imposing place Vendï¿½me entrance. But only those carrying an employee's identification card were allowed through the back door on rue Cambon. Still, as eager as I was to begin what seemed an adventure, the truth is I was nervous about what to expect on the other side of the door. A French security officer who would turn me away? A snooty chef who would laugh at my limited French vocabulary? Classmates who would criticize my chopping and dicing techniques? A sudden, humiliating announcement from the schools Directeur that, for undisclosed reasons, he had revoked my student status?<br><br>It was in this Kafkaesque frame of mind that I pushed open the plain unmarked door and stepped into a small vestibule. A security guard sitting in a small room behind a counter stood up and carefully gave me the once-over. Immediately his stern appraising demeanor made me think of my root canal dentist.<br><br>"Bonjour," I said with fake nonchalance, holding out my photo ID in such a way that my thumb covered any evidence of a very bad haircut. He nodded and reached for the card. I watched as he looked at it and frowned. Was it my bad haircut that offended? "Is something wrong?" I asked. His response was to look at my face and then at the photo, comparing the two. He repeated this twice. Face-then-photo. Face-then-photo. Just as I started to explain that I'd drastically altered my hairstyle-for the better-since the photo was taken, a buzzer went off. A clicking sound followed as the gate to the long basement corridor unlocked and, with a wave of his hand, the guard motioned me through.<br><br>So this was it, then, the moment when I became a part of the venerable Hotel Ritz. After descending a flight of stairs, I looked down a corridor so long I couldn't see the end of it. What I could see, however, was a small army of employees engaged in a whirlwind of activity. Fascinated, I watched as men in crisp white uniforms picked up crates containing hundreds of bottles of Evian water and florists pushed carts filled with lavish arrangements of lilies, tulips, and irises. As I moved deeper into the corridor I saw workmen carting off worn pieces of Persian rugs and cabinetmakers moving a hand-painted Chinese chest marked "For repair." Service staff carrying covered silver breakfast trays entered and exited the service elevator. Some of the employees nodded to me in a collegial way as they passed by. I nodded back, trying to conceal my excitement at witnessing all the daily routines necessary to run a world-class hotel.<br><br>I continued on through the long corridor, past the sparkling white tile and stainless-steel kitchen classrooms of the cooking school, to the locker rooms where students changed into their uniforms. After a few minutes of struggling with the key, I unlocked the door on the right marked "Women." When I opened it a blast of hot, steamy air hit me; it smelled like the warm dampness I breathed as a child when changing clothes in the locker room of the YWCA pool.<br><br>Inside the small, L-shaped room there were thirty-five bright blue lockers, a few narrow benches, and an adjoining space with a toilet, a shower stall, two sinks, and a mirror. On a small table in the corner someone had left a hair comb and a large roll of Tums-a bad omen, perhaps, to find in the locker room of a cooking school. After locating the locker assigned to me-Number 210-I opened it and saw hanging inside the uniform I'd been fitted for on the previous day. The room was empty so I began to undress quickly, hoping to finish suiting up before my classmates arrived. Call me insecure, but I preferred not to meet my colleagues for the first time wearing only my underwear.<br><br>The uniform was formidable. First, I removed the sturdy closed-toe shoes students were advised to wear and stepped out of my khaki pants. Then I pulled on a pair of heavy cotton houndstooth-check trousers. My sweater came off next. It was replaced by a starched white double-breasted chef's jacket with double rows of buttons and the name of the school embroidered in blue on the left. Then came the napkin-like neckerchief that had to be tied in a very specific way. Next, I wrapped a starched white apron around my waist, tied it in front, and then tucked a thick white side towel under the apron string on my left side. By this time I was perspiring heavily.<br><br>Finally it was time to don the flat, starched white hat worn by students. I approached the hat with some trepidation. I still had not gotten over the humiliation of being told by the sympathetic French laundress who fitted me that I would require a very large hat. "A size 21," she said sadly. "There is no larger." Also I had no idea of how to wear this hat. Pushed back on my head like a beanie with hair showing? Or pulled down over my forehead, just above the eyebrows? Either way, it was not a becoming look. I decided to wear it in the more severe position: very low on my forehead, almost to my eyebrows, with all my hair covered. Somehow, it seemed more professional that way.<br><br>I looked at my watch; it had taken twenty minutes to suit up. I made a brief detour to the mirror and stopped to stare at myself. The person staring back, the one who was supposed to resemble a culinary student, looked in fact like a Red Army nurse, circa World War II. Actually I sort of liked the look. I fancied myself as looking very much like the Hemingway heroine in A Farewell to Arms, despite the fact she wasn't Russian and the story had nothing to do with World War II.<br><br>To complete the uniform I pinned on the nametag which, I had been warned at my fitting, "should in all cases be worn every day."<br><br>With half an hour to kill I headed for the employees' cafeteria, where I was entitled to eat at a student discount. The pretty, softly lit room was almost empty, so I sat down with a cup of latte and studied the dishes we would prepare over the next four and a half hours: sole fillets with a mandarin sauce; boeuf Bourguignon, waffle potatoes, soufflï¿½ed potatoes, chocolate and orange mousse. We would also learn to prepare meat glaze and demi-glace. I flipped the pages containing the recipes, trying to familiarize myself with the conversion of measurements and weights from the European metric system into its American equivalent, a daunting task. Added to that was the further hurdle presented by having the course conducted in French with simultaneous translation into English. Between the foreign metric conversion and the foreign language translation, I saw the potential for big mistakes.<br><br>Indeed I had spent the night before worrying about whether I would measure up to the standards of the Ritz Escoffier Cooking School. After all it had been more than twenty years since I'd studied classic French cooking and almost as long since I'd cooked at that level. So, to be on the safe side, I had enrolled in a course listed in the school's brochure as designed for the "beginner to intermediate student." Still, the name alone-The Cï¿½sar Ritz Course,-named after the hotel's founder-was intimidating to someone who grew up in a Scottish household where Grandmother dragged out the Wee Scottish Cookbook when company was coming and a fancy dish like steak pie or leek soup was called for.<br><br>I worried too about meeting my nine classmates, all of whom had started the six-week course together, beginning in Week One. I, on the other hand-having neither the time nor money for the full course-chose the option of starting halfway through the course in Week Four. What this meant, of course, was that I was the New Girl in Class, subject to all the disadvantages accruing to such an identity.<br><br>Kitchens are dangerous places. Within minutes of beginning our classroom work, two students caught on fire. Or to be more precise, their long side towels caught on fire. Real chefs, it turned out, don't use potholders. When something hot has to be handled they use their sturdy side towels. Which is exactly what Bruce and Paulina were doing-removing a huge stainless-steel pot of fish stock from the gas burner-when flames erupted. The blaze was put out quickly and no one seemed concerned. Except me.</p><h2>Renoir, My Father (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>In this delightful memoir, Jean Renoir, the director of such masterpieces of the cinema as <i>Grand Illusion</i> and <i>The Rules of the Game</i>, tells the life story of his father, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, the great Impressionist painter.

The philosophical basis for his work in integrative medicine and optimum health, <i>Health and Healing</i> draws on Weil&#x2019;s own vast clinical and personal experience, as well as on case studies from around the world.</p><p>Why do we get sick? How do we get well? How do we avoid getting sick again? Dr. Andrew Weil attempts to answer these fundamental questions in <i>Health and Healing</i>, but the real joy of the book isn't in learning the answers, but in following his mind down the path to an answer.<p> He starts with homeopathy, a treatment that, to an outsider, seems more like a leap of faith than an actual system of healing. Weil recounts how homeopathy cured--<i>completely</i> cured--an annoying intestinal problem he suffered. Then he discusses the principles and history of this type of treatment, including the surprising ways in which homeopathy has affected the course of modern medicine. Finally, he gets to the real question: does homeopathy work or is it simply a placebo effect? The only reasonable answer is "maybe," but accompanying Weil as he gets to that answer is a fascinating experience.</p><p> One of the strongest points made in this book is that "perfect health" is simply unattainable. We're all going to feel bad sometimes. Another is that the body eventually heals most of its injuries, illnesses, and infections--up to 90 percent of them, by some estimates. But it's the other 10 percent that raise havoc. Weil, trained as a medical doctor, believes that conventional medicine is great at handling trauma and sudden, life-threatening conditions like heart attacks, but it's less good at dealing with chronic conditions like arthritis. <i>Health and Healing</i> examines the strengths and weaknesses of both conventional and alternative medicine, and offers a roadmap to determine which is best for what ails you. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>Andrew Weil, M.D., has degrees in biology and medicine from Harvard University. Author of the best-selling Spontaneous Healing and Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, he traveled the world experiencing and studying healers and healing systems and has earned an international reputation as an expert on alternative medicine, mind-body interactions, and medical botany.

As one served American expansion by promoting Indian dispossession and religious conversion, and the other struggled to defend and strengthen Indian territories, the two friends became bitter enemies. Their battle over control of the Indian borderland, that divided ground between the British Empire and the nascent United States, would come to define nationhood in North America. Taylor tells a fascinating story of the far-reaching effects of the American Revolution and the struggle of American Indians to preserve a land of their own.</p><p>Alan Taylor received his B.A. from Colby College and his Ph.D. from Brandeis University. He has taught at Colby College, the College of William &amp; Mary, Boston University, and the University of California at Davis, where he is Professor of History. He is the author of <i>Liberty Men and Great Proprietors: The Revolutionary Settlement on the Maine Frontier, 1760-1820 (1990)</i>; <i>William Cooper's Town: Power and Persuasion on the Frontier of the Early American Republic (1996)</i>, and <i>American Colonies: The Settlement of North America (The Penguin History of the United States, Vol. 1, 2001)</i>.Property<br><br> In July 1761, as Joseph Brant traveled east to join Wheelock&#x2019;s school, Sir William Johnson headed west, ascending the Mohawk River into the country of the Six Nations. his five boats hauled thirty-eight soldiers, their equipment, and presents for the Indians. The traveling party also included his nineteen-year-old son, John, and their cousin and secretary, Guy Johnson. In high spirits, the Johnsons anticipated a victory tour in Indian country to consolidate the recent British conquest of French Canada. With the French banished from North America, British officials expected easily to control the Indians.<br><br> Instead, Johnson found pervasive Indian dread and disgust, even among the nearby Mohawks, who had so long cooperated with him. As British allies, the Mohawks had lost about 100 warriors, half of their men, during the recent war with the French. In return for that heavy sacrifice, the Mohawks expected Johnson to protect their villages against conniving land speculators and encroaching settlers. Frustrated in that expectation, the Mohawks complained bitterly to Johnson, who reported that they felt in &#x201c;danger of being made slaves, and having their lands taken from them at pleasure, which they added would confirm what the French have often told the Six Nations.&#x201d;<br><br> Preaching patience, Johnson promised justice to the Mohawks&#x2014;but New York&#x2019;s leaders and settlers kept breaking his every promise. Fed up, the Mohawks threatened to move away deeper within Indian country. That possibility delighted settlers and speculators who lusted after Mohawk land, but alarmed Johnson, who relied on his special Mohawk connection to influence the Six Nations. Without nearby and content Mohawks as allies, his superintendency would become impotent.<br><br> Proceeding upriver beyond the Mohawk country, Johnson reached German Flats, colonial New York&#x2019;s westernmost settlement. There, Johnson met Oneidas, who also bitterly complained of encroaching settlers. The chief Conoghquieson warned Johnson that the Oneida settlers would fight rather than lose their lands. Instead of consolidating British power over the Indians, the conquest of Canada threatened to unravel the alliance with the Six Nations that was essential to frontier security.<br><br> In helping the British to attack Canada, the Iroquois had miscalculated, for they had never expected such a rapid and complete collapse by the French forces. No longer could the Indians play off the French against the British to maintain Iroquois independence, to maximize their presents, and to ensure trade competition. A British general explained, &#x201c;They saw us sole Masters of the Country, the Balance of Power broke, and their own Consequence at an End. Instead of being courted by two Nations, a Profusion of Presents made by both, and two Markets to trade at, they now depend upon one Power.&#x201d; That dependence exposed Iroquoia to land-hungry colonists.<br><br> THE SIX NATIONS<br><br> The Iroquois pursued a mixed subsistence strategy combining horticulture, gathering, fishing, and hunting. In fields of fertile, alluvial soil, they cultivated mounds of maize topped by climbing beans and surrounded by low-lying squashes and pumpkins. After the fall harvest, the natives dispersed into the hills, occupying many small camps, tended by women, while the men pursued bear, deer, and beaver for meat and pelts. Returning to their villages, they spent the early spring collecting maple sap to make a brown sugar. After planting their crops in May, the Iroquois spent June and July in fishing camps strung along the lakes and streams. Having exhausted the previous year&#x2019;s harvest, the people sought relief by catching eels, salmon, trout, and whitefish. During that hungry season, the women and children also gathered wild onions, followed by strawberries, raspberries, whortleberries, and blackberries. From the forest floor, they also harvested ginseng for sale to colonial merchants.<br><br> This mobile, but seasonally patterned, way of life conserved most of the forest and streams&#x2014;and their wild things&#x2014;over the generations. Native use contrasted with the colonists&#x2019; drive to clear most of the forest to provide pastures for cattle and fields for grain. Compared to the colonists, the Iroquois used land extensively rather than intensively. The natives did clear and cultivate compact fields near their villages, but they kept most of their domain as a forest to sustain wild plants and animals. To colonial eyes, the Iroquois peoples wasted their land by keeping a wilderness; but the Indians exploited their domain in ways that the colonists did not understand.<br><br> Most colonists disdained the Iroquois as improvident, living from hand to mouth for want of incentives for accumulating private property. Indeed, the Iroquois considered it foolish and demeaning to labor beyond what they needed to subsist. Sir William noted, &#x201c;The Indians are a Lazy people, &amp; naturally Enemies to Labour.&#x201d; But colonial charges of Indian indolence focused on men seen during the warm months in their villages or on visits to colonial towns: periods and places of male inactivity and heavy drinking. Colonial observers rarely saw Indian men during their strenuous winter hunts, when they endured severe hardships pursuing game for miles over rugged terrain in bitter weather. The colonial view also discounted the evident industry of native women in cultivating and gathering, which the colonists treated as exploitation by lazy husbands and fathers.<br><br> John Heckewelder, a missionary, noted that the Indians disliked the competitive and acquisitive values of the colonists: &#x201c;They wonder that the white people are striving so much to get rich, and to heap up treasures in this world which they cannot carry with them to the next.&#x201d;<br><br> They cherished the collective security maintained by expecting generosity from the fortunate to the needy. Instead of storing up wealth, prospering chiefs accumulated prestige by gifts to their kin and to the hungry and ragged. These values of hospitality and reciprocity spread resources through the seasons and across a village, sustaining a rough equality. No one starved in an Iroquois village unless all did so.<br><br> If paltry by colonial standards, the material wants of the Iroquois exceeded those of their ancestors. The eighteenth-century Iroquois relied upon traders to provide European manufactured goods that exceeded the Indian technology to make. In return for furs, the Iroquois procured metal knives, hatchets, axes, hoes, and kettles&#x2014;all vastly better than their stone and wood predecessors. And with cloth, mirrors, glass and silver jewelry, and alcohol, the traders provided new luxuries to the Indians. Above all, they needed guns, gunpowder, and metal shot for hunting and war. Dependence on that imported technology also entailed an Indian reliance on colonial blacksmiths and gunsmiths to repair metal tools and weapons.<br><br> In personal appearance, the Iroquois conveyed a mix of tradition and adaptation, of America and Europe, of subsistence and commerce, and of ease and pride. Except for moccasins on their feet, the Iroquois donned more British cloth than traditional buckskin. In warm weather, men wore little more than a loose, linen shirt over their shoulders and a loincloth held by a leather belt. Women&#x2019;s attire consisted of a linen shirt and a cotton petticoat. In colder weather, both men and women wrapped themselves in woolen blankets, while men covered their lower limbs with leather leggings. Both genders delighted in abundant jewelry, especially silver worn as bracelets, gorgets, rings, and earrings. Women and older men wore their hair long, but warriors shaved the sides of their head to leave a scalp lock on top. The young men also plucked their facial hair out by the roots.<br><br> Gender and age, rather than social class, structured Iroquois labor. Assisted by children, women tended the crops and gathered the wild plants, while men fished, hunted, waged war, and conducted diplomacy. Men&#x2019;s activities took them deep into the forest and far from the villages. Consequently, those villages and their fields belonged to the women, the enduring people of the community. They controlled the harvest and determined the location of their village.<br><br> No land could be forsaken without their consent. In 1763, the Mohawks explained to Johnson that women were &#x201c;the Truest Owners, being the persons who labour on the Lands.&#x201d; The Mohawk matrons then assured Johnson that &#x201c;they would keep their Land, and did not chuse to part with the same to be reduced to make Brooms.&#x201d; The Mohawks well knew the Algonquian Indians of the Hudson Valley and New England as negative reference points: as native peoples who had lost most of their lands and become the impoverished makers of brooms and baskets for colonial consumers.<br><br> Chiefs<br><br> The Iroquois dispersed and divided political power from a dread of coercion. They understood the world as constantly embroiled in a struggle between the forces of good and evil, of life and death, of peace and war. Because those conflicts raged within every nation, village, and person, all forms of power had to be dispersed and closely watched to preserve the freedom of a people.<br><br> An Iroquois nation was an ethnic and linguistic group divided into several jealous villages and subdivided by internal factions led by rival chiefs. Although one village usually was a bit larger and more prestigious, hosting the council fire of the nation, the chiefs there could only admonish and advise, but never command, their fellow people in other, smaller villages. No nation was united under the rule of a single headman, although one chief might enjoy more honor as the keeper of sacred objects&#x2014;principally wampum belts&#x2014;and as the host of public councils. Instead of representing an entire village (much less the collective nation), a chief represented a particular clan, which the Iroquois called &#x201c;a tribe.&#x201d; Most Iroquois nations had three clans (or tribes): Bear, Wolf, and Turtle. A clan consisted of several extended families, related through the maternal line: matrilineages. Johnson noted that a chief&#x2019;s clout depended on &#x201c;the number of Warriors under his influence, which are seldom more than his own relations.&#x201d;<br><br> The proper chief had been accomplished in war but mellowed by time, becoming eloquent, patient, tactful, dignified, and methodical. The duty of a chief was to keep his head while others were losing theirs. In 1765, Sayenqueraghta, a Seneca, described the ideal chief as &#x201c;a wise, dispassionate man [who] thinks much &amp; thinks slowly, with great caution &amp; deliberation, before he speaks his whole mind.&#x201d; A proper chief worked to soothe the discontented, to calm troubles, and to keep the peace by sage advice. Unable to command people, the chief exercised influence through persuasion, which rested upon his prestige, example, and reason. A bullying chief risked his life to assassination by disgruntled warriors.<br><br> The clan chiefs (or &#x201c;sachems&#x201d;) had to share village authority with warriors and matrons. The senior women of the matrilineages chose the chiefs who represented their clan on the village council. Although birth within the proper matrilineage mattered, the clan mothers favored merit and personality in determining their choice. In effect, chiefs were so many male ambassadors, representing matrilineages. Once chosen, a chief ordinarily served for life, but an incompetent could be ousted by the matrons of his clan.<br><br> Chiefs promoted harmony and peace, but they could not always succeed&#x2014;especially beyond the nation among outsiders without kinship ties to the Iroquois. Consequently, the people also needed to summon the darker powers of their young warriors. They could not, and should not, possess the chiefly virtues of calm forbearance. Instead, warriors needed to be decisive, violent, cruel, and proud&#x2014;quick to take offense and terrible in seeking vengeance. Without formidable warriors, no people could remain free. In theory, chiefs restrained warriors, but ambitious young men longed for the honors of war to demonstrate their courage and prowess. Bristling under restraint by their chiefs, warriors sometimes forced a war by raiding foes or by killing their emissaries. But women could compel the warriors to make peace by withholding the food needed for long-distance raids.<br><br> Within their villages, the Iroquois dreaded contention and coercion, preferring the deliberative search for consensus, however elusive. That search led to highly formalized speeches in public council by chiefs closely watched by all the villagers. If those deliberations failed to reach an acceptable consensus, the people agreed to disagree, permitting factions and families to chart varying courses. For example, during the imperial wars, the Oneidas disagreed on a common front, so some helped the French and others the British, while most clung to neutrality.<br><br> If a village majority did commit to a provocative decision, the disgruntled voted with their feet by moving away. Over the years, village populations ebbed and surged as some people moved out and others moved in. Driven by the elusive ideal of consensus, this fission helped to sustain that ideal&#x2014;if not the reality&#x2014;by temporarily ridding villages of the most discontented.<br><br> The lack of coercive power within the Six Nations frustrated colonial officials who hoped to command the Indians by co-opting their chiefs. Early and often, those chiefs tried to explain their limited influence over hotheaded warriors or over another village. Indeed, a chief lost influence if he did colonial bidding by coercing his own people. Johnson eventually gave up trying to mandate head chiefs for each of the Six Nations, explaining that &#x201c;the extreme jealousy which the Northern Indians entertain of one another would render a particular choice of any one of them unserviceable; and make his Nation pay no regard to him.&#x201d; Noting that chiefs had greater power in the past, or at a distance from the settlements, Johnson concluded that colonial meddling had weakened authority in Indian villages. But, of course, Johnson was the consummate meddler.<br><br> The imperial wars diminished the authority of the sachems. Eager to recruit warriors, colonial leaders treated the war chiefs as the real locus of power in an Iroquois village. Consequently, they could drive hard bargains to secure abundant presents including weapons and ammunition. By redistributing this largesse to their followers, war chiefs built their influence at the expense of the sachems. Indeed, warriors and their war chiefs waxed increasingly arrogant. In 1762, the Seneca war chiefs assured Johnson: &#x201c;We are in fact the People of Consequence for Managing Affairs, Our Sachems being generally a parcell of Old People who say Much, but who Mean or Act very little.&#x201d;<br><br> From a colonial perspective, the Iroquois lived in virtual anarchy&#x2014;owing to the crisscrossing interests of chiefs, warriors, and women; the elusive ideal of consensus; and the powerful animus against coercion. And yet, native villages were remarkably harmonious&#x2014;except when alcohol abounded. Heckewelder noted, &#x201c;They have no written laws, but they have usages founded on the most strict principles of equity and justice. . . . They are peaceable, sociable, obliging, charitable, and hospitable among themselves.&#x201d; Their public councils were di...</p><h2>The Mirror of Mindfulness</h2><p>This book main idea is that intrinsic to the heart, mind and spirit in every human being is an identical essence which can be realized.

Why have medicine when sick, if one doesn`t use it? Without training, our studies become mere intellectual understanding.

A rebel against the Catholic tradition in which he was raised, Althusser studied philosophy and later joined both the faculty of the Ecole normal superieure and the French Communist Party in 1948. Viewed as a "structuralist Marxist," Althusser was as much admired for his independence of intellect as he was for his rigorous defense of Marx. The latter was best illustrated in <i>For Marx</i> (1965), and <i>Reading Capital</i> (1968). These works, along with <i>Lenin and Philosophy </i>(1971) had an enormous influence on the New Left of the 1960s and continues to influence modern Marxist scholarship.</p> <p>This classic work, which to date has sold more than 30,000 copies, covers the range of Louis Althusser's interests and contributions in philosophy, economics, psychology, aesthetics, and political science.</p> <p>Marx, in Althusser's view, was subject in his earlier writings to the ruling ideology of his day.

A superbly detailed account of the ideological escalation . . . that brought Americans to revolution." &#x2015;Gordon S.

She follows the American Whigs as they moved by stages from the organized resistance of the Stamp Act crisis of 1765 through the non-importation associations of the late 1760s to the collapse of royal government after 1773, the implication of the king in a conspiracy against American liberties, and the consequent Declaration of Independence.

The family&#x2019;s story starts with Hoonie, a young Korean man born with physical deformities, but whose destiny comes from his inner strength and kindness. Hoonie&#x2019;s daughter, rather than bring shame on her family, leaves their homeland for Japan, where her children and grandchildren will be born and raised; yet prejudice against their Korean heritage will prevent them from ever feeling at home. In <em>Pachinko</em>, Min Jin Lee says much about success and suffering, prejudice and tradition, but the novel never bogs down and only becomes richer, like a sauce left simmering hour after hour.

He dispels once and for all the common notion of native New England as peopled by a handful of savages wandering in a trackless wilderness. In sketching the picture the author has had help from such early explorers as Verrazano, Champlain, John Smith, and a score of literate sailors; Pilgrims and Puritans; settlers, travelers, military men, and missionaries. A surprising number of these took time and trouble to write about the new land and the characteristics and way of life of its native people. A second major background source has been the patient investigations of modern archaeologists and scientists, whose several enthusiastic organizations sponsor physical excavations and publications that continually add to our perception of prehistoric men and women, their habits, and their environment. This account of the earlier New Englanders, of their land and how they lived in it and treated it; their customs, food, life, means of livelihood, and philosophy of life will be of interest to all general audiences concerned with the history of Native Americans and of New England.</p><p>6 x 9 trim. 15 illus. 46 figs. LC 79-63082HOWARD S. RUSSELL had a lifelong interest in New England&#39;s earliest inhabitants, dating back to boyhood discoveries of occasional Indian artifacts in his family&#39;s plowed fields. This led him over the last half century to a systematic examination of every account left by early explorers and observers, every reference in regional or local histories or archaeological writings; to discussions with informed persons; and to making numerous visits to Indian village sites and museums. From this wide variety of sources, therefore, he has set down this illustrated account of New England&#39;s earliest settlers. Mr. Russell was author of the widely-acclaimed A Long, Deep Furrow: Three Centuries of Farming in New England (UPNE, 1976), about which Smithsonian said &#34;A readable and splendid account . . . &#39;sweep&#39; is not too grand a word for this rich and meticulous manuscript.&#34;</p><h2>Skywriting by Word of Mouth : And Other Writings, Including &#34;The Ballad of John and Yoko&#34;</h2><p><p> John Lennon wrote <i>Skywriting by Word of Mouth</i>, an impressive collection of writings and drawings, during Yoko Ono's pregnancy with Sean, and always planned to have it published. The book's publication was a wish that seemed to end with Lennon's assassination in 1980 and the theft of the manuscript from the Lennons' home in 1982. When it was recovered and first published in 1986, <i>Skywriting</i> received immediate critical and popular acclaim. Filled with Lennon's extraordinary creative powers and lavishly illustrated with his own drawings, the collection reveals his fertile creative spirit up close and in full force. Included in <i>Skywriting</i> are "Two Virgins," written when the public learned that John and Yoko were living together as husband and wife, and John's only autobiography, "The Ballad of John and Yoko." In addition there are notes on his falling in love with Yoko, the breakup of the Beatles, his persecution by U.S. authorities, and his withdrawal from public life. This is a book with John Lennon's spirit on every pageï¿½a spirit the world needs to remember. </p></p><p>&#x201c;John wrote Skywriting at a time when the world was wondering whatever happened to him. Why wasn&#x2019;t he writing songs anymore? Well, this is what he was busy doing... I&#x2019;m glad that I can now share these writings with you. I&#x2019;m sure John would be, too.&#x201d; (Yoko Ono (from the afterword))<br><br>&#x201c;Had he never sung a note, John Lennon still might have made his mark - as a successor to Lewis Carroll, James Joyce, and other brilliantly playful molders and expanders of the English language.&#x201d; (Los Angeles Times)<br><br>&#x201c;Candid and scathing...A reflection of its author&#x2019;s creativity and enduring appeal.&#x201d; (People)<br><br>&#x201c;Skywriting is a thrill... Lennon at his best.&#x201d; (San Jose Mercury News)<br><br>&#x201c;It is no wonder John Lennon&#x2019;s fans grow more in love with him as time goes by...His great influence on popular music makes him impossible to forget, so does this book.&#x201d; (Houston Chronicle)<br><br>&#x201c;Marvelous, delightful reading and for John Lennon fans a must.&#x201d; (Publishers Weekly)YA John Lennon was a paradox. Underneath the hard living celebrity persona lurked a totally different individual. His writings in Skywriting by Word of Mouth reflect the transition period during which he met Yoko Ono and realized that he wanted to leave the Beatles. He is honest about personal mistakes and his abuse of drugs. His writings are candid, witty, enlightened, and sarcastic. This book will eradicate previous perceptions since it erases the facade of John Lennon and shows his real soul. While language in certain passages may offend some readers, mature teens should benefit from Lennon's honest evaluation of his self image and his public image.

The Didache is an early handbook of an anonymous Christian community, likely written before some of the New Testament books were written.&nbsp;It spells out a way of life for Jesus-followers that includes instruction on how to treat one another, how to practice the Eucharist, and how to take in wandering prophets. In <i>The Teaching of the Twelve</i>, Jones unpacks the ancient document, and he traces the life of a small house church in Missouri that is trying to live according to its precepts.&nbsp;<p>Readers will find <i>The Teaching of the Twelve</i> inspirational and challenging, and they will discover a unique window into the life of the very earliest followers of Jesus the Christ. A new, contemporary English translation of the Didache is included.</p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tony Jones (M.Div., Ph.D.) is a theologian, professor, and writer. Currently, he serves as theologian-in-residence at Solomon&#39;s Porch in Minneapolis, and teaches in the doctor of ministry program at Fuller Theologian Seminary. Tony has written ten books on Christian ministry, spirituality, prayer, and new church movements.Calling the Didache the most important book you've never heard of, Emergent leader Jones (<i>The New Christians</i>) briefly unpacks the theological and practical lessons to be gleaned from one of early Christianity's most overlooked texts. Less than half the length of the shortest New Testament gospel, the Didache (teaching) informed new Christians about spiritual practices like baptism, prayer, hospitality, fasting, Eucharist, generosity, and basic morality. Dated between 50 and 130 C.E., it is one of the oldest extant Christian texts not found in the New Testament. Jones writes engagingly, explaining the Didache's meaning and importance while also introducing a surprising interlocutor called Trucker Frank, a Missouri truck driver whose house church has based its life together on the Didache. The great and unique value of this book is its vision of how Christians today might put the Didache in practice, rather than as a contribution to early Christian studies; in fact, biblical scholars and historians may raise eyebrows at a few of the book's assumptions, particularly its oversimplifications about Gnosticism. Jones, however, has done a great service by recovering and interpreting this neglected classic for the ancient-future church. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I have a "study" Bible (KJ version) that is great but you have to keep leaving your place to go see if there are footnotes. I still like it but this book you can read much faster with more understanding. The actual scriptures (KJ version) are listed with verse numbers as in the Bible but he interjects commentary (in italics) along the way. For example, as you are reading you come across a word they is common confusing and he will have the meaning in parenthesis and italics. An example is the word sepulchre (tomb)...I can't put it in italics here. He does this for phrases as well. Items of key note are written in bold and he will often have 1 or more paragraphs included to either give you background or clarify a passage. I am liking it so much I bought 2 more of his books. I find that I am spending more time reading the scriptures this way. I highly recommend it. --Amazon<br><br>Love David J. Ridges books. This one is no exception. However, I have found more commentary on some of his other volumes. I do like how he has the scriptures printed and he makes things easier to understand, plus gives back ground for the times and defines words. Shipping was a little slower, but it still got to me before I had to teach class. I ordered vol. 1, 2 and Revelations and ordered the latter 2 at a later time, but they came in before this one.

He stood there for several minutes, waiting for their queries, but none came. When he left, the head of NCAR's computing division chided the programmers. 'Why didn't someone raise a hand?' After a tense moment, one programmer replied, 'How do you talk to God?'" -from The SUPERMEN The Story of Seymour Cray and the Technical Wizards behind the Supercomputer<br> <br> "They were building revolutionary, not evolutionary, machines. . . . They were blazing a trail-molding science into a product. . . . The freedom to create was extraordinary." -from The Supermen<br> <br> In 1951, a soft-spoken, skinny young man fresh from the University of Minnesota took a job in an old glider factory in St. Paul. Computer technology would never be the same, for the glider factory was the home of Engineering Research Associates and the recent college grad was Seymour R. Cray. During his extraordinary career, Cray would be alternately hailed as "the Albert Einstein," "the Thomas Edison," and "the Evel Knievel" of supercomputing. At various times, he was all three-a master craftsman, inventor, and visionary whose disdain for the rigors of corporate life became legendary, and whose achievements remain unsurpassed.<br> <br> The Supermen is award-winning writer Charles J. Murray's exhilarating account of how the brilliant-some would say eccentric-Cray and his gifted colleagues blazed the trail that led to the Information Age. This is a thrilling, real-life scientific adventure, deftly capturing the daring, seat-of-the-pants spirit of the early days of computer development, as well as an audacious, modern-day David and Goliath battle, in which a group of maverick engineers beat out IBM to become the runaway industry leaders.<br> <br> Murray's briskly paced narrative begins during the final months of the Second World War, when men such as William Norris and Howard Engstrom began researching commercial applications for the code-breaking machines of wartime, and charts the rise of technological research in response to the Cold War. In those days computers were huge, cumbersome machines with names like Demon and Atlas. When Cray came on board, things quickly changed.<br> <br> Drawing on in-depth interviews-including the last interview Cray completed before his untimely and tragic death-Murray provides rare insight into Cray's often controversial approach to his work. Cray could spend exhausting hours in single-minded pursuit of a particular goal, and Murray takes us behind the scenes to witness late-night brainstorming sessions and miraculous eleventh-hour fixes. Cray's casual, often hostile attitude toward management, although alienating to some, was more than a passionate need for independence; he simply thought differently than others. Seymour Cray saw farther and faster, and trusted his vision with an unassailable confidence. Yet he inspired great loyalty as well, making it possible for his own start-up company, Cray Research, to bring the 54,000-employee conglomerate of Control Data to its knees.<br> <br> Ultimately, The Supermen is a story of genius, and how a unique set of circumstances-a small-team approach, corporate detachment, and a government-backed marketplace-enabled that genius to flourish. In an atmosphere of unparalleled freedom and creativity, Seymour Cray's vision and drive fueled a technological revolution from which America would emerge as the world's leader in supercomputing.</p><p>The story of supercomputing is only partially about technology. More than anything, it&#39;s about the gifted, brilliant, and often eccentric individuals who knew how to use that technology in new ways to do amazing things. Perhaps the most amazing of the bunch was Seymour Cray, the bureaucracy-intolerant genius with the barnstorming mind whose name has become synonymous with supercomputers. Charles Murray gives us an insightful and often thrilling and sometimes amusing look into how Cray and his genius companions took computers to new heights and humbled companies like Control Data and IBM.The Supermen offers the first up-close-and-personal profile of Seymour Cray, the brilliant and reputedly eccentric designer of the world&#39;s fastest computers. This is the story of a technical genius who, against all odds, created a series of machines that revolutionized the computing industry. Chronicling each major breakthrough, Murray takes us behind the scenes to witness late-night brainstorming sessions, miraculous eleventh-hour fixes, and flashes of insight when bold new ideas were cooked up. Drawing from rare in-depth interviews with Seymour Cray, Murray gives us an unparalleled portrait of the man and his methods, reporting not only Cray&#39;s personal reflections, but the recollections of his closest colleagues and the truth behind the rumors.</p><h2>Healthcare Operations Management, Third Edition (Aupha/Hap Book)</h2><p><strong>Student Resources (click here for access)</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Instructor Resources: </strong> This book's Instructor Resources include PowerPoint slides, an updated test bank, teaching notes for the end-of-chapter exercises, Excel files and cases for selected chapters, and new case studies, for most chapters, with accompanying teaching notes.

Using her signature, accessible writing style, author Kathleen M. Galotti masterfully connects cognitive psychology to students&#x2032; everyday lives through current, relevant examples. The <strong>Sixth Edition </strong>has been updated to reflect the rapidly changing field of cognitive psychology with new references, streamlined content that gives more attention to key topics like memory, and material on advances in research that enhance our understanding of how people acquire and use information.&nbsp;</p></p><p><strong>Kathleen M. Galotti </strong>holds a B.A. in psychology and economics from Wellesley College, as well as an M.A. and a Ph.D. in psychology and an M.S.E. in computer and information sciences from the University of Pennsylvania. At Carleton College she holds the title Professor and Director of Cognitive Science, an interdisciplinary program, which she helped establish in 1989. She also is a former department chair of Psychology. She teaches courses in cognitive and developmental psychology and cognitive science, and has also taught courses in statistics and introductory psychology. Dr. Galotti is the author or coauthor of dozens of peer-reviewed studies in cognitive and developmental psychology. Her research centers on the development of reasoning and decision-making skills from the preschool period through adulthood and on the styles with which adolescents and adults plan for the future, make important life commitments, and learn new information. Her research has been funded through the National Science Foundation, the Spencer Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health.

In the author&#39;s words, &#34;The emergence of legitimate party opposition and of a theory of politics that accepted it was something new in the history of the world; it required a bold new act of understanding on the part of its contemporaries and it still requires study on our part.&#34; Professor Hofstadter&#39;s analysis of the idea of party and the development of legitimate opposition offers fresh insights into the political crisis of 1797-1801, on the thought of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Martin Van Buren, and other leading figures, and on the beginnings of modern democratic politics.</p><p>The late <b>Richard Hofstadter</b> was DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University. He was the author of many books and articles on American History and twice received the Pulitzer Prize: in History in 1956, and in general nonfiction in 1964.</p><h2>Interpersonal Skills for Leadership</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This practical resource provides an introduction to interpersonal skills theories which are reinforced through experiential activities. Coverage focuses on the development of the basic interpersonal skills necessary to become a successful leader. <b> </b> Addresses such topics as: skills in journaling; methods for less stressful and more rewarding lifestyles; active learning; critical-thinking skills; service learning; communicating online; active listening; nonverbal communication; perception; self-concept and self-esteem; time management; and cross-cultural communication. <b> </b> For use as a guide for servant leadership professionals. </p></p><p><p> In the decade since ideas for this book were first developed and earlier editions were published, much has happened, but much has stayed the same. Effective skills in interpersonal communication are still essential for successful leaders. This book is designed as a practical resource providing an introduction to interpersonal skills theories that are reinforced through experiential activities. Previous versions of this book have been field-tested nationally by well over 30 faculty and over 1,500 students. Their feedback has allowed us to refine the text into what we believe to be one of the most practical, useful interpersonal skill texts available. </p> <p> The ability to be in command of one's own life, to relate well to other people, and to lead others in positive directions is a valuable commodity in the exciting and changing time in which we live. Our futures are more than ever bound to those of other people, both the neighbor next door and the business colleague around the world. Likewise, the fear and uncertainty caused by terrorism and war have heightened our awareness of the lack of understanding of each other around the globe. The pace of living is fast, and huge quantities of information are available to us in the blink of an eye (or a tap on the computer keyboard). Electronic devices for communication&#x2014;everything from e-mail and cell phones, to an array of gadgets&#x2014;are having major impacts on our professional and personal lives. Still, the measure of one's success depends, as it always has, on our dealings with the people beside whom we walk on the fast track and whom we engage in information exchange. </p> <p> For all its burgeoning possibility, or perhaps because of it, the world must still deal with incivility, violence, discord, and distress. Even the seemingly minor stresses of daily life&#x2014;a malfunctioning teller machine, traffic jams, long lines at the food market&#x2014;are not easily resolved with superficial solutions. Both leaders and followers can make their lives and the lives of those with whom they live and work less stressful and much richer through the exercise of good personal skills. Time devoted to learning to listen well, to act with commitment and vision, to value yourself and your capabilities, to handle stress and conflict, to communicate with trust and empathy, to lead wisely, and to truly value others is indeed time well spent. </p> <p> For these reasons, we offer this book as a guide to developing interpersonal skills that will serve you well in all aspects of your life-on campus, at home, in the community, and in the workplace. </p> <p> We acknowledge colleagues across the country who provided invaluable scholarly contributions to this text and extend to them our sincerest thanks. </p> <p> We also welcome you to these pages, in which we hope you find a true reflection of yourself. Practice what you find here in whatever ways best suit your needs; we wish you every success as you test your leadership wings. May you fly high and happily. </p> <p> We encourage you to use this text as a workbook, selecting and augmenting to fit the particular needs of teachers and students in leadership education. We hope this book meets your needs and we welcome your feedback. </p></p><h2>Legal Nurse Consulting Principles and Practices</h2><p><p><em>Legal Nurse Consulting Principles and Practices</em>, Fourth Edition, provides foundational knowledge on the specialty nursing practice of legal nurse consulting.

Political polarization and the election in 2016 of an &#x201c;outsider&#x201d; president intent on disrupting conventional governance norms have generated a seemingly unprecedented volume of new legal controversies.This updated edition addresses both separation of powers questions of long standing and many of the hot issues arising in the later Obama years and the early months of the Trump Administration. The authors have wholly revised the text&#x2019;s exploration of the President&#x2019;s &#x201c;faithful execution of the laws&#x201d; obligations, significantly expanded the material on presidential authority regarding immigration, and updated the material on presidential regulatory oversight to take account of the latest developments. For the first time in this text, litigation over the Foreign Emoluments Clause makes an appearance. The materials on war powers have been reorganized into two chapters, highlighting how post-9/11 developments have challenged the categorical distinctions between war and peace, battlefield and home front, and domestic and international affairs around which &#x201c;war powers law&#x201d; has traditionally been oriented.The book retains its clear structure and historical perspective, along with the authors&#x2019; emphasis on the ethical challenges posed for lawyers in the executive and legislative branches who seek to address novel separation of powers issues in professionally appropriate ways.</p><p>Peter Shane is the Jacob E.

At a time when white elites were concerned with imperialist projects and civilizing missions, progressive white women developed an explicit racial ideology to promote their cause, defending patriarchy for "primitives" while calling for its elimination among the "civilized." By exploring how progressive white women at the turn of the century laid the intellectual groundwork for the feminist social movements that followed, Louise Michele Newman speaks directly to contemporary debates about the effect of race on current feminist scholarship.<br><br>"<em>White Women's Rights</em> is an important book. It is a fascinating and informative account of the numerous and complex ties which bound feminist thought to the practices and ideas which shaped and gave meaning to America as a racialized society. A compelling read, it moves very gracefully between the general history of the feminist movement and the particular histories of individual women."--Hazel Carby, Yale University<br></p><p><br><strong>Louise Michele Newman</strong> is Assistant Professor of History at the University of Florida.<br><br>"This is a provocative and important book that makes a major contribution to our understanding of how American feminism has been shaped by a legacy of racism. In a compelling and illuminating exploration of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century feminist thought, Newman explores how racial thinking distorted liberal ideals of citizenship and democracy and limited the commitments of white women to equality for all. Everyone interested in the deep-rooted and paradoxical consequences of hidden racism should read this book."--Alice Kessler-Harris, Rutgers University<p></p><br>"Newman's book will be as much admired as it is hotly debated. The book is, if anything, more broadly significant than it looks at first encounter. <em>White Women's Rights</em> is acute in its demonstration that important breaks in feminist (and anthropological) thought have often developed unevenly and contradictorily, shuffling elements of existing evolutionary models rather than overthrowing them. The tone of Newman's work is exemplary, evoking tragedies without lapsing into easy moralism."--David Roediger, University of Minnesota<p></p><br>"<em>White Women's Rights</em> is an important book.

He was unlearned and came from a humble background. While looking at a barren tree one wintry day, the eighteen&#x2013;year&#x2013;old Lawrence realized that this tree would blossom once again. He was profoundly moved by God's providence and overcome with love for God. He was not only converted that day but also forever committed to serving God wholeheartedly.

Now, with a more introspective focus, this new collection emphasizes the personal as "a way of seeing the world, of expressing an interior life. It is intimate without being maudlin, it is private without being secret." From Harriet Doerr's recollection of a halcyon time to Josephine Jacobsen's reverie on memory, <em>In Brief</em> offers vivid glimpses into the ways experience can be shaped in language that is fresh and inventive. The seventy-two authors here include the known &#x2015; John McPhee, Cythia Ozick, James Salter &#x2015; as well as remarkable new writers. Essays (all under 2000 words) range from Frank McCourt's search for his father in the pubs of Limerick to William Maxwell's thoughts about growing old; from Charles Baxter's early experience of reading to Brady Udall's confession as a liar. Patricia Hampl recalls meals at her grandmother's house, while Jane Brox contemplates the meaning of bread. In each piece, imagination becomes a way to explore reality. The real world we are fortunate enough to live in is revealed as endlessly rich and deep.</p><p><p><strong>Mary Paumier Jones</strong> lives in Rochester. &nbsp;Jones, who teaches creative nonfiction, has a degree in library science.</p><p>Writer and educator <strong>Judith Kitchen</strong> (1941&#x2013;2014) was the cofounder of the Rainier Writing Workshop at Pacific Lutheran University.</p>An anthology of sleek, mostly savvy, short bits of creative nonfiction that focus on the theme of the personal. One might justifiably feel that the trend toward such micro essays panders to attention spans that have been eclipsed by television and the endless barrage of advertisements and sound-bytes which we now experience as normal. But, then again, there is something so delicious about a quick literary nugget that you can gulp down in those five or six minutes of transitional time between ``getting things done,'' which so often serves as our free time these days. The best of these shorts (there are 72 in the collection) represent the compression of a wide range of human emotion and experience into a single objecta sort of self-reflexive literary fetishization. N. Scott Momaday's ``The Indian Dog,'' for example, accesses fierceness of spirit and human longing with the description of a five-dollar dog that refuses to stay with his new master. Ariel Dorfman manages to evoke the multitude of complex emotions experienced by Argentinean refugees sheltering in their embassy during the military takeover in Chile with the image of a blanket thrown over the wall by an unseen person who is shot before he or she can climb to safety. David Shields condenses desire into the longing for a boy-scout belt; Kelly Simon resolves an encounter with fame by chewing a piece of gum left behind by Frank Sinatra. The new style of this short prose writing is perhaps best reflected by the degree to which pieces such as the chapter from Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes (in which he searches the pubs of Limerick for his drunken father), seem out of place. McCourt's conversational, narrative style seems to cheat the spirit of mosaic which characterizes many of the shorter shorts. Shorts are coming into their own as a literary genre resistance is futile! -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

At the time, these groups were part of a disorganized counterculture that felt far from the mainstream.<br><br>But since then, all that has changed. Racially-motivated violence has been on open display at rallies in Charlottesville, Berkeley, Pikesville, Phoenix, and Boston. Membership in white nationalist organizations is rising, and national politicians, including the president, are validating their perceived grievances.<br><br><i>Everything You Love Will Burn</i> offers a terrifying, sobering inside look at these newly empowered movements, from their conventions to backroom meetings with Republican operatives. Tenold introduces us to neo-Nazis in Brooklyn; a millennial Klanswoman in Tennessee; and a rising star in the movement, nicknamed the "Little Fï¿½hrer" by the Southern Poverty Law Center, who understands political power and is organizing a grand coalition of far-right groups to bring them into the mainstream.<br><br><i>Everything You Love Will Burn </i>takes readers to the dark, paranoid underbelly of America, a world in which the white race is under threat and the enemy is everywhere.<br></p><p><b>Vegas Tenold</b> is an award-winning journalist.

It's meant hanging with neo-Nazis, skinheads, Hammerskins and Klansmen-at his own peril. It's meant attending fiery cross-burnings and white-members only caucuses at roadside motels or backyard barbecues.

Of modest size, a little less than three feet high, it is one of the oldest surviving panel pictures to be painted in oils rather than tempera. It is also regarded as the first work of art which simultaneously celebrates both middle-class comfort and monogamous marriage. Not surprisingly, very little is known for certain about who the sitters are. The common assumption is that it is a portrait commemorating the wedding of Giovanni Arnolfini, an Italian merchant, and his probably pregnant wife, who are seen at their home in Bruges. Is it a picture of the marriage ceremony, with the painter as a witness barely discernible in the mirror on the wall in the centre - or a celebration of their union?

Our lives are increasingly insular. We are in a hurry, our heads are down, minds elsewhere, we hear only the voices we already recognize and rarely take the effort to experience something or someone new. Talking to strangers pulls you into experiences of shared humanity and creates genuine emotional connections. It opens your world.

She writes, teaches, and speaks around the world about stranger interactions, independent learning, and relational technology.When Strangers Meet 1<p></p> Who Is a Stranger?<p></p> <br>How do you divide the world into known and unknown? Stranger is a slippery word&#x2014;you think you know what it means until you try to account for yourself. It names an idea that invisibly structures your everyday life, what you see, the choices you make, the way you move. Are you ready to see just how slippery it is? Tell me what you mean when you say stranger.<br> <br>I ask this a lot, and almost everything I hear boils down to this wonderfully contradictory list.<br> <br>ï¿½ Someone you&#x2019;ve only seen once.<br> <br>ï¿½ The entire world of people you&#x2019;ve never met or encountered.<br> <br>ï¿½ All the people who are unknown to you but possibly knowable, the people who you&#x2019;re aware of as individuals in some way, but have never met or encountered in person.<br> <br>ï¿½ People you have personal information about but have not met, like a friend of a friend, or a public person.<br> <br>ï¿½ A person who doesn&#x2019;t share your context, whether that is ideological or geographical.<br> <br>ï¿½ A person you don&#x2019;t have anything in common with.<br> <br>ï¿½ Someone who is not part of any group you define yourself as belonging to.<br> <br>ï¿½ Someone you can&#x2019;t understand.<br> <br>ï¿½ Someone who is a threat.<br> <br>ï¿½ Someone you encounter frequently but don&#x2019;t know anything about other than what you can observe.<br> <br>ï¿½ Someone whose name you don&#x2019;t know.<br> <br>When we examine our ideas about strangers, the notion that a stranger is someone to be afraid of often falls away, chalked up to childhood training in &#x201c;stranger danger&#x201d; or something gleaned from the media, in contradiction to our lived experiences. Who we think is a stranger is an individual thing. It&#x2019;s also defined by culture and history. The ways we interact with strangers&#x2014;and so our very ideas of whom they are&#x2014;can change in response to major events. During major disruptions in our lives, in storms, floods, outages, transit strikes, we suspend our usual expectations and put feelings of community above fear. Ever more frequent terrorist attacks by Islamic fundamentalists around the world have directly increased suspicion of strangers&#x2014;and have fueled illogical and unwarranted assumptions about what kind of stranger poses a threat.<br> <br>Our concepts of strangers and how we behave toward them also vary by situation. Is it dark, am I alone, am I in familiar territory, am I lost, am I in the minority in this place?<br> <br>Who counts as a stranger? Who do we greet? Who do we avoid? My four-year-old daughter forces me to ask these questions constantly. My family lives in a city, in an area with residential blocks and commercial streets crossing each other. As my daughter and I walk around the neighborhood, I watch her sort strangers.<br> <br>I say hello to most people, and she wants to know why. Are they our friend? she&#x2019;ll ask. &#x201c;No, just a neighbor&#x201d; might be the answer when it&#x2019;s someone we see often or people who are walking near our house. Do we know them? &#x201c;No, we&#x2019;ve never met them.&#x201d; Why did you say hi then? &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just nice to be friendly.&#x201d; I think twice when I tell her that, even though I mean it. And as a woman, I know very well that strangers on the street don&#x2019;t always have such noble intentions. It is good to be friendly, and it&#x2019;s good to learn when not to be. But none of that means we have to be afraid.<br> <br>Our apartment is near a halfway house, and some of the people who live there are hard cases, apparently a little &#x201c;off&#x201d; in one way or another. They might be dressed in very shabby or unwashed clothes, or behaving in ways that look like they&#x2019;re high on something. Their speech or body language sometimes puts me on alert for behavior that may or may not be harmless. I feel varying degrees of discomfort about any of these situations, and I want my daughter to see that I make choices&#x2014;and learn to make her own&#x2014;about who I greet and how I avoid interacting with someone I think might be unpredictable or unpleasant. I want her to understand an essential distinction in a world of strangers: unpredictable and unpleasant are not by definition dangerous.<br> <br>On our way to school one morning there was a man in the middle of the block we usually walk down, and he was yelling angrily at the air, stomping his feet and swinging his arms. I said to my daughter, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go another way.&#x201d; She asked, Why can&#x2019;t we go that way, isn&#x2019;t he our neighbor? Once a question is asked, it snakes through many others. I had to wonder what made me uneasy and whether or not it was based on good instincts or prejudice I&#x2019;m blind to. That day, I said, &#x201c;Well, that man looks pretty upset and I don&#x2019;t want to get too close to him.&#x201d; Why is he upset? she asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s bothering him, but I can tell by the way he&#x2019;s yelling and what he&#x2019;s doing with his body that I don&#x2019;t want to get near him right now.&#x201d; I watched her taking that in. I had sidestepped the shorthand of saying, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s acting crazy,&#x201d; though that&#x2019;s what I would have said to an adult. I wasn&#x2019;t being delicate about my choice of language as much as I was avoiding a cascade of questions I wasn&#x2019;t prepared to answer there on that street corner. What&#x2019;s crazy? How did he get that way? Is he always crazy? How do I know someone is crazy?<br> <br>What was important to me in that moment was that she learn to perceive, not learn to name or categorize.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s an uphill battle, because categorizing is something human brains do. We categorize people as a shortcut to learning about them. We see young, old, white, black, male, female, stranger, friend, and we use the information we store in that box, the box labeled OLD or FEMALE or STRANGER to define them. Sometimes that&#x2019;s the best we can do, but it creates a dreadful lack of knowing at the individual level.<br> <br>Categorization and its malignant offspring, stereotyping, are learned at home, in school, on the street. These ways we have of seeing each other also have deep roots in human history. The blunt argument made by some academics (and further oversimplified by the media) says we became hardwired for this in an early moment in human evolution, when having a strong sense of &#x201c;us and them&#x201d; helped humans in an extremely resource-poor environment choose who to help and who to exclude so that their group had a better shot at survival. In other words, fear and bias were once useful. It may be in one way or another true that we were once dependent on keeping our groups closed. But turn your most suspicious eye on theories that say humans are hardwired for anything. Someone may be using an idea as a sledgehammer. That word is trying to tell you there&#x2019;s something we can&#x2019;t change. The fact that &#x201c;us and them&#x201d; thinking has long roots in human history does not mean that it is natural, or acceptable. It does not mean bias is inevitable and immutable, or that fearful and defensive instincts should continue to drive us.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no question: We have to choose whom to trust. The world is full of dangers, and a few of them arrive in the form of an unfamiliar face. We have to navigate that world safely somehow. We can make these choices with attention and grace. If we don&#x2019;t, we will find ourselves in a one-dimensional world, deprived of honest human connections and interruptions that awaken us.<br> <br>None of this is easy. To learn to truly see someone you&#x2019;ve never met is hard. Slotting them into categories is a lazy shortcut we rely on too often. Relying on your perceptions&#x2014;giving careful attention to what your senses are telling you without jumping to conclusions&#x2014;costs time and effort. It&#x2019;s not a lightning reflex but a skill to be learned. You can practice it in places with low stakes. Take a walk in the park, in daylight, and look at the people around you. What do you see? What puts you at ease or sets you on edge? Who counts as a stranger?<br> <br>Whatever you find, and wherever you think it comes from, one thing is certain: we are surrounded by individuals, not categories. There are adventures to be had here, adventures you can set out for every day of your life. To really understand how you divide the world, to use your senses to choose whom to make familiar, and to stop and say hello to a stranger, these bold acts can transform your emotional experience of the public world. And you can transform the public world itself right along with you.</p><h2>The Drop Edge of Yonder</h2><p><i>The Drop Edge of Yonder</i> is an adventurous book that explores the truth and temptations of the American myth.<br><br>Beginning in the savage wilds of Colorado in the waning days of the fur trade, the story follows Zebulon Shook, a mountain man who has had a curse placed on him by a mysterious Native American woman whose lover he murdered. The book follows Zebulon as he encounters people obsessed with greed and the politics of expansion. The trail takes him from Colorado to the remote reaches of the Northwest, a journey that traverses the Gulf of Mexico to Panama, and up the coast of California to San Francisco and the gold fields.<br><br>Far from being simply a western,&#x201d; <i>The Drop Edge of Yonder</i> focuses on a time that could be considered the starting point of American capitalism and expansionism, and has led Judith Thurman to refer to the book as a subversive modern novel about the bounds of love and the discontents of civilized life.&#x201d;<br><br><i>The Drop Edge of Yonder</i> originated as a screenplay treatment that intrigued Hollywood folk such as Sam Peckinpah, Hal Ashby, Yves Simeneau, Jim Jarmusch, Roger Spotiswoode, Alex Cox, and Richard Gere, before being adapted and expanded into this original novel by Wurlitzer.<br></p><p><b>Rudolph Wurlitzer</b> is the author of <i>Nog</i>, <i>Flats</i>, <i>Quake</i>, and <i>Slow Fade, and a non-fiction book, <i>Hard Travel to Sacred Places</i>.

Known for 1969's <i>Nog</i> and the 1973 script for <i>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</i>, Wurlitzer delivers a mystic western possessed of anarchic charms and incantatory beauty. Mountain-man, trapper and opportunistic beast Zebulon Shook starts the tale by getting cursed by a half-Shoshoni half-Irish woman. Doomed never to know whether he is in the spirit world, the real world or just dreaming, he departs from his homestead along the Gila River in New Mexico to sell pelts. After meeting up with his adopted brother, Hatchet Jack, and losing at cards to Delilah, a beautiful Abyssinian courtesan, Zebulon is shot during a barroom dustup and sets out for California, where the gold rush is gathering steam, bringing with it the law and order that threatens the mountain doin's that he loves so dearly. Zebulon is pulled ever deeper into the era's bizarre historical footnotes: immortalized as a notorious outlaw by a reporter; narrowly missing joining the Walker expedition to colonize Nicaragua; reconnecting with Delilah at a San Francisco opium den; and finding the law and order forces dogging his heels to the last.

I was raised as a girl but discovered at a young age that my body looked different. Having endured an often turbulent home life as a kid, there were many times when I felt scared and alone, especially given my attraction to girls. But unlike most people in the first world who are born intersex--meaning they have genitals, reproductive organs, hormones, and/or chromosomal patterns that do not fit standard definitions of male or female--I grew up in the body I was born with because my parents did not have my sex characteristics surgically altered at birth.<br><br> It wasn't until I was twenty-six and encountered the term <i>intersex </i>in a San Francisco newspaper that I finally had a name for my difference. That's when I began to explore what it means to live in the space between genders--to be both and neither. I tried living as a feminine woman, an androgynous person, and even for a brief period of time as a man. Good friends would not recognize me, and gay men would hit on me. My gender fluidity was exciting, and in many ways freeing--but it could also be isolating.<br><br> I had to know if there were other intersex people like me, but when I finally found an intersex community to connect with I was shocked, and then deeply upset, to learn that most of the people I met had been scarred, both physically and psychologically, by infant surgeries and hormone treatments meant to "correct" their bodies. Realizing that the invisibility of intersex people in society facilitated these practices, I made it my mission to bring an end to it--and became one of the first people to voluntarily come out as intersex at a national and then international level.<br><br> <i>Born Both </i>is the story of my lifelong journey toward finding love and embracing my authentic identity in a world that insists on categorizing people into either/or, and of my decades-long fight for human rights and equality for intersex people everywhere.</p><p><strong>Hida Viloria </strong>is a writer and intersex activist, chairperson of the Organization Intersex International (OII), and founding director of its American affiliate the Intersex Campaign for Equality, also known as OII-USA.

Above all, they seek the guidance of Perla Portillo, the shop&#x2019;s owner. Perla has served the community for years, arming her clients with the tools to overcome all manner of crises, large and small. There is Juan, a man coming to terms with the death of his father; Nancy, a recently married schoolteacher; Shawn, an addict looking for peace in his chaotic life; and Rosa, a teenager trying to lose weight and find herself. But when a customer with a troubled and mysterious past arrives, Perla struggles to help and must confront both her unfulfilled hopes and doubts about her place in a rapidly changing world.<br><br>Imaginative, inspiring, lyrical, and beautifully written, <i>Still Water Saints</i> evokes the unpredictability of life and the resilience of the spirit through the journeys of the people of Agua Mansa, and especially of the one woman at the center of it all. Theirs are stories of faith and betrayal, love and loss, the bonds of family and community, and the constancy of change.</p><p>Alex Espinoza was born in Tijuana, Mexico, the youngest of eleven children. At the age of two, he migrated to southern California with his family and grew up in the city of La Puente, a suburb of Los Angeles. Earning a B.A. from the University of California at Riverside with honors, Espinoza went on to receive an MFA from UC Irvine, where he was the editor of the university&#x2019;s literary magazine. He now teaches creative writing at UC Riverside. <i>Still Water Saints</i> is his first novel.Chapter 1 <br>She could walk on water.<br><br>She roamed the banks of the Santa Ana, among the long green stalks, chanting to the moon, to the gods of Night and Shadow. She rose and stepped onto the river, her footsteps gently rippling the surface.<br><br>She summoned the spirits of the dead. They whispered their secrets to her, and she scribbled their messages on scraps of paper and in the margins of her phone book:<br><br>Tell Ramï¿½n the locket fell on the floor between the bed and the nightstand.<br><br>I&#x2019;m all right. It&#x2019;s like Disneyland up here, only without rides.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t miss my ears because they were too big.<br><br>She fought the Devil. Every night he came to her, his head crowned with horns, his skin covered in scales. He cursed and called her names. She beat him back with her bare hands and sent him running, his cloven feet tapping against the tile of her kitchen floor.<br><br>She was a Bruja. A Santa. A Divina. A Medium, Prophet, and Healer. Able to pass through walls and read minds, to pull tumors from ailing bodies, to uncross hexes and spells, to raise the dead, and to stop time. When doctors failed, when priests and praying were not enough, the people of Agua Mansa came to the Botï¿½nica Oshï¿½n, to Perla. The shop sold amulets and stones, rosaries and candles. They bought charms to change their luck, teas to ease unsettled nerves, and estampas of saints, the worn plastic cards they carried in their purses or wallets for protection.<br><br>As thanks the customers brought her booklets of coupons and long strips of lottery tickets. They gave her fresh bouquets of roses and carnations. They showed her pictures of aunts and uncles she had helped see through heart surgeries and hip replacements. They brought in the children she had saved from drug addictions and prison sentences. They told her of the abusive husbands and gambling wives she had chased away for good. Men often grew uneasy in her presence. The women always opened up.<br><br>&#x201c;I think I have bilis,&#x201d; Gilda Mejï¿½a said, walking up to the register where Perla stood. &#x201c;Look.&#x201d; She stuck out her tongue. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all yellow. Plus my stomach&#x2019;s upset.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where do I start?&#x201d; Gilda rested her hands on the glass countertop. She rented an apartment over at the Agua Mansa Palms. Her brother and his new wife had moved in a few weeks ago, after he lost his job. The couple was making it hard for Gilda to relax when she came home from work because they were always in the living room watching television with the volume turned all the way up.<br><br>&#x201c;You think they&#x2019;d turn it down, but no. They&#x2019;re not deaf. And his wife. I can&#x2019;t stand her. The way she talks to my brother. And she&#x2019;s cheating on him. I see the way she looks at that guy from 312. There&#x2019;s something going on there.&#x201d; It was too crowded for three people in a one-bedroom apartment, she explained. Her brother and his wife fought well into the night, making it hard for her to sleep. She was irritable all the time, and her nerves felt ready to snap at any moment.<br><br>Simonillo was perfect to cure strong cases of bilis, to relieve tension and stress. Perla stepped away from the register and walked over to the packets of herbs that hung from pegs on the left wall of the botï¿½nica.<br><br>&#x201c;I want you to make a tea with this,&#x201d; she said, handing the bag to Gilda. &#x201c;Drink it on an empty stomach. It&#x2019;s bitter, so suck on a sugar cube or put some honey in it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Gilda said, handing over money for the herbs. &#x201c;I just want to be better.&#x201d;<br><br>Perla took a blue seven-day candle from the shelves behind the register. She pointed to the picture of Our Lady of Regla on the glass candleholder. The Virgin, holding the infant Jesus, floated on a bed of clouds high above a cathedral. &#x201c;Light this veladora before going to bed. Keep it lit all night while you sleep.&#x201d;<br><br>After Gilda left, Miriam Orozco&#x2019;s van pulled up. She got out, but her husband stayed in the car.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Miriam. How can I help you?&#x201d; Perla said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not me this time.&#x201d; She pointed to the van. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s him. He&#x2019;s embarrassed to talk to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Embarrassed? Why embarrassed?&#x201d;<br><br>Miriam shrugged her shoulders. &#x201c;Men. You know how they&#x2019;re like. Big babies.&#x201d;<br><br>Perla walked out into the parking lot. The car door was locked. &#x201c;Talk to me, Jorge,&#x201d; she shouted and knocked on the window.<br><br>He rolled it down. &#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; he said, resting his elbow on the door.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you embarrassed about? Miriam says you don&#x2019;t want to come in.&#x201d;<br><br>Miriam stood behind Perla, jiggling the car&#x2019;s keys. &#x201c;Tell her. Don&#x2019;t act dumb.&#x201d; She crossed her arms and sighed.<br><br>But Jorge stayed quiet.<br><br>Miriam said, &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s what happened: Jorge went to a doctor who said he has depression. The pills the doctor gave him made his mouth dry. Jorge, tell her! You&#x2019;ve missed work.&#x201d; Miriam walked over and leaned against the van&#x2019;s hood, watching Jorge through the windshield spotted with mud. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t touch me anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The doctor,&#x201d; Jorge said, raking his hair with his fingers. &#x201c;He says I&#x2019;m going through a midlife crisis. Menopause for men. Is that for real? I cry a lot. I&#x2019;m no fun to be around. I can&#x2019;t look at my wife in that way. When we&#x2019;re in bed. Together. You know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come with me,&#x201d; Perla told Miriam. Back inside the botï¿½nica, Perla asked her, &#x201c;Has he been eating anything strange?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>The oils, bath salts, and scents were kept on the shelves next to the herbs and teas. Perla picked up a bottle of &#x201c;Love Musk&#x201d; cologne. &#x201c;Has he been drinking?&#x201d; She took a prayer card of Saint Job from the plastic rack on the counter.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Miriam said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been sober now for fifteen years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m only making sure. Have you been putting a lot of pressure on him? To do things? Around the house? Are you fighting over money?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Everything&#x2019;s good. Except for this.&#x201d;<br><br>They walked back out to the van together, and Miriam got in. Perla handed the bag to Jorge and said, &#x201c;This is a cologne I want you to wear. It&#x2019;ll help you with your love problem. There&#x2019;s an estampa. Job.&#x201d; She showed him the picture on the card. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the patron of depressed people. Pray one Rosary to him. And I want you to keep taking those pills the doctor gave you. Even if they make your mouth dry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s bad at following directions,&#x201d; Miriam said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make sure he does, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Perla said. &#x201c;If he&#x2019;s not better, have him go see the doctor again. If still nothing, bring him back here.&#x201d;<br><br>Miriam started the car, took the rosary wrapped around the rearview mirror, and handed it to Jorge. &#x201c;Hold this,&#x201d; she said as they pulled away.<br><br>Perla helped a man whose daughter was fighting hard to kick a drug habit. Someone else needed luck in starting up a new restaurant. An old woman Perla recognized but whose name escaped her memory brought in her grandson because the boy was wetting his bed.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s thirteen,&#x201d; the old woman said. &#x201c;Too old to be peeing in bed. I think he needs a limpia.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t wanna do this,&#x201d; the boy protested. He crossed his arms and glared at Perla. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s stupid.&#x201d;<br><br>The old woman tugged at his shirt. &#x201c;Stop it, Tony.&#x201d;<br><br>Perla took the sign that read BACK IN A FEW MINUTES and taped it to the door. She led the boy and his grandmother behind the counter and through the curtain that separated the front of the store from the back.<br><br>The small kitchenette, with the mini-refrigerator and microwave Darï¿½o had given Perla when he left her the store, occupied much of the cramped stockroom. The rest of the space housed three bookshelves about six feet tall on which Perla kept her back stock. The narrow hallway separating the kitchenette and shelves from the bathroom and utility closet was where she held private consultations.<br><br>Perla worked slowly to gather the items, trying to remember what Darï¿½o had taught her. &#x201c;Limpias are delicate because you&#x2019;re cleansing a body and chasing away evil spirits,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s important to concentrate.&#x201d; He had used a cigar, feathers, and an egg. He had chanted and whispered, rocking back and forth on his heels.<br><br>She covered the floor with a sheet and stood the boy in the middle. She coughed when she took a puff from the cigar, then blew the smoke around his body, letting it drift and settle around his head. After beating the air around him with a gray plume she pulled from her feather duster, Perla told Tony to close his eyes. She took an egg from the refrigerator and rubbed it over his body and face.<br><br>&#x201c;This is lame, Grandma,&#x201d; the boy said, then opened his eyes. &#x201c;Can we go?&#x201d;<br><br>Perla turned to the boy&#x2019;s grandmother. &#x201c;There.&#x201d;<br><br>The old woman pointed to the egg. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you supposed to break it and look inside?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Perla said. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She cracked the egg and poured it into a Styrofoam cup.<br><br>&#x201c;Tony,&#x201d; said the boy&#x2019;s grandmother, pointing. &#x201c;See that red swirl? Inside the yolk? That&#x2019;s what was doing it. That there.&#x201d;<br><br>The boy looked. &#x201c;Yeah, right.&#x201d;<br><br>His grandmother pinched Tony&#x2019;s arm, leaving two red marks on his skin. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see what you say when it starts working.&#x201d;<br><br>Perla covered the cup with plastic wrap she kept on the shelf above the kitchenette&#x2019;s sink. &#x201c;Throw this out before you get home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Tony said.<br><br>&#x201c;Because if we don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; the old woman said, &#x201c;the spirits will stay with you. So we have to get rid of it to lose them. Right?&#x201d; She looked at Perla.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So we&#x2019;re just gonna, like, throw that egg out the window of a moving car?&#x201d; Tony asked. &#x201c;What if it hits somebody?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would you rather we not? Would you rather the spirits follow us? Keep making you pee in bed? All your friends will find out and make fun of you, Tony. And that girl you like. You want her to know?&#x201d;<br><br>The boy blushed. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right then,&#x201d; the old woman said. She took some money from her purse and handed it to Perla.<br><br>Perla walked them outside and found a group of customers waiting for her in the parking lot. She sold a &#x201c;Quit Gossiping&#x201d; candle to a high school girl and a jar of &#x201c;Adam and Eve&#x201d; love oil to a man who rode up on a ten-speed bike. Then Rosa Cabrera came in with her four-year-old daughter, Danielle. Rosa was one of Perla&#x2019;s favorite customers. She had been in high school when her mother had first brought her to the store. Now, she was in her late twenties, married, and taking classes to become a hair stylist.<br><br>Danielle&#x2019;s hair was pulled back in two pigtails that glistened wet. She wore faded denim overalls and a red-and-yellow-checkered undershirt. She held out three wild clovers to Perla.<br><br>&#x201c;We came from the park,&#x201d; Rosa said. &#x201c;When I told her we were coming to visit you, she picked them.&#x201d;<br><br>Perla stepped around the counter and bent down to hug Danielle. She took the clovers and gave her a kiss on the cheek. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re pretty,&#x201d; Perla said. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>She put them in a mug and set them next to the statue of Santa Bï¿½rbara to the right of the front door. The statue stood on a square pedestal, holding a gold scepter in one hand, a chalice in the other. Long curls of her brown hair rested in folds on her shoulders. Perla turned to Danielle and pointed at the saint. &#x201c;I think she&#x2019;ll like them, too, no?&#x201d;<br><br>The girl smiled and pressed her face against her mother&#x2019;s thigh.<br><br>&#x201c;I need something to keep me calm. To help me focus. I have a big test coming up.&#x201d; Rosa pointed to the incense sticks by the herbs and teas. &#x201c;Can I get cinnamon?&#x201d;<br><br>Perla took the pack, then walked over to the register to ring her up. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s school?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good. Just a lot of things to memorize, you know?&#x201d; She sighed, unzipping her purse. &#x201c;Who knew studying cosmetology would be so hard?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s worth it, though.&#x201d; Perla put the incense in a paper bag and handed it to Rosa. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hope so.&#x201d; She took Danielle&#x2019;s hand, and they turned toward the door. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll come by your house tomorrow. After my test. I&#x2019;ll let you know how it went.&#x201d;<br><br>Hayley Garrett burst through the door, nearly knocking Rosa and Danielle down.<br><br>&#x201c;Envy,&#x201d; Hayley said, tucking back strands of blond hair and shoving her keys in her back pocket. &#x201c;Someone has that envy thing for me. What you told this one man last time I was in here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Invidia?&#x201d; Perla asked. &#x201c;The Evil Eye?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I mean. I was in the bathroom at work, in one of the stalls. I overheard this girl, Iris Camacho, tell someone else she hated skinny white girls. She said my name. She said &#x2018;I want &#x2019;em all to go away. They&#x2019;re so stupid.&#x2019; Something like that. I didn&#x2019;t catch the rest because somebody flushed.&#x201d;<br><br>Perla thought a moment. &#x201c;How have you been feeling? Tired? Anxious?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I always feel that way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Has your period come on time?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; The girl smirked.<br><br>&#x201c;Stomach feeling okay? No heartburn?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Hayley said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been too freaked out to eat. Working two jobs is a lot. I lost ten pounds. Everything fits me baggy.&#x201d; She laughed. &#x201c;This Evil Eye, isn&#x2019;t it like a curse? Maybe she cursed me, and that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m not eating. That possible?&#x201d;<br><br>Perla said, &#x201c;Well, yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. I think that&#x2019;s what she did. She cursed me.&#x201d; Hayley paused, then laughed again. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s a blessing. I&#x2019;m starting to look good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Losing weight quickly like that could do bad things to your body and your system.&#x201d;<br><br>Hayley touched her stomach. &#x201c;Well, I guess it&#x2019;s not worth it then. All right, all right. What do I do?&#x201d;<br><br>The white wood chips of the cuasia rattled inside the plastic bag when Perla reached for it on the peg and handed it to Hayley. Cuasia, Perla explained, worked to strengthen the body and restore balance.<br><br>&#x201c;I want you to soak these wood chips,&#x201d; Perla said. &#x201c;Use one teaspoon of the chips for each cup of cold water. Steep this for twelve hours, then strain it. Drink one cup in the morning on an empty stomach and a second cup at night. Understand?&#x201d;<br><br>The girl nodded.<br><br>Perla also sold her a bottle of &#x201c;Repel Evil&#x201d; bath salts and a &#x201c;Hex Removing&#x201d; veladora. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Bathe with the &#x2018;Repel Evil&#x2019; salts in the morning before work. It&#x2019;ll protect you from the girl&#x2019;s invidia. Light the candle at night when you&#x2019;re alone.&#x201d;<br><br>Hayley ran her finger across the pictures on the front of the candle.<br><br>&#x201c;Horseshoes,&#x201d; Perla said. &#x201c;Rabbit&#x2019;s feet. Crosses. Lucky symbols. Positivity.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hope this works,&#x201d; Hayley said. &#x201c;Even though I might gain back all that weight I lost.&#x201d;<br><br>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½<br><br>It was time to close. Perla began where she always did, dusting the figure of San Antonio, who stood guard on the wooden table by the front window. She took a bottle of ammonia and, using a crumpled-up sheet of newspaper, wiped down the window&#x2019;s glass. She straightened the statues displayed on the right-hand wall and made sure they all faced forward. She organized the shelves of soaps and oils, bath salts, and incense sticks. Some of the pegs on the wall were empty, so she grabbed some herbs from the back to fill in the gaps. She rearranged the gems and crystals, the books and decks of Tarot cards, the amulets and pendants, the rosaries and crucifixes inside the glass case where the register sat. She took inventory in her binder&#x2014; noting which candles were low, what packets of incense sticks had sold, what herbs and teas she was missing&#x2014;and set the list next to the phone. I&#x2019;ll place an order first thing tomorrow morning.</p><h2>Eyeshield 21, Volume 10</h2><p>The Devil Bats are training harder than ever as they endure a grueling &#34;death march&#34; from Houston to Las Vegas!

Bean&#x2014;derived somehow from Elizabeth&#x2014;was seven, a careful, grave second-grader who wrote her numbers and her name with exaggerated precision and had filled out her Christmas list from the Sears catalogue as if it were a college application.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beth rolled gently, hoping not to awaken Jack next to her, and turned to face the child in the darkness. Her daughter was very close, and Beth could smell her, warm and fresh like a loaf hot from the oven.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, honey?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mommy, it&#x2019;s snowing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know. They said it would on the TV.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The world is all white. Jesus loves the world, he made it all white.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he does, honey,&#x201d; said Beth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack snorted in his sleep, came from unconsciousness with a loggy lurch, half rose, then whispered gruffly, &#x201c;Shhhhhh, girls.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He fell back, inert in seconds.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mommy, can I get in?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course, honey,&#x201d; said Beth, scooting over and lifting the covers so that there was room for Bean, who climbed in and snuggled against her mother. The child was still in a second. Beth could feel her daughter&#x2019;s heart pumping and the rise and fall of her fragile chest. Her little nose was full; she breathed with a vaguely ragged sound, and Beth worried that it would bother Jack, but behind her he continued to sleep heavily.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beth drifted off herself then. She was dreaming of tropical beaches. But only an hour or two later another soft tread, slightly swifter, slightly lighter, nudged her from her shallow sleep. Poo&#x2014;from Phyllis&#x2014;had discovered the snow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mommy!&#x201d; Poo whispered in a gleeful rush of excitement, touching her mother with taut fingers. &#x201c;Mommy, it&#x2019;s white outside.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shhh, I know,&#x201d; whispered Beth. Poo was five, a kindergartner, whose blond hair had not yet begun to darken, like Bean&#x2019;s. She was impossibly beautiful, and as lively as Bean was grave. She was a bossy, feisty child who tormented her older sister, and occasionally her mother. You couldn&#x2019;t tell her a thing, like Jack.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mommy, Jesus loves us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, he does,&#x201d; said Beth again. The connection between Jesus&#x2019;s love and the snow dated from an obscure remark made by a Sunday-school teacher a few weeks back to Poo, in November, on the occasion of the season&#x2019;s first snowfall. Beth had never been too sure what to make of it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mommy, I&#x2019;m cold. I had a bad dream. Can I come in too?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack sometimes joked that all his life he&#x2019;d wanted to sleep with two women at the same time and now he sometimes woke up with three of &#x2019;em in the same bed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, but be careful,&#x201d; Beth whispered. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t wake Bean or Daddy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But Poo hadn&#x2019;t waited for the answer. That wasn&#x2019;t her style. She climbed aboard and scuttled like a little commando up the gully between her mother and her father, and slid in between them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beth felt the brush of her younger daughter&#x2019;s toes, cold from the long race across the bare floor. Then Poo seemed to merge with her mother, to simply become one with her, their breaths and rhythms joined. Beth pulled the covers up to her neck, felt the embrace of the warmth, its sluggish, numbing power.<br> &nbsp;<br> But she could not get back to sleep. She lay in the silence, feeling the ease and sighs of her daughters. Now and then something ticked in the house, or a draft of uncommonly cold air came through the door. She lay, waiting for unconsciousness, which did not come. Finally, she looked over at the clock. It was almost six. The alarm would go off at six-thirty, and Jack had to be out of the house and in his pickup by seven for a drive to a new job in Boonsboro; the girls had to be fed and dressed for the bus by eight. So finally, Beth decided to get out of bed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Crossing the floor, she pulled her slippers on and then her robe, a red polyester thing from Monkey Ward that had seen better days. She hoped Jack would get her a new one for Christmas in a few weeks, but since he usually did his shopping at the drugstore on Christmas Eve, she knew it to be unlikely. She looked back at the three heads sunk into and embraced by the pillows. Her husband, an athletic and muscular man three years older than her twenty-nine, slept heavily. He looked like an animal in a den, lost in dreamless mammal sleep as the seasons changed. And her two daughters, facing the other direction, out toward the shaded windows, were delicate and lyrical in the dim light beginning to stream in at the margins of the shades. They were tiny and perfect, their nostrils fragile as lace, their lips like candy slices, the whisper of their breaths soft and persistent. But she was aware that it was sometimes far easier to love them when they were in repose, as now, than when they were at each other like wildcats in the backseat of the station wagon. She smiled at them&#x2014;her three charges in the world&#x2014;and felt something profoundly satisfactory move through her. Her family. Hers. Then she crept into the bathroom, quickly squirted some Crest on her toothbrush, and cleaned her teeth. She headed downstairs to start breakfast.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beth walked around the house, pulling up the shades. The morning light was just beginning to show over the trees. Yes, it had snowed; a light powder, unmarked as yet by human traces, lay across everything. Maybe Jesus did love them. The world looked freshly minted. It was radiant as far as she could see. The clouds had cleared overnight. From the kitchen window, over the sink, she could see the white roofs of Burkittsville, a collection of sloping rectangles against the white netting of the snow on the trees. Beyond them was the mountain.<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t much of a mountain, almost more of a large hill in the feckless Blue Ridge chain, which had itself seen better days. But to Beth, who was born and raised in Florida, it was a real mountain, a huge hump, crusted with pines, that rose two thousand or so feet above the town. She knew it had been mined for coal back in the thirties, and some of the old people in the town talked about the great Burkittsville cave-in of thirty-four, which had ended the mining operations, and almost ended Burkittsville until Borg-Warner opened its big plant in Williamsport twenty miles away, where most of the men worked. Up top she could see the red and white towers of the phone company&#x2019;s microwave processing station, or whatever it was.<br> &nbsp;<br> The mountain was something she liked, and in the spring she and the girls would drive to the park and go for long walks along the trails at its base. You got about one thousand feet up it, and there was even an overlook, where you could sit on a little bench and look across the valley, see Burkittsville spread out like a collection of dollhouses, and beyond that the undulating farmland of Maryland. To the left, a dark blur, was Middletown, and farther out was Frederick, the big city. It was a lovely view. The girls adored it. Even Jack liked it, though he wasn&#x2019;t much on views.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beth shook her eyes from the mountain, and returned to reality. She took out the Honey Nut Cheerios, shook the box, and got the bad news. There was enough for only two bowls&#x2014;this meant that the third person down the stairs would have to make do with corn flakes. Beth tried to work out the political permutations. If Bean came down last, it wouldn&#x2019;t matter. Bean liked Honey Nuts, but if she couldn&#x2019;t have them, she&#x2019;d smile and get on with things. Jack and Poo, however, loved Honey Nut Cheerios with the frenzy of zealots. If Poo or Jack came down to see the other finishing the cereal, there&#x2019;d be trouble. The Jack-Poo relationship was the volatile one in the family because Poo was such a replica of her father&#x2014;stubborn, selfish, vain, charming. The whole morning could come apart.<br> &nbsp;<br> Upstairs, Beth heard the shower come on. He was up, that meant, which was a good start to the day, because she didn&#x2019;t want to have to rouse him, a task you wouldn&#x2019;t want to wish on a Russian soldier.<br> &nbsp;<br> But her heart fell.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bean walked in.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Honey, what are you doing up? You don&#x2019;t have to get up yet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mommy,&#x201d; said Bean, one small finger rubbing one sleepy eye, her hair a mess, her little body swaddled in its purple pajamas, &#x201c;I heard something. It scared me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, honey,&#x201d; said Beth, bending to her daughter, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s nothing to be scared of.&#x201d; At that moment a man in black with a large black pistol stepped into the kitchen. She looked up at him, stunned. She heard the steps of other men moving speedily through the house.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mommy, I&#x2019;m scared,&#x201d; said Bean.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two more black-clad men with huge black guns rushed into the kitchen. They seemed so huge and she felt powerless. It seemed the world was full of men with guns.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Please, Mrs. Hummel,&#x201d; said the first man, a blunt, suntanned fellow with shiny white teeth and blank eyes. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make any noise. Don&#x2019;t make any problems.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Beth panicked, started to scream, but a hand came over her mouth roughly, locking it in her throat.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>King of the Celts: Arthurian Legends and Celtic Tradition</h2><p>In a masterful blend of history, geography, and literature, Jean Markale re-creates the true King Arthur, the real-life Celtic warrior-hero who organized the resistance to the Saxon onslaught in fifth-century England.

But Hsieh Ling-yï¿½n (385-433 C. E.) was there before us.&nbsp;</strong></p> During the last decade of his life, living as a recluse high in the mountains of southeast China, he initiated a tradition of "rivers-and-mountains" (shan-shui) poetry that stretches across the millennia in China, a tradition that represents the earliest and most extensive literary engagement with "the wild" in human history. These poems were hugely popular in Hsieh's own time and established him as one of the most innovative and influential poets in the history of Chinese poetry as well as a founder of Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism. Once again David Hinton, a recipient of fellowships from The National Endowment for the Arts and The National Endowment for the Humanities and the winner of a Harold Morton Landon Translation Award from The Academy of American Poets, has produced a fluid and supple translation that does full justice to the rivers-and-mountains of Hsieh Ling-yï¿½n's inspiration.</p><p>DAVID HINTON&#x2019;s original Selected Poems of Tu Fu was the first full-length verse translation of Tu Fu published in America.

Exiled from the Chinese court, Hsieh (385-433 C.E.) explored the wilderness and composed verse about it, inaugurating over a thousand years of Chinese nature poetry. Hinton whose other translations include the classical Chinese poets Li Po and Tu Fu renders Hsieh in an English both concise and flowing. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The All New Purity Cook Book (Classic Canadian Cookbook Series)</h2><p><p> <i>The Purity Cookbook</i> has long been part of family traditions in many homes, and rare first editions are collector's items.

(Jean Pare)</p><h2>Hollywood&#39;s Last Golden Age: Politics, Society, and the Seventies Film in America</h2><p><p>Between 1967 and 1976 a number of extraordinary factors converged to produce an uncommonly adventurous era in the history of American film. The end of censorship, the decline of the studio system, economic changes in the industry, and demographic shifts among audiences, filmmakers, and critics created an unprecedented opportunity for a new type of Hollywood movie, one that Jonathan Kirshner identifies as the "seventies film." In <i>Hollywood's Last Golden Age</i>, Kirshner shows the ways in which key films from this period&#x2015;including <i>Chinatown</i>, <i>Five Easy Pieces</i>, <i>The Graduate</i>, and <i>Nashville</i>, as well as underappreciated films such as <i>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</i>, <i>Klute</i>, and <i>Night Moves</i>&#x2015;were important works of art in continuous dialogue with the political, social, personal, and philosophical issues of their times.</p><p>These "seventies films" reflected the era's social and political upheavals: the civil rights movement, the domestic consequences of the Vietnam war, the sexual revolution, women's liberation, the end of the long postwar economic boom, the Shakespearean saga of the Nixon Administration and Watergate. Hollywood films, in this brief, exceptional moment, embraced a new aesthetic and a new approach to storytelling, creating self-consciously gritty, character-driven explorations of moral and narrative ambiguity. Although the rise of the blockbuster in the second half of the 1970s largely ended Hollywood&#x2019;s embrace of more challenging films, Kirshner argues that seventies filmmakers showed that it was possible to combine commercial entertainment with serious explorations of politics, society, and characters&#x2019; interior lives.</p></p><p>Jonathan Kirshner is Professor in the Department of Political Science at Boston College and the author of numerous books, including <i>Hollywood's Last Golden Age</i>.<p>"<i>Hollywood's Last Golden Age</i> is an absorbing, well-structured look at the decade of American films that many consider the last great era of thoughtful, politically motivated filmmaking before the rise of the blockbuster.... For those who are already well versed in the period it functions as a great refresher which will likely fill in gaps in one's knowledge, and make one reach towards the DVD shelf for a viewing of one of the many remarkable and still-resonant films of the '70s."</p> (Ian Gilchrist <i>Reel Ink</i>)<br><br><p>"Kirshner... offers insightful, well-written interpretations of some two dozen films&#x2015;with briefer references to others&#x2015;that date from 1967 to 1976.... For Kirshner, the primary characteristics of this golden age include a 'moral ambiguity' that portrays the world in shades of gray rather than in black and white; plots driven by imperfect protagonists rather than by frenetic action; a concern for social and political implications; visual styles that were 'often shaky, darker, filtered, or grainy'; and a desire among filmmakers to create serious, meaningful works of art. A useful appendix lists 100 top films from this period, including 20 deemed canonical."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"Kirshner's commentary on these and other films is stimulating. He also provides a useful appendix of one hundred Seventies films. Kirshner's book provides intriguing insights for anyone interested in the relation between film and wider culture."</p> (<i>The Journal of American Culture</i>)<br><br><p>"Kirshner's writing is lively and informative, and the book excels when he discusses long forgotten seventies films (such as, <i>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</i>, <i>Mickey and Nicky</i>, and <i>The Yakuza</i>), suggest new ways to view popular films (although Michael Carelone as a Nixonian character in <i>The Godfather, Part II</i> could have been taken further), or focuses on topics often ignored in surveys of New Hollywood (the rising skepticism many felt towards capitalism, as discussed in relation to <i>Nashville</i>, <i>Network</i>, and <i>Shampoo</i>).... Kirshner's book expands on many themes discussed elsewhere, but his skillful analysis and solid research, especially pertaining to the cultural politics of the era, serves as a great introduction to this rich era of filmmaking."</p> (Julie Lobalzo Wright <i>The Journal of Popular Culture</i>)<br><br><p>"Renewed interest in Hollywood film of the 1970s, evident in documentaries, popular books, and a burgeoning reissue market, has generated myth and hagiography, and <i>Hollywood's Last Golden Age </i>supplies an important corrective to this tendency by substantiating the contexts for key films of the period. Readers of <i>Hollywood's Last Golden Age</i> will likewise be awakened to the ways that the political rhythms and feeling of this time reverberated through American screens, the way that cinema both announced and brought audiences into the 1970s."</p> (Nathan Holmes <i>Journal of American Studies</i>)<br><br><p>"The author, a professor of government at Cornell, draws a clear correlation between the rather startling shift in American filmmaking (increased violence and sexual themes, more overt establishment motifs, the rise of the antihero) and political and social events of the 1950s and early '60s (such as the sexual revolution, the war in Vietnam, the assassinations of key political figures, the Communist witch hunts). Libraries with active film-history collections will want to add this one."</p> (David Pitt <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br><p>"Thoughtful, interesting and engaging.... Kirshner succeeds at a difficult task.... [A}n excellent book, well argued, clearly written, and free of the theoretical jargon that plagues so much film scholarship."</p> (Robert T. Schultz <i>History: Reviews of New Books</i>)<br><br><p>"Jonathan Kirshner, a Cornell University political scientist with a compelling interest in film, argues that this decade (1967&#x2013;1976) was Hollywood's last golden age.... [S]uch classics as <i>The Graduate</i> (1967), <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> (1967), <i>Klute</i> (1971), <i>Midnight Cowboy </i>(1969), <i>Chinatown</i> (1974), and <i>Shampoo</i> (1975) are subjected to intensive examination. These close readings are both the core and the strength of Kirshner's book (p. 2). They afford readers new ways of looking at these films, new insights into the conscious and unconscious motives of the filmmakers, and new frameworks for grasping the meanings and actions of the characters.... I found his book a joy to read and a refreshing reintroduction to the motion pictures of my youth."</p> (Jerold Simmons <i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br><p>"The book intelligently combines social and political history of the period with an analysis of the films created during the time and, in doing so, displays the relation between the two, arguing that the cinema of the 1970s was greatly influenced by the socio-political changes that were taking place in the US."</p> (Tatiana Prorokova (Marburg) <i>Amerikastudien</i>)<br><br><p>"In <i>Hollywood's Last Golden Age</i>, Jonathan Kirshner does a very good job of placing many now-classic movies in relation to the cultural ferment underway in the 1970s. Kirshner draws expertly on a huge range of sources to construct an elegant sociopolitical and cinematic history of the era."</p> (Stephen Prince, Virginia Tech, author of <i>Firestorm: American Film in the Age of Terrorism</i>)</p><h2>For Sinners Only</h2><p><p><i>For Sinners Only</i> is finally back in print!

In truth, however, "Custer&#x2019;s Last Stand" was neither the last of the fighting nor a stand.</p><p>Using innovative and standard archaeological techniques, combined with historical documents and Indian eyewitness accounts, Richard Allan Fox, Jr. vividly replays this battle in astonishing detail. Through bullets, spent cartridges, and other material data, Fox identifies combat positions and tracks soldiers and Indians across the Battlefield. Guided by the history beneath our feet, and listening to the previously ignored Indian testimonies, Fox reveals scenes of panic and collapse and, ultimately, a story of the Custer battle quite different from the fatalistic versions of history. According to the author, the five companies of the Seventh Cavalry entered the fray in good order, following planned strategies and displaying tactical stability. It was the sudden disintegration of this cohesion that caused the troopers&#x2019; defeat. The end came quickly, unexpectedly, and largely amid terror and disarray.

They have won the votes of workers, women, gays, and Jews; turned openly xenophobic ideas into state policy; and pulled besieged centrist parties to the right. How did we get here?<br>In this deeply reported account, Sasha Polakow-Suransky provides a front-row seat to the anger, desperation, and dissent that are driving some voters into the arms of the far right and stirring others to resist. He introduces readers to refugees in the Calais "Jungle" and the angry working-class neighbors who want them out; a World War II refugee-turned-rabbi who became a leading defender of Muslim immigrants; the children of Holocaust survivors who have become apologists for the new right; and alt-right activists and the intellectuals who enable them.<br>Polakow-Suransky chronicles how the backlash against refugees and immigrants has reshaped our political landscape. Ultimately, he argues that the greatest threat comes not from outside, but from within--even established democracies are at risk of betraying their core values and falling apart.</p><p><b>Sasha Polakow-Suransky </b>is the author of <i>The Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Relationship with Apartheid South Africa</i> and an Open Society Foundations fellow.

The bands reserved hunting, fishing, and gathering rights on the lands that would become the northern third of Wisconsin in treaties signed with&nbsp;the federal government in 1837, 1842, and 1854. Those rights, however, would be ignored by the state of Wisconsin for more than a century. When a federal appeals court in 1983 upheld the bands' off-reservation rights, a deep and far-reaching conflict erupted between the Ojibwe bands and some of their non-Native neighbors. <p>Starting in the mid-1980s, protesters and supporters flocked to the boat landings of lakes being spearfished; Ojibwe spearfisher-men were threatened, stoned, and shot at. Peace and protest rallies, marches, and ceremonies galvanized and rocked the local communities and reservations, and individuals and organizations from across the country poured into northern Wisconsin to take sides in the spearfishing dispute.</p><p>From the front lines on lakes to tense, behind-the-scenes maneuvering on and off reservations, <i>The Walleye War</i> tells the riveting story of the spearfishing conflict, drawing on the experiences and perspectives of the members of the Lac du Flambeau reservation and an anthropologist who accompanied them on spearfishing expeditions. We learn of the historical roots and cultural significance of spearfishing and off-reservation treaty rights and we see why many modern Ojibwes and non-Natives view them in profoundly different ways. We also come to understand why the Flambeau tribal council and some tribal members disagreed with the spearfishermen and pursued a policy of negotiation with the state to lease the off-reservation treaty rights for fifty million dollars. Fought with rocks and metaphors, <i>The Walleye War</i> is the story of a Native people's struggle for dignity, identity, and self-preservation in the modern world.</p></p><p>Larry Nesper an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&#34;The Walleye War is an engaging and well-researched work of Native-American ethnohistory.

One of the most vivid, influential, and controversial figures of the founding of America, Hamilton was an unusually prolific and vigorous writer. As a military aide to George Washington, critic of the Articles of Confederation, proponent of ratification of the Constitution, first Secretary of the Treasury, and leader of the Federalist Party, Hamilton devoted himself to the creation of a militarily and economically powerful American nation guided by a strong, energetic republican government. His public and private writings demonstrate the perceptive intelligence, confident advocacy, driving ambition, and profound concern for honor and reputation that contributed both to his astonishing rise to fame and to his tragic early death.<br><br>Arranged chronologically, this volume contains more than 170 letters, speeches, pamphlets, essays, reports, and memoranda written between 1769 and 1804. Included are all fifty-one of Hamilton&#x2019;s contributions to&nbsp;<i>The Federalist</i>, as well as subsequent writings calling for a broad construction of federal power; his famous speech to the Constitutional Convention, which gave rise to accusations that he favored monarchy; and early writings supporting the Revolutionary cause and a stronger central government. His detailed reports as Secretary of the Treasury on the public credit, a national bank, and the encouragement of manufactures present a forward-looking vision of a country transformed by the power of financial markets, centralized banking, and industrial development.<br>Hamilton&#x2019;s sometimes flawed political judgment is revealed in the &#x201c;Reynolds Pamphlet,&#x201d; in which he confessed to adultery in order to defend himself against accusations of corrupt conduct, as well as in his self-destructive pamphlet attack on John Adams during the 1800 presidential campaign. An extensive selection of private letters illuminates Hamilton&#x2019;s complex relationship with George Washington, his deep affection for his wife and children, his mounting fears during the 1790s regarding the Jeffersonian opposition and the French Revolution, and his profound distrust of Aaron Burr.&nbsp;<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b> is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Set in England during Victoria&#x2019;s reign, <em>She Tempts the Duke</em> is the enthrallingly romantic story of Sebastian, who fled to battle, and his return to London, a hardened soldier, drawn to the beautiful, brave lady who helped him and his brothers escape their captivity.<br></p></p><p><p>Three young heirs, imprisoned by an unscrupulous uncle, escaped&#x2014;to the sea, to the streets, to faraway battle&#x2014;awaiting the day when they would return to reclaim their birthright.</p><p>Sebastian Easton always vowed he would avenge his stolen youth and title.

Unexpected passion soon burns dangerously between them, tempting Sebastian to abandon his quest for retribution and fight for a love that could once again set him free.</p><p>Lorraine Heath always dreamed&nbsp;of being a writer.

Part fascinating examination of Hemingway the man in his trying final years and part nifty postmodern procedural, <i>Adios Hemingway</i> will engross Hemingway fans while keeping them in suspense until the final pages.<br></p><p>Leonardo Padura Fuentes is one of Cuba&#39;s most acclaimed writers. He was born in 1955, not far from Hemingway&#39;s Cuban home and has written extensively as a critic and essayist, as well as novelist. A winner of the international Dashiell Hammett prize, his books include a series of detective novels featuring Mario Conde.Mario Conde is a retired Havana cop obsessed with Hemingway, so when the skeletal remains of a man killed on Papa's Cuban estate 40 years earlier are unearthed, it's only natural that the police ask Conde to work the case. A celebrated mystery writer in Cuba, Fuentes offers a fascinating mix of fact and fiction, jumping between present and past, and vividly dramatizing Hemingway's last days in Cuba. What is most fascinating about the book is the character of Conde, torn between his mixed feelings about Hemingway the man and the writer, but drawn to the case like a supplicant to the altar. Fans of Cuban noir will love the cars, the crumbling chic of old Havana, and, of course, the aftertaste of rum-soaked decadence, but best of all, finally, is the priceless anecdote about Ava Gardner's black silk knickers, a souvenir to die for. Give this one to fans of Brazilian Garcia-Roza's Inspector Espinosa series, about another melancholy Latin sleuth who feels what Conde calls "solidarity with writers, crazy people, and drunkards." <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

But in the dim, airless flat, Frances spends lonely days writing in her diary, hearing the sounds of sobs through the pipes from the floor above, and seeing the flitting shadows of men on the stairwell. It's all in her imagination, she's told by her neighbors; the upstairs flat is empty, no one uses the roof. But Frances knows otherwise, and day by day, her sense of foreboding grows even as her sense of herself begins to disintegrate.</p></p><p>Frances Shore has been warned about Saudi Arabia from the word go. En route to join her uncommunicative engineer husband, she tries to ignore the rumors and rumblings she has already heard--women can't drive, alcohol is illegal, morality regulated. But even she is surprised by the airline steward's surreal lesson. The Saudis are "too bloody secretive to have maps," he tells her. "Besides, the streets are never in the same place for more than a few weeks altogether." Frances's first morning in her new home is not quite what she might have expected. There is no telephone, and Andrew has locked the back door behind him (the previous occupant had the front door bricked up so his wife wouldn't encounter her male neighbors). It is, however, similar to the days to come, which oscillate between boredom and fear--the nights broken only by tedious business dinners and sub rosa distilling. When she is allowed outside, she is assailed by official warnings--highway signs reading "YOU ARE FAST, BUT DANGER IS FASTER," a library handout begging, "<i>PLEASE make EVERY effort to return your books if you have to leave the Kingdom hurriedly and unexpectedly.</i>" The outside world is ominous enough, but there's also something odd going on in the apartment building: noise from the supposedly empty flat above. The title of this blackly humorous, frightening novel begins to sound like a reprieve: Frances and Andrew Shore will at least be able to leave the country after 8 months. But Hilary Mantel's final twist destroys any dreams of leaving. As one character had earlier warned: "It isn't the roads in town that are dangerous, it's the roads out."<p>Hilary Mantel is the bestselling author of many novels including <i>Wolf Hall</i>, which won the Man Booker Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. <i>Bring Up the Bodies</i>, Book Two of the Thomas Cromwell Trilogy, was also awarded the Man Booker Prize and the Costa Book Award.

The wind carries it *whoosh* to a pair of raccoons who use it to play tug-o-war. When they run off, a beaver dons the scarf as the perfect winter hat...until it gets tangled on a tree branch. The scarf is lost and found by a series of animals, including a fox and a couple of rascally squirrels, who use it as everything from a swing to a trampoline.</p><p>When all the animals lay claim to the scarf at once, calamity ensues that can only be fixed by a bear, a little patience, and friendship, in this nearly wordless, clever picture book.</p></p><p><p><i>Lost.

Prepare to enter the breathtaking realm of the Four Lands, where beings both noble and sinister have quested and clashed, crossed swords in the names of darkness and light, and engaged in adventures rich with mystery and majesty. <br><br>&#x201c;Terry&#x2019;s place is at the head of the fantasy world.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;Philip Pullman, author of The Golden Compass</p><p><b>Terry Brooks</b>&nbsp;has thrilled readers for decades with his powers of imagination and storytelling.

It was a battle in which they lost many friends, including Jair's most trusted companion, Weapons Master Garet Jax, who had appeared invincible. It seemed as though the siblings had fulfilled their Ohmsford heritage and vanquished the foe&#x2013;the operative word being seemed. Now the story continues in graphic-novel form. The characters and action are true to the Shannara legacy. Here Jair is called to destroy the last fragment of the Ildatch. Using magic, he is able to call forth and become Weapons Master Garet Jax, although this power puts his own soul in jeopardy. This exciting story sets the stage for a sequel. The black-and-white art is expressive and uses creepy shadow to convey the black arts at work. Although the art is classic comic book style and it is printed in standard left-to-right form, the novel should have great appeal to those who like fantasy-adventure manga because of its tone and subject matter. This quick, exciting adventure won't disappoint Brooks's fans, and it is a terrific way to hook reluctant readers, who will want to pick up one of the many Shannara novels to find out more about these characters.<i>&#x2013;Dana Cobern-Kullman, Luther Burbank Middle School, Burbank, CA</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I&#x2019;m happy to tell you more, if only to put off thinking about that smell. It&#x2019;s still coating the back of my throat and clinging to my skin, so here you go.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;d been sent to Kingsbridge, a nice little town by the southwest coast of England. Picturesque, actually, despite the thousands of GIs everywhere, camped in fields, housed in barracks and barns, marching in every direction, whistling at girls, and tossing chewing gum to kids who trailed in their wake. The roar of trucks and tanks tore through the peace and quiet of this seaside town, as it did in plenty others like it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allied forces were here waiting for word to invade occupied Europe. Everyone knew the invasion was around the corner. Not the exact time or place, but with all these soldiers, sailors, and airmen here, the anticipation was building up to a fever pitch. They <i>had</i> to go somewhere, and soon, or else the pressure and the stress of waiting<br>would break even the strongest. Me, I was here because some poor slob got himself washed up on the shore near Slapton, a small seaside town not far from Kingsbridge. It would have passed unnoticed if the beach, Slapton Sands, wasn&#x2019;t being used to practice amphibious landings: the kind of landings that would soon be happening across the Channel, in France.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I work for a guy who&#x2019;s paid to get nervous about stuff like that, who sees conspiracies and danger in every unexplained event. Why did the corpse end up on this particular beach? Was he a German spy, a drunken fisherman, or a downed pilot? How come no one had reported him missing, no civil or military authority? Colonel Samuel Harding is an intelligence officer with Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force, and unanswered questions bother him, so here I am in Kingsbridge to fill in the blanks. I work at SHAEF as well. I have the flaming sword patch on my shoulder to prove it, not to mention orders signed by General Eisenhower himself giving me the authority to go anywhere and question anyone as part of this investigation. Helpful, if some senior officer wants to push a mere captain around.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#x2019;s what led me to Dr. Verniquet and his mortuary. The questions and the corpse. The smell was already overpowering, even though the bag was zipped up tight. The antiseptic smell of the tiled basement room, painted bright white, faded under the onslaught of decay. Think of a slab of beef left out in the sun for a couple of days, then add a dash of metallic odor and a tinge of vomit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you ready, Captain Boyle?&#x201d; Dr. Verniquet said. He was short, with a shock of white hair sticking out behind his ears, marking the last stand ofa receded hairline. He wore a stained white coat, and a lit cigarette dangled from his lips, probably to help mask the odor of decomposition, although in this case it might take an entire pack.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said, aiming for a nonchalant tone. I&#x2019;d seen plenty of corpses, even fished a few ripe ones out of Boston Harbor back when I was a cop, before the war, and before my personal count of dead bodies skyrocketed. I&#x2019;d witnessed a few autopsies as well, and even though I&#x2019;d retched bile in the hall midway through my first, no one had seen me slip out. I&#x2019;d managed to keep it togetherafter that. Cops are supposed to always be in control, and that extended to the morgue. It was part of the job, a duty to the dead, and everyone expected you to get it done without putting your last meal on display. Especially my dad. He was a homicide detective, and he&#x2019;d told me when I was a rookie not to disgrace myself when I got around to my first autopsy. That was<br>easy. I simply hadn&#x2019;t eaten a thing that day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been in cold storage waiting for you to arrive,&#x201d; the elderly doctor said. &#x201c;No one has claimed the body.&#x201d; He gripped the zipper and glanced at me. I nodded.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he pulled the zipper open, waves of putrid stench washed over me, each worse than the last. I tried to breathe, but my body revolted at drawing in more of the rancid air. I blinked, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Dark, bloated flesh, marked by pockets of greyish-white growth on the cheeks and belly. No eyes, no lips. Teeth bared in a hideous grimace.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Show me the bullet wounds,&#x201d; I said, unable to focus my watering eyes, trying for quick, shallow breaths.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; Dr. Verniquet said, pointing to a bicep, seemingly immune to the smell. &#x201c;The bullet went through his arm. A minor wound.&#x201d; He tapped a pencil against a puckered hole on blackened skin, then drew on his cigarette and blew the smoke out his nostrils. I had never taken up the habit, but it looked like a good move. &#x201c;He was killed by this shot to the head. Note the angle.&#x201d; He tapped his pencil again, first on<br>an entry wound high on the forehead, right side, then on the exit wound above the left ear. Or where the ear would have been.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He was shot in the arm while standing up,&#x201d; I said, trying to block out the barrage of odors attacking my senses. I forced myself to study the body, wishing I could simply bolt for the clean air outdoors. The arm wound was on a straight line. &#x201c;Judging from the position of the head shot, the killer was above him when he fired the second shot.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes. The victim may have turned away at the last second,&#x201d; Dr. Verniquet said as ash dropped from his cigarette. He turned his own head upward and to the left, this time using the pencil to demonstrate the trajectory of the bullet. &#x201c;He was almost certainly killed in the water, or thrown in immediately after death.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Because of the grave wax?&#x201d; I asked. I instinctively held my hand over my nose, not that it helped much.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Adipocere,&#x201d; Dr. Verniquet said, nodding. &#x201c;The fatty deposits turn into a white, waxy substance when the body is immersed in water, as has occurred in this unfortunate fellow. But it never happens in the presence of insect life, so we can assume that he went into the water immediately.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The corpse&#x2019;s gut and cheeks were covered in the stuff, which looked like homemade soap mixed with candle drippings. It wasn&#x2019;t pretty, but all it told me was that he wasn&#x2019;t skinny when he was killed. The bottom of the rubber sack was awash in fluids I didn&#x2019;t want to think about. I pulled back the edges and studied the rest of the body. One foot was missing, the other without toes. His fingers were stubs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fish food?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the doctor said. &#x201c;Probably happened close to the shore, before he went out with the tide. Or came in with it. As you can see, there&#x2019;s nothing much left of the soft tissue on his fingers, so there&#x2019;s no hope of fingerprints. I&#x2019;d put his age at about thirty. Five foot eleven inches in height.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That looked about right. What was left of him seemed to be in good shape, too. His chest was broad, and he had a full head of brown hair, darker in some spots. I ran two fingers through the hair and sniffed, trying to block out the overwhelming stench of decomposition and concentrate on what was in his hair.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oil?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, he was covered in petroleum. He may have floated through an oil slick from a sunken ship. Could have happened at any point. Anything else?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, desperate for the sound of the zipper going in reverse. Dr. Verniquet obliged as I gripped the edge of a table to keep from fainting. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see any clothing,&#x201d; I managed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t much. It was all in shreds. Nothing as substantial as a belt or lifejacket. As you saw, the fish had been at him, and between being banged about on the rocks and exposure to salt water and sunlight, his clothing did not hold up well. What we took off was as decayed as he is.&#x201d; The doctor took a flat box from the bottom of the gurney and set it on a table as he trundled off, the broken wheel clacking in protest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were shreds of cloth, the colors of which had been bleached and stained to a dull reddish-brown hue. A uniform? Perhaps. Or workingman&#x2019;s garments. They had a rough feel, probably wool. Not a dressy kind of guy. No labels or telltale stitching where insignia might have been. Useless.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I have been informed that I must list the cause of death as &#x2018;killed in action,&#x2019;&#x201d; Dr. Verniquet said a few minutes later as we sat in his office. There was a fresh cigarette in his mouth and an open window, which helped, even though the fragrance of decay still hung on my uniform and cloyed my nostrils. &#x201c;By the highest authority, or so they said.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;If they were English, it must be MI5,&#x201d; I said. Killed in action meant an end to questions, at least officially.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They were. You&#x2019;re the first Yank who&#x2019;s shown up to take a look. At least now I can put the poor chap in the ground.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;In an unmarked grave,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Certainly,&#x201d; Dr. Verniquet said. &#x201c;I have no idea if he&#x2019;s German, French, or one of ours.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How long was he in the water?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to say precisely,&#x201d; Dr. Verniquet said, grinding out his cigarette. &#x201c;Minimum of a month, perhaps as long as three or four.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Have other bodies washed ashore since the start of the war?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had our share,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Especially in summer 1940, when Jerry attacked the Channel shipping. We had sailors and airmen alike. But then they focused on the London area, and we saw less of the war in the air this far west.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did any of them look like our guy?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not a one,&#x201d; Dr. Verniquet said firmly. &#x201c;None were badly decomposed, and all had their uniforms relatively intact. Some were still in life belts. And their wounds were horrible. When a few twenty-millimeter rounds or a machine-gun burst strikes the human body, the flesh rips apart. This man was shot at close range with a pistol of some sort, mark my words.&#x201d;<br><b>Chapter Two</b><br><br>I walked outside and breathed in the fresh air, happy for each cleansing lungful. The mortuary was on a side street near the police station, where Kaz waited for me in the jeep. His head was tilted back, his eyes closed as he made the mostof the warm April weather and the low, slanting sun.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I hope you haven&#x2019;t worn yourself out talking to the constable,&#x201d; I said, dropping myself into the driver&#x2019;s seat. Kaz smiled, then wrinkled his nose as he opened one eye.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Billy, you smell horrible!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You would too if you&#x2019;d spent time poking a decayed corpse.&#x201d; I filled Kaz in on what I&#x2019;d learned&#x2014;or had not learned from the police surgeon and asked what he&#x2019;d come up with.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nothing, really,&#x201d; Kaz said. &#x201c;I had tea with Constable Miller, who had no idea where the corpse might have come from.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tea? You had tea while I looked at a guy sloshing around in a rubber sack?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t very good, Billy. Day-old teabags, I daresay.&#x201d; For Kaz, that was roughing it. He was used to the finer and more expensive things in life. &#x201c;Constable Miller is beyond retirement age and is staying on for the duration. He is a good man, and diligent in his own way, but he is not at the forefront of criminal investigation.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Great,&#x201d; I said, noticing that Kaz was hanging half out of the jeep. &#x201c;Is it that bad?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Perhaps we should drive. The wind may help,&#x201d; Kaz said. &#x201c;In any case, the body was found on Slapton Sands, which is not in the good constable&#x2019;s jurisdiction. It is part of the army&#x2019;s Assault Training Center, and the soldiers who found him brought the body here to the mortuary.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Constable Miller had no leads?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He said he took one whiff and decided it was an army matter. The military police declined, declaring that it was obviously not an American soldier, and that he&#x2019;d been in the water long before they arrived in this area. The constable did refer me to Inspector Grange at the Dartmouth headquarters of the Devon Constabulary, who is in charge of the investigation, such as it is.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No one wants a smelly corpse,&#x201d; I said, and started the jeep. I headed down Fore Street, the main thoroughfare in Kingsbridge. It was a narrow lane, hemmed in on each side by low, grey granite buildings, each one lower than the last as the road meandered down to the waterfront from the wooded heights above. We waited at an intersection as a long column of GIs marched by at a quick pace, heavy packs and rifles slung over their shoulders. Some were kids, maybe nineteen or twenty tops. I wondered how many of them would end up floating facedown in the Channel before too long. Youthful life could so easily be swallowed by the charnel house of war. I wanted to wash the stench of death away, but I knew it would return. It was all around us, waiting around each corner. Waiting for the invasion, across that cold English Channel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The column passed, the tramp of boots on cobblestones echoing in the distance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drove on. Kingsbridge was at the head of a broad estuary that brought tidal waters up from the Channel a couple of miles to the south, providing a natural safe harbor for small boats. I&#x2019;d noticed the fishing vessels when we drove in, all of them moored and resting on the muddy flats along the quayside. The smell of low tide and rotting fish guts wafted on the breeze.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, camouflage,&#x201d; Kaz said, working to keep a straight face. Kaz enjoyed a good laugh at my expense. And I didn&#x2019;t mind. Kaz was a good pal, the best. He&#x2019;d been through hard times and lived through tremendous losses. The kind of losses that would have sent many tough guys to their knees. So anything that brought a smile to his face was okay by me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;...</p><h2>Ross Macdonald: Four Later Novels (LOA #295): Black Money / The Instant Enemy / The Goodbye Look / The Underground Man (Library of America Ross Macdonald Edition)</h2><p>From his vantage point in Southern California&#x2014;and&nbsp;through the eyes of his great creation, private eye Lew&nbsp;Archer&#x2014;Ross Macdonald (the pseudonymn of Kenneth Millar)&nbsp;fashions a haunting, startlingly&nbsp;immediate vision of modern America: a swirling mix&nbsp;of sexual exploitation, intergenerational conflict, racial&nbsp;animosities, and ecological disaster.<br><br>In <b>Black Money</b>, Archer is hired to find a wealthy man&nbsp;gone missing and soon finds himself investigating a&nbsp;suspicious seven-year-old suicide. The case becomes a&nbsp;peeling away of many levels of deception, delusion,&nbsp;and false identity. Exploring themes of immigration&nbsp;and border-crossing central to Macdonald&#x2019;s own life,&nbsp;<i>Black Money</i> also pays homage to <i>The Great Gatsby</i>,&nbsp;one of his favorite books.<br><br><b>The Instant Enemy</b> begins with Archer&#x2019;s search for a&nbsp;runaway teenage daughter and her troubled, possibly&nbsp;murderous boyfriend, a search that uncovers a&nbsp;morass of hidden wrongs. In an emotionally intense&nbsp;work that reflects the chaos and conflicts of his&nbsp;family&#x2019;s troubled past, Macdonald gives indelible&nbsp;and ultimately tragic expression to the generational&nbsp;conflict and drug culture of the DJHCs.<br><br>An investigation into &#x201c;a rather peculiar burglary&#x201d; takes&nbsp;a drastic turn with the discovery of a body in an abandoned&nbsp;car on a beach in <b>The Goodbye Look</b>, the book&nbsp;that sealed Macdonald&#x2019;s reputation as the preeminent&nbsp;crime novelist of his time.

Youthful rebellion is pitted against the&nbsp;hypocrisies of the older generation in a novel, in&nbsp;Welty&#x2019;s estimation, &#x201c;not only exhilaratingly well&nbsp;done; it is also very moving.&#x201d;<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

In his person and in his pursuits he was a man of extraordinary contrasts. Although he left school at twelve when his father died, he was eventually awarded honorary degrees from Yale University, the University of Missouri, and Oxford University. His career encompassed such varied occupations as printer, Mississippi riverboat pilot, journalist, travel writer, and publisher. He made fortunes from his writing but toward the end of his life he had to resort to lecture tours to pay his debts. He was hot-tempered, profane, and sentimental<b> </b>and also pessimistic, cynical, and tortured by self-doubt. His nostalgia helped produce some of his best books. He lives in American letters as a great artist, the writer whom William Dean Howells called &#x201c;the Lincoln of our literature.&#x201d;Chapter 1 Nibiwa win o-dibendan aki.1<br><br> Eng. A gallant tract<br><br> Of land it is!<br><br> Meercraft. &#x2019;Twill yield a pound an acre:<br><br> We must let cheap ever at first. But, sir,<br><br> This looks too large for you, I see.<br><br> June, 18&#x2014;. Squire Hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks, called the &#x201c;stile,&#x201d; in front of his house, contemplating the morning.<br><br> The locality was Obedstown, East Tennessee. You would not know that Obedstown stood on the top of a mountain, for there was nothing about the landscape to indicate it&#x2014;but it did: a mountain that stretched abroad over whole counties, and rose very gradually. The district was called the &#x201c;Knobs of East Tennessee,&#x201d; and had a reputation like Nazareth,2 as far as turning out any good thing was concerned.<br><br> The Squire&#x2019;s house was a double log cabin, in a state of decay; two or three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold, and lifted their heads sadly whenever Mrs. Hawkins or the children stepped in and out over their bodies. Rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard; a bench stood near the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of water and a gourd; a cat had begun to drink from the pail, but the exertion was overtaxing her energies, and she had stopped to rest. There was an ash-hopper by the fence, and an iron pot, for soft-soap-boiling, near it.<br><br> This dwelling constituted one-fifteenth of Obedstown; the other fourteen houses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the corn-fields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the city and not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on his eyes for information.<br><br> &#x201c;Squire&#x201d; Hawkins got his title from being postmaster of Obedstown&#x2014;not that the title properly belonged to the office, but because in those regions the chief citizens always must have titles of some sort, and so the usual courtesy had been extended to Hawkins. The mail was monthly, and sometimes amounted to as much as three or four letters at a single delivery. Even a rush like this did not fill up the postmaster&#x2019;s whole month, though, and therefore he &#x201c;kept store&#x201d; in the intervals.<br><br> The Squire was contemplating the morning. It was balmy and tranquil, the vagrant breezes were laden with the odor of flowers, the murmur of bees was in the air, there was everywhere that suggestion of repose that summer woodlands bring to the senses, and the vague, pleasurable melancholy that such a time and such surroundings inspire.<br><br> Presently the United States mail arrived, on horseback. There was but one letter, and it was for the postmaster. The long-legged youth who carried the mail tarried an hour to talk, for there was no hurry; and in a little while the male population of the village had assembled to help. As a general thing, they were dressed in homespun &#x201c;jeans,&#x201d; blue or yellow&#x2014;there were no other varieties of it; all wore one suspender and sometimes two&#x2014;yarn ones knitted at home,&#x2014;some wore vests, but few wore coats. Such coats and vests as did appear, however, were rather picturesque than otherwise, for they were made of tolerably fanciful patterns of calico&#x2014;a fashion which prevails there to this day among those of the community who have tastes above the common level and are able to afford style. Every individual arrived with his hands in his pockets; a hand came out occasionally for a purpose, but it always went back again after service; and if it was the head that was served, just the cant that the dilapidated straw hat got by being uplifted and rooted under, was retained until the next call altered the inclination; many hats were present, but none were erect and no two were canted just alike. We are speaking impartially of men, youths and boys. And we are also speaking of these three estates when we say that every individual was either chewing natural leaf tobacco prepared on his own premises, or smoking the same in a corn-cob pipe. Few of the men wore whiskers; none wore moustaches; some had a thick jungle of hair under the chin and hiding the throat&#x2014;the only pattern recognized there as being the correct thing in whiskers; but no part of any individual&#x2019;s face had seen a razor for a week.<br><br> These neighbors stood a few moments looking at the mail carrier reflectively while he talked; but fatigue soon began to show itself, and one after another they climbed up and occupied the top rail of the fence, hump-shouldered and grave, like a company of buzzards assembled for supper and listening for the death-rattle. Old Damrell said:<br><br> &#x201c;Tha hain&#x2019;t no news &#x2019;bout the jedge, hit ain&#x2019;t likely?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Cain&#x2019;t tell for sartin; some thinks he&#x2019;s gwyne to be &#x2019;long toreckly, and some thinks &#x2019;e hain&#x2019;t. Russ Mosely he tole ole Hanks he mought git to Obeds tomorrer or nex&#x2019; day he reckoned.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I wisht I knowed. I got a prime sow and pigs in the cote-house,3 and I hain&#x2019;t got no place for to put &#x2019;em. If the jedge is a gwyne to hold cote, I got to roust &#x2019;em out, I reckon. But tomorrer&#x2019;ll do, I &#x2019;spect.&#x201d;<br><br> The speaker bunched his thick lips together like the stem-end of a tomato and shot a bumble-bee dead that had lit on a weed seven feet away. One after another the several chewers expressed a charge of tobacco juice and delivered it at the deceased with steady aim and faultless accuracy.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a stirrin&#x2019;, down &#x2019;bout the Forks?&#x201d; continued Old Damrell.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I dunno, skasely. Ole Drake Higgins he&#x2019;s ben down to Shelby las&#x2019; week. Tuck his crap down; couldn&#x2019;t git shet o&#x2019; the most uv it; hit warn&#x2019;t no time for to sell, he say, so he fotch it back agin, &#x2019;lowin&#x2019; to wait tell fall. Talks &#x2019;bout goin&#x2019; to Mozouri&#x2014;lots uv &#x2019;ems talkin&#x2019; that-away down thar, Ole Higgins say. Cain&#x2019;t make a livin&#x2019; here no mo&#x2019;, sich times as these. Si Higgins he&#x2019;s ben over to Kaintuck n&#x2019; married a high-toned gal thar, outen the fust families, an&#x2019; he&#x2019;s come back to the Forks with jist a hell&#x2019;s-mint o&#x2019; whoop-jamboree notions, folks says. He&#x2019;s tuck an&#x2019; fixed up the ole house like they does in Kaintuck, he say, an&#x2019; tha&#x2019;s ben folks come cler from Turpentine for to see it. He&#x2019;s tuck an&#x2019; gawmed it all over on the inside with plarsterin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s plarsterin&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I dono. Hit&#x2019;s what he calls it. Ole Mam Higgins, she tole me. She say she warn&#x2019;t gwyne to hang out in no sich a dern hole like a hog. Says it&#x2019;s mud, or some sich kind o&#x2019; nastness that sticks on n&#x2019; kivers up everything. Plarsterin&#x2019;, Si calls it.&#x201d;<br><br> This marvel was discussed at considerable length; and almost with animation. But presently there was a dog-fight over in the neighborhood of the blacksmith shop, and the visitors slid off their perch like so many turtles and strode to the battle-field with an interest bordering on eagerness. The Squire remained, and read his letter. Then he sighed, and sat long in meditation. At intervals he said:<br><br> &#x201c;Missouri. Missouri. Well, well, well, everything is so uncertain.&#x201d;<br><br> At last he said:<br><br> &#x201c;I believe I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x2014;A man will just rot, here. My house, my yard, everything around me, in fact, shows that I am becoming one of these cattle&#x2014;and I used to be thrifty in other times.&#x201d;<br><br> He was not more than thirty-five, but he had a worn look that made him seem older. He left the stile, entered that part of his house which was the store, traded a quart of thick molasses for a coonskin and a cake of beeswax to an old dame in linsey-woolsey,4 put his letter away, and went into the kitchen. His wife was there, constructing some dried apple pies; a slovenly urchin of ten was dreaming over a rude weather-vane of his own contriving; his small sister, close upon four years of age, was sopping corn-bread in some gravy left in the bottom of a frying-pan and trying hard not to sop over a finger-mark that divided the pan through the middle&#x2014;for the other side belonged to the brother, whose musings made him forget his stomach for the moment; a negro woman was busy cooking, at a vast fire-place. Shiftlessness and poverty reigned in the place.<br><br> &#x201c;Nancy, I&#x2019;ve made up my mind. The world is done with me, and perhaps I ought to be done with it. But no matter&#x2014;I can wait. I am going to Missouri. I won&#x2019;t stay in this dead country and decay with it. I&#x2019;ve had it on my mind some time. I&#x2019;m going to sell out here for whatever I can get, and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and start.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Anywhere that suits you, suits me, Si. And the children can&#x2019;t be any worse off in Missouri than they are here, I reckon.&#x201d;<br><br> Motioning his wife to a private conference in their own room, Hawkins said: &#x201c;No, they&#x2019;ll be better off. I&#x2019;ve looked out for them, Nancy,&#x201d; and his face lighted. &#x201c;Do you see these papers? Well, they are evidence that I have taken up Seventy-five Thousand Acres of Land in this county&#x2014;think what an enormous fortune it will be some day! Why, Nancy, enormous don&#x2019;t express it&#x2014;the word&#x2019;s too tame! I tell you, Nancy&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For goodness sake, Si&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wait, Nancy, wait&#x2014;let me finish&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve been secretly boiling and fuming with this grand inspiration for weeks, and I must talk or I&#x2019;ll burst! I haven&#x2019;t whispered to a soul&#x2014;not a word&#x2014;have had my countenance under lock and key, for fear it might drop something that would tell even these animals here how to discern the gold mine that&#x2019;s glaring under their noses. Now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it in the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly&#x2014;five or ten dollars&#x2014;the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an acre now, but some day people will be glad to get it for twenty dollars, fifty dollars, a hundred dollars an acre! What should you say to&#x201d; [here he dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see that there were no eavesdroppers,] &#x201c;a thousand dollars an acre!<br><br> &#x201c;Well you may open your eyes and stare! But it&#x2019;s so. You and I may not see the day, but they&#x2019;ll see it. Mind I tell you, they&#x2019;ll see it. Nancy, you&#x2019;ve heard of steamboats, and may be you believed in them&#x2014;of course you did. You&#x2019;ve heard these cattle here scoff at them and call them lies and humbugs,&#x2014;but they&#x2019;re not lies and humbugs, they&#x2019;re a reality and they&#x2019;re going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they are now. They&#x2019;re going to make a revolution in this world&#x2019;s affairs that will make men dizzy to contemplate. I&#x2019;ve been watching&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve been watching while some people slept, and I know what&#x2019;s coming.<br><br> &#x201c;Even you and I will see the day that steamboats will come up that little Turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours&#x2014;and in high water they&#x2019;ll come right to it! And this is not all, Nancy&#x2014;it isn&#x2019;t even half! There&#x2019;s a bigger wonder&#x2014;the railroad! These worms here have never even heard of it&#x2014;and when they do they&#x2019;ll not believe in it. But it&#x2019;s another fact. Coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an hour&#x2014;heavens and earth, think of that, Nancy! Twenty miles an hour. It makes a man&#x2019;s brain whirl. Some day, when you and I are in our graves, there&#x2019;ll be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles&#x2014;all the way down from the cities of the Northern States to New Orleans&#x2014;and its got to run within thirty miles of this land&#x2014;may be even touch a corner of it. Well, do you know, they&#x2019;ve quit burning wood in some places in the Eastern States? And what do you suppose they burn? Coal!&#x201d; [He bent over and whispered again:] &#x201c;There&#x2019;s whole worlds of it on this land! You know that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch?&#x2014;well, that&#x2019;s it. You&#x2019;ve taken it for rocks; so has every body here; and they&#x2019;ve built little dams and such things with it. One man was going to build a chimney out of it. Nancy I expect I turned as white as a sheet! Why, it might have caught fire and told everything. I showed him it was too crumbly. Then he was going to build it of copper ore&#x2014;splendid yellow forty-per-cent. ore! There&#x2019;s fortunes upon fortunes of copper ore on our land! It scared me to death, the idea of this fool starting a smelting furnace in his house without knowing it, and getting his dull eyes opened. And then he was going to build it of iron ore! There&#x2019;s mountains of iron ore here, Nancy&#x2014;whole mountains of it. I wouldn&#x2019;t take any chances. I just stuck by him&#x2014;I haunted him&#x2014;I never let him alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the chimneys in this dismal country. Pine forests, wheat land, corn land, iron, copper, coal&#x2014;wait till the railroads come, and the steamboats! We&#x2019;ll never see the day, Nancy&#x2014;never in the world&#x2014;never, never, never, child. We&#x2019;ve got to drag along, drag along, and eat crusts in toil and poverty, all hopeless and forlorn&#x2014;but they&#x2019;ll ride in coaches, Nancy! They&#x2019;ll live like the princes of the earth; they&#x2019;ll be courted and worshiped; their names will be known from ocean to ocean! Ah, well-a-day! Will they ever come back here, on the railroad and the steamboat, and say &#x2018;This one little spot shall not be touched&#x2014;this hovel shall be sacred&#x2014;for here our father and our mother suffered for us, thought for us, laid the foundations of our future as solid as the hills!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You are a great, good, noble soul, Si Hawkins, and I am an honored woman to be the wife of such a man&#x201d;&#x2014;and the tears stood in her eyes when she said it. &#x201c;We will go to Missouri. You are out of your place, here, among these groping dumb creatures. We will find a higher place, where you can walk with your own kind, and be understood when you speak&#x2014;not stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue. I would go anywhere, anywhere in the wide world with you. I would rather my body should starve and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in this lonely land.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Spoken like yourself, my child! But we&#x2019;ll not starve, Nancy. Far from it. I have a letter from Eschol Sellers&#x2014;just came this day. A letter that&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll read you a line from it!&#x201d;<br><br> He flew out of the room. A shadow blurred the sunlight in Nancy&#x2019;s face&#x2014;there was uneasiness in it, and disappointment. A procession of disturbing thoughts began to troop through her mind. Saying nothing aloud, she sat with her hands in her lap; now and then she clasped them, then unclasped them, then tapped the ends of the fingers together; sighed, nodded, smiled&#x2014;occasionally paused, shook her head. This pantomime was the elocutionary expression of an unspoken soliloquy which had something of this shape:</p><h2>The Workaholics Anonymous Book of Recovery: Second Edition</h2><p>This is the first book on Work Addiction healing published for Workaholics by Workaholics. The Workaholics Anonymous Book of Recovery is somewhat similar in style to that of the Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book. As such, it includes a full format and instructions for leading a W.A. meeting as well as the 20 Questions about determining if workaholism is affecting your life. Also included are many members&#39; stories of experience, strength, and hope including a discussion on each of the 12 Steps of W.A. Near the back of the book you will find a lighter side of recovery section with a plethora of great slogans/memorable quotes allowing the reader to access serenity whilst the linear thinking intellect cannot help but take a break and laugh at itself. Although recovery from any addiction must, we believe, include face to face fellowship with others, this book is a comprehensive record of the healing and wisdom of many W.A.&#39;s all collected in one place. Recovery from any addiction is a fair amount of work but is much easier if you enlist others who have gone before you to help out. It is our hope that this book can be just that - an aid in conducting meetings as well as helping members with their individual recoveries.

Surveys show that religious people think they are happier than secularists, and secularists think they are happier than religious people. Liberals believe they are happier than conservatives, and conservatives disagree. In fact, almost every group thinks it is happier than everyone else. In this provocative new book, Arthur C. Brooks explodes the myths about happiness in America. As he did in the controversial <i>Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compassionate Conservatism</i>, Brooks examines vast amounts of evidence and empirical research to uncover the truth about who is happy in America, who is not, and-most important-why. He finds that there is a real happiness gap&#x201d; in America today, and it lies disconcertingly close to America's cultural and political fault lines. The great divide between the happy and the unhappy in America, Brooks shows, is largely due to differences in social and cultural values. The values that bring happiness are faith, charity, hard work, optimism, and individual liberty. Secularism, excessive reliance on the state to solve problems, and an addiction to security all promote unhappiness. What can be done to maximize America's happiness? Replete with the unconventional wisdom for which Brooks has come to be known, <i>Gross National Happiness</i> offers surprising and illuminating conclusions about how our government can best facilitate Americans in their pursuit of happiness.</p><p><b>Arthur C. Brooks</b> is Louis A. Bantle Professor of Business and Government Policy at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. The author of <i>Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compassionate Conservatism</i>, Brooks writes widely about the connections between culture, politics, and economic life in America, and his work appears frequently in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and other publications. He is a native of Seattle, Washington, and currently lives in Syracuse, New York, with his wife Ester and their three children."Arthur Brooks makes me--how else to put it?--happy. He makes me grossly, nationally happy. If you want to be a real American you need to pause in your life and your liberty and pursue some happiness by reading this book." -- <i>P.J. O'Rourke</i><br><br>"Arthur Brooks may be the most innovative and creative analyst of public policy in America today. His insights are in a different league and may lead to an entirely new approach to thinking through public policy. <i>Gross National Happiness</i> is a must read for every person who wants to understand what policies America needs." -- <i>Newt Gingrich</i><br><br>"Happiness is God, marriage, and work. A Republican campaign slogan? No: hard science, as collected by Arthur C. Brooks, emerging as one of the leading--and most original--social observers of his generation." -- <i>David Frum, author of <i>Dead Right</i> and <i>Comeback</i></i><br><br>"Happiness is an idea etched into our national creed. But what does it mean, exactly? With intriguing statistics and engaging examples, Arthur Brooks explores what makes us happy, which types of people are happiest, and what it means for our nation's future. <i>Gross National Happiness</i> is a fresh look on one of America's oldest tenets--how the pursuit of happiness makes America great." -- <i>Carl J. Schramm, president and chief executive officer of the Kauffman Foundation and author of <i>The Entrepreneurial Imperative</i></i><br><br>"In this splendid volume, Arthur C. Brooks cements his reputation as one of the nation's premier students of American society. Always driven by data--not ideology--he offers an authoritative account of the social bases of happiness. Just as important, he explores the public policy implications of his findings. It is a fun read, and should put a smile on the face of even the most unhappy among us." -- <i>William A. Donohue, President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights</i><br><br>"Is anybody happy in America? Actually, a lot of Americans are--and they're not necessarily the ones you'd think. In <i>Gross National Happiness</i>, Arthur Brooks tells us why supposedly crabby conservatives are actually happier than supposedly lighthearted liberals--and what all of us can do to find more happiness in our lives." -- <i>Michael Barone, Senior Writer for <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> and co-author of <i>The Almanac of American Politics</i></i></p><h2>The Wood Carver&#39;s Dozen: A Collection of 12 Beautiful Projects for Beginners</h2><p>If you want to join the woodworking and carving renaissance, <em>Woodcarver's Dozen</em> is the perfect starting point.

She is also a professional lyricist and a licensed wild bird rehabilitator. She lives in Oklahoma with her husband, artist Larry Dixon, and their flock of parrots. She can be found at mercedeslackey.com.No matter how comfortable he was, Skif slept like a cat, with one eye open and one ear cocked, in case trouble stole upon him, thinking to catch him unaware. So even though he didn&#x2019;t know <b>what</b> woke him, when he woke, he came alert all at once, and instead of jumping to his feet, he stayed frozen in place, listening.<p>Wood creaked slightly, somewhere in the loft. Was it a footstep? The sound came again, a trifle nearer, then fabric brushed against something harder. There was someone up here with him.</p><p>Now, it wouldn&#x2019;t be one of the laundry servants on proper business; they came up the stair, clumping and talking loudly. It <b>might</b> be a servant or a page come up here to nap or escape work&#x2014;if it was, although Skif would have a slight advantage in that the other wouldn&#x2019;t want to be caught, he had a profound dis-advantage in that he didn&#x2019;t belong here himself, and the other could legitimately claim to have heard something overhead and gone to investigate. If that was the case, he&#x2019;d be stuck under this tub until the other ï¿½person left.</p><p>It might also be something and someone entirely different&#x2014;a thief, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to be found any more than Skif did, who might flee, or might fight, depending on the circumstances, if Skif came out of hiding.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know enough yet; better to wait. It was highly unlikely that the other would choose Skif&#x2019;s particular tub to hide himself or anything else underneath. It was out of the way and smallish, and Skif had chosen it for precisely those reasons. Instead, he peered under the edge of it, as the surreptitious sounds moved closer, thanking his luck that it wasn&#x2019;t dusty up here. Now would be a bad time to sneeze.</p><p>It sounded, given the direction the sounds were coming from, as if the unknown had gotten into the loft the same way that Skif had, through the gable window at the end. Skif narrowed his eyes, waiting for something to come into his area of vision among the slats of the wooden tubs. The light was surprisingly good up here, but the sun was all wrong for Skif to see a shadow that might give him some notion of who the other intruder was. The creaking gave Skif a good idea that the fellow moved toward the stairs, which meant he was at least <i>thinking</i> of using them to descend into the laundry itself. That wasn&#x2019;t an option Skif would have chosen&#x2014;unless, of course, the fellow was a thief, and was planning on purloining something from the laundry itself. There was plenty of stuff to steal in there; silk handkerchiefs and scarves, the embroidered ribbons that the young ladies of the household liked to use for their necks and hair and the young men liked to give them, the gossamer veils they wore in public&#x2014;all light, easy to carry, presumably easy to sell. The only reason Skif hadn&#x2019;t helped himself before this was that he didn&#x2019;t know where to dispose of such things and was not about to share his loot with Kalchan.</p><p>A foot slid slowly into view; not a big foot, and most importantly of all, not a foot clad in the soled sock of a page or liveried indoor servant. This was a foot in a half-boot of very flexible black leather, laced tight to the ankle and calf, much worn and patched, not much larger than his own, attached to a leg in rusty black trews with worn places along the hem. This foot, and the person who wore those trews, did not belong here. No one in Lord Orthallen&#x2019;s service wore anything of the sort.</p><p>Skif made a quick decision, and struck. Before the other knew he was there, Skif&#x2019;s hand darted from under the tub, and Skif had the fellow&#x2019;s ankle held fast in a hand that was a lot stronger than it looked.</p><p>Skif had half expected a struggle, or at least an attempt to get free, but the owner of the ankle had more sense than that&#x2014;or was more afraid of the attention that the sounds of a struggle would bring than anything Skif could do to him. So now, it was the other&#x2019;s turn to freeze.</p><p>Skif mentally applauded his decision. He thought he had a good idea of what was going through the other fellow&#x2019;s mind. Now, the arm that Skif had snaked out from beneath the tub was clad in a sleeve that was more patch than whole cloth. So Skif obviously didn&#x2019;t belong here either, and the two of them were at an equal advantage and disadvantage. For either to make noise or fuss would mean that both would be caught&#x2014;and no point in trying to claim that one had seen the other sneak over the wall and followed to catch him either. An honest boy would have pounded on the back entrance to report the intruder, not climbed up after him. No, no&#x2014;if one betrayed the other, both of them would be thrown to the City Guard.</p><p>So the other fellow did the prudent thing; he stayed in place once Skif let go of him so that Skif could slip out from under the tub. Like it or not, for the moment they were partners in crime. Skif, however, had a plan.</p><p>There was a moment when the other <b>could</b> have tried to knock Skif out and make a run for it, but he didn&#x2019;t. Such an action would have been noisy, of course, and he still might have been caught, but with one unconscious or semiconscious boy on the floor to distract those who would come clambering up here, he might have been able to get away. Skif breathed a sigh of relief when he was all the way out from under the tub and was able to kneel next to it, looking up at the interloper.</p><p>What he saw was a boy of about fifteen, but small for his age, so that he wasn&#x2019;t a great deal taller than Skif. His thin face, as closed and impassive as any statue&#x2019;s, gave away no hint of what he was thinking. His eyes narrowed when he got a good look at his captor, but there was no telling what emotion lay behind the eyes.</p><p>His clothing was better than Skif&#x2019;s&#x2014;but then again, whose wasn&#x2019;t? Skif wore every shirt he owned&#x2014;three, all ragged, all inexpertly patched by his own hands, all faded into an indeterminate brown&#x2014;with a knitted tunic that was more hole than knit over the top of it all. His linen trews, patched as well, were under his woolen trews, which for a change, had been darned except for the seat which sported a huge patch made from an old canvas tent. This boy&#x2019;s clothing was at least all the same color and the patches were of the same sort of material as the original. In fact, unless you were as close as Skif was, you wouldn&#x2019;t notice the patches much.</p><p>He had long hair of a middling brown color, and a headband of dark braided string to keep it out of his eyes. His eyes matched his hair, and if he&#x2019;d been fed as well as one of the page boys his face would have been round; as it was, the bones showed clearly, though not nearly as sharply defined as Skif&#x2019;s.</p><p>There were other signs of relative prosperity; the other boy&#x2019;s wrists weren&#x2019;t as thin as Skif&#x2019;s, and he showed no signs of the many illnesses that the poor were prone to in the winter. If he was a thief&#x2014;and there was little doubt in Skif&#x2019;s mind that he was&#x2014;this boy was a good enough thief to be doing well.</p><p>The two of them stared at each other for several moments. It was the older boy who finally broke the silence.</p><p>&#x201c;Wot ye want?&#x201d; he asked, in a harsh whisper.</p><p>Until that moment when he&#x2019;d seized the other&#x2019;s ankle, Skif hadn&#x2019;t known what he wanted, but the moment his hand had touched leather, his plan had sprung up in his mind.</p><p>&#x201c;Teach me,&#x201d; he whispered, and saw with satisfaction the boy&#x2019;s eyes widen with surprise, then his slow nod.</p><p>He squatted down beside Skif, who beckoned to him to follow. On hands and knees, Skif led him into the maze of tubs and empty packing crates until they were hidden from view against the wall, next to the chimney.</p><p>There they settled, screened by stacks of buckets needing repair. From below came the steady sounds of the laundry, which should cover any conversation of theirs.</p><p>&#x201c;Ye ain&#x2019;t no page, an&#x2019; ye ain&#x2019;t got no reason t&#x2019;be in the wash house. Wot ye doin&#x2019; here?&#x201d; the boy asked, more curious than annoyed.</p><p>Skif shrugged. &#x201c;Same as you, only not so good,&#x201d; he replied. He explained his ruse to get fed to the boy, whose lips twitched into a thin smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Not bad done, fer a little,&#x201d; he acknowledged. &#x201c;Noboddie never pays mind t&#x2019;littles. Ye cud do better, though. Real work, not this pilferin&#x2019; bits uv grub. I kin get through places a mun can&#x2019;t, an ye kin get where I can&#x2019;t. We might cud work t&#x2019;gether.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I want ye t&#x2019;teach me,&#x201d; Skif whispered back. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t keep runnin&#x2019; this ferever. Won&#x2019; look like no page much longer.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy snorted. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t need to. Here, shake on&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He held out his hand, a thin, hard, and strong hand, and Skif took it, cementing their bargain with a shake. &#x201c;M&#x2019;name&#x2019;s Deek,&#x201d; the boy said, releasing his hand.</p><p>Skif was happy to note that Deek hadn&#x2019;t tried to crush his hand in his grip or otherwise show signs of being a bully. &#x201c;Call me Skif,&#x201d; he offered.</p><p>Deek grinned. &#x201c;Good. Now, you stay here&#x2014;I come back in a tick, an&#x2019; we&#x2019;ll scoot out by th&#x2019; back t&#x2019;gether.&#x201d; He cocked his head down at the floor, and it was pretty clear that there wasn&#x2019;t anyone working down in the laundry anymore. It was probably time for supper; the laundresses and some of the other servants ate long before their betters, and went to bed soon after sundown, for their work started before sunrise.</p><p>Skif nodded; he saw no reason to doubt that Deek would play him false, since he was sitting on the only good route of escape. He and Deek made their way back to Skif&#x2019;s tub; Skif ducked back inside, and Deek crept down the stairs into the laundry.</p><p>Deek came back up quickly, and the quick peek of silk from the now slightly-bulging breast of his tunic told Skif all he needed to know. As he had expected, Deek had managed to slip downstairs, purloin small items of valuable silk, and get back up without anyone catching sight of him. As long as he took small things, items unlikely to be missed for a while, that weren&#x2019;t such rare dainties as to be too recognizable, it was quite likely that the owners themselves would assume they&#x2019;d been mislaid. No specially embroidered handkerchiefs, for example, or unusual colors of veils. He beckoned to Skif, who followed him out over the roof, both of them lying as flat as stalking cats as they wiggled their way along the tiles, to minimize the chance of someone spotting them from below. From this position, they couldn&#x2019;t see much; just the lines of drying linens in the yard, the tops of bushes past the linens that marked the gardens, and the bulk of the magnificent mansion beyond. If anyone looked out of the windows of the mansion, they <b>would</b> be spotted.</p><p>Not likely though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>--Reprinted from Take a Thief by Mercedes Lackey by permission of DAW, a member of Penguin Putnam Inc.

He lives at the beach with his wife, daughter, son, and two cats.TUPELO, MISSISSIPPI<br><br> Lordy, thought the boy. It&#x2019;s a miracle for sure.<br><br> He was seven and a half years old&#x2014;the man of the house, really, what with his daddy being away in Como, and he had never seen anything like the fearful wonder of the newly chiseled monument.<br><br> here lies jesse garon presley.<br><br> deeply beloved of his mother gladys, father vernon, <br><br> and brother elvis.<br><br> a soul so pure, the good lord could not bear <br><br> to be apart from him.<br><br> born jan. 8, 1935,<br><br> taken unto god jan. 8, 1935.<br><br> Despite the unseasonable heat of the evening, gooseflesh ran up his thin arms as he read the words again. Whippoorwills and crickets trilled their amazement in the sweet, warm air. With a pounding heart, the boy inched forward and muttered hoarsely, &#x201c;Jesse, are you here?&#x201d;<br><br> The stone was cut from blindingly white marble that fairly glowed in the setting sun. The inscription had been inlaid with real gold&#x2014;he was almost certain of that. He ran his fingers over the words and the cold, hard stone, as if afraid to discover that they weren&#x2019;t real.<br><br> It must have cost a king&#x2019;s ransom . . .<br><br> An enormous bunch of store-bought flowers had been placed upon a patch of freshly broken earth that still lay at the foot of the monument. Hundreds of tiny beads of water covered the petals and caught the last golden rays of daylight.<br><br> He dropped down on his knees as if he were in church and stared at the impossible vision for many minutes, heedless of the dirt he was getting on his old dungarees. He remained virtually motionless until one hand reached out and his fingers again brushed the surface of the headstone.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, my,&#x201d; he whispered.<br><br> Then Elvis Aaron Presley leapt to his feet and ran so fast that he raised a trail of dust as he sprinted down the gravel lane, away from the pauper&#x2019;s section of the Priceville Cemetery, a-hollerin&#x2019; for his mama.<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll probably get his ass whupped, the poor little bastard.&#x201d; Slim Jim Davidson smiled as he said it, peering over the sunglasses he had perched on his nose.<br><br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; asked the woman who was sitting next to him in the rear seat of the gaudy red Cadillac. You didn&#x2019;t see babies like this every day. Slim Jim had seen to the detailing himself. The paint job, the bison leather seats, everything.<br><br> &#x201c;For telling lies,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Headstones don&#x2019;t just appear like that, you know. They&#x2019;re gonna think he made it up, and when he won&#x2019;t take it back, there&#x2019;ll be hell to pay.&#x201d;<br><br> The woman seemed to give the statement more thought than it was really due. &#x201c;I suppose so,&#x201d; she said after a few seconds.<br><br> Slim Jim could tell she didn&#x2019;t approve. They were all the same, these people. They&#x2019;d bomb an entire city into rubble without batting an eye, but they looked at you like you were some sort of hoodlum if you even suggested raising your hand against a snot-nosed kid. Or a smart-mouth dame, for that matter.<br><br> And this O&#x2019;Brien, she was a helluva smart-mouth dame.<br><br> She&#x2019;d kept her trap shut, though, while they&#x2019;d been watching the Presley kid. In fact, she seemed to be fascinated by him. They&#x2019;d been waiting in the Caddy up on Old Saltillo Road for nearly an hour before he showed. Long enough for Slim Jim to wonder if they were pissing their time up against a wall. But the kid did show, just as his cousin said he would. And he&#x2019;d heard O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s stifled gasp when the small figure first appeared, walking out of a stand of trees about two hundred yards away.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s him, all right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Damned if it&#x2019;s not.&#x201d;<br><br> Slim Jim had grabbed the contract papers and made to get out of the car right then and there. He&#x2019;d had enough of sitting still. His butt had fallen asleep, and he was downright bored.<br><br> But O&#x2019;Brien shook her head. &#x201c;Not here.&#x201d;<br><br> He&#x2019;d bristled at that. His temper had frayed during the long wait. Long enough even to make him feel some sympathy for the cops who&#x2019;d had to stake him out once or twice. But he took her &#x201c;advice&#x201d; because it was always worth taking.<br><br> Her advice had cost him a goddamn packet, too, over the course of their relationship. But along the way, Slim Jim Davidson had learned that you had to spend money to make it. Problem was that up until recently, he didn&#x2019;t have no money to spend. None of his own, anyway. And spending other people&#x2019;s money had sent him to the road gangs.<br><br> Mississippi was a powerful reminder of those days. The air tasted the same as it had in Alabama, thick and sweet and tending toward rotten. The faces they&#x2019;d driven past in town had brought back some unpleasant memories, too. Hard, lean faces with deep lines and dark pools for eyes. The sort of uncompromising faces a man might expect to see on Judgment Day. They&#x2019;d sure looked that way to Slim Jim when they trooped in from the jury room.<br><br> Well, that felt like a thousand years ago. Now he could buy and sell that fucking jury. And the judge. And his crooked jailers. And the whole goddamned state of Alabama, if he felt like it.<br><br> Well, maybe not the whole state. But he was getting there. This Caddy was bigger and more comfortable than some of the flophouses he&#x2019;d crashed in during the Depression. He had an apartment in an honest-to-goddamned brownstone overlooking Central Park back in New York, and a house designed by some faggot architect overlooking the beach at Santa Monica, out in L.A. He had stocks and bonds and a big wad of folding money he liked to carry in his new buffalo-hide wallet&#x2014;just so&#x2019;s he could pull it out and snap the crisp new bills between his fingers when he needed to remind himself that he wasn&#x2019;t dreaming.<br><br> Hell, he was so rich now that when those C-notes lost their snap, he could give them away and get some new ones.<br><br> Not that he ever did, of course. Ms. O&#x2019;Brien would kill him. And she was more than capable of it. No doubt about that.<br><br> She&#x2019;d insisted that he pick up the Santa Monica house as a long-term investment, too, even though he thought it was kind of down-market, given his newly acquired status.<br><br> &#x201c;You can stay at the Ambassador if you don&#x2019;t like rubbing shoulders with your old cell mates down on the piers,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;Believe me, Santa Monica will come back, and you need to diversify your asset base. Waterfront property is always a sure bet.&#x201d;<br><br> Yes, indeed, and Slim Jim was fond of sure bets. After all, they&#x2019;d made him richer than God. They&#x2019;d also delivered him a conga line of horny babes, a small army of his own hired muscle, and the slightly scary Ms. O&#x2019;Brien.<br><br> Thinking about the slightly scary Ms. O&#x2019;Brien sitting next to him there in the Caddy, however, led naturally to thinking about the slightly scary Ms. O&#x2019;Brien sliding her body over his in a king-sized hotel bed. But that was a dangerous line of thought, he knew. Because Ms. O&#x2019;Brien wasn&#x2019;t inclined to get anywhere near a bed with Slim Jim Davidson, naked or not.<br><br> He&#x2019;d tried feeling her up once, and she&#x2019;d nearly broken his arm for it. She&#x2019;d snapped an excruciating wristlock on him without even breaking a sweat, no doubt a party trick she&#x2019;d picked up back when she was a captain in the Eighty-second MEU. And she&#x2019;d kept him locked up, gasping for breath and nearly fainting away, while she explained to him the facts of life:<br><br> One, she was his employee, not his girlfriend.<br><br> Two, she would be his employee only for as long as she needed to be, and she would never be his girlfriend.<br><br> Three, she could kick his scrawny ass black and blue without bothering to lace up her boots.<br><br> And four, she . . .<br><br> &#x201c;Mr. Davidson?&#x201d;<br><br> Slim Jim jumped, feeling guilty and worried that she might have figured out what he was thinking. But no, luckily she was just dragging him out of his slightly bored daze.<br><br> &#x201c;Elvis has left the cemetery,&#x201d; she announced. She said it in a singsong way, and it seemed to amuse her more than it should have. But Slim Jim had given up trying to figure her out.<br><br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go over it one last time, just to be sure,&#x201d; she said, pulling out a flexipad.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, please,&#x201d; he begged. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not.&#x201d;<br><br> O&#x2019;Brien ignored him, and his shades suddenly flickered into life. Windows opened up on the lenses and seemed to float in the air in front of him. Some carried photographs of the boy they&#x2019;d just seen. Others were full of words. Small words in large type. She&#x2019;d learned not to burden him with too much text.<br><br> Bitch thinks she&#x2019;s so goddamned smart . . .<br><br> Slim Jim sighed, and read through the briefing notes again. Some of his reluctance was for show, though. He never really got tired of the amazing gadgets these guys had brought with them.<br><br> &#x201c;Elvis Aaron Presley, age eight and a half. Mother&#x2019;s name, Gladys. Father&#x2019;s name, Vernon,&#x201d; he recited. &#x201c;Dead brother, Jesse. Attends school at East Tupelo Consolidated. Father jailed for fraud. Asshole tried to ink a four-dollar check into forty . . .&#x201d;<br><br> O&#x2019;Brien shot him a warning look, but he hid behind the shades, pretending he couldn&#x2019;t see her.<br><br> &#x201c;Daddy&#x2019;s out now, away in Como, Mississippi, building a POW camp for the government. Mama takes in sewing when she can get it. Local yokels call &#x2019;em white trash behind their backs . . .&#x201d;<br><br> Slim Jim laughed out loud, glancing out across the ragged fields of corn and soybean that stretched between the cemetery and the edge of the town. &#x201c;Ha! There&#x2019;s a fucking pot calling a kettle black if I ever&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The notes, Mr. Davidson. Just review the notes,&#x201d; said O&#x2019;Brien.<br><br> Slim Jim returned to the readout for what felt like the hundredth time. He&#x2019;d heard about some big-time grifters who worked like this. Getting so far inside the heads of their marks that they knew what was going on in there before the chumps realized it themselves. He could sort of see the point.<br><br> O&#x2019;Brien had helped him close some amazing deals these last few months. But damn, it was hard work. Nevertheless, he plowed on, reciting most of the notes from memory even though the words still hung there in front of him.<br><br> &#x201c;Gladys drinks in private. She finds her comfort in the church. Her first love was dance, her second music. But she&#x2019;s kind of a fat bitch now so . . . Sorry! Sorry . . . She gets around in bare feet and old socks so her kid can have shoes. Elvis, he&#x2019;s aware of his family&#x2019;s low standing. It eats him up and he wants to rescue them. It always tickles him when his mama says she&#x2019;s proud of him.&#x201d;<br><br> In spite of himself, Slim Jim couldn&#x2019;t help but warm to the little prick. They&#x2019;d listened to his music all the way down here, and you had to admit, the kid had a gift. Or would have.<br><br> Then again, maybe he wouldn&#x2019;t. If Slim Jim bought him a ticket out of Tupelo now, gave him enough money for a comfortable life, maybe the kid would never sing a song worth a tinker&#x2019;s crap. Not that the thought really bothered him. Those songs were recorded by an Elvis from another time. No, this was all about who was gonna get paid for them.<br><br> Not some asshole called Colonel Tom Parker, you could bet on that.<br><br> Nope. &#x201c;Slim Jim Enterprises&#x201d; would be latching itself on to this particular money tit. And if the kid never became an actual recording star, just because he grew up rich instead of poor, well, who gave a damn? Slim Jim had grown up in a town a lot like this, with a daddy a lot like Vernon. And if some asshole had turned up on their doorstep, offering to buy them out of poverty, Daddy would have been trampled to death by the entire Davidson clan rushing to sign on the dotted line. And to hell with the consequences.<br><br> Slim Jim was only vaguely aware of the deepening dusk as he sat in the Caddy, chanting his way through O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s notes like some kind of mad priest. Yeah, Tupelo is a lot like home. Besides the two main roads in the center of town, every street was a strip of dirt or gravel. Clouds of dust would rise from them in summer. They&#x2019;d turn into rivers of mud during the spring rains. Most folks would have worked the Roosevelt program during the Depression, cutting brush, fixing roads. Most, like Gladys Presley, wouldn&#x2019;t ask for handouts, but would accept what was offered. The men would all be factory workers and sharecroppers.<br><br> Now most of them would be in the army or working in the war industries. Poor but honest, they&#x2019;d think of themselves. Screwed and stupid was how Slim Jim would have put it.<br><br> A guy like Vernon Presley he could understand. He knew the type. He&#x2019;d have had good intentions, but not enough character to see them through. Slim Jim wished they could deal with Vernon rather than Gladys. It was a laydown that they could sneak a signature out of old Vern, just for a crate of beer and a hundred bucks.<br><br> But O&#x2019;Brien had been a real ballbreaker on that particular subject, even more so than usual. There&#x2019;d be no grifting the Presley family. They&#x2019;d get the industry standard percentage, and Slim Jim would take the industry standard cut. It was a shitload of money to be tossing away to a bunch of dumbass crackers, at least to his way of thinking. But she&#x2019;d given him that stone face of hers again, and he&#x2019;d buckled. She was a scary bitch&#x2014;and bottom line, he was rich because of it.<br><br> &#x201c;And then Vernon told Elvis he was responsible for his mama&#x2019;s ill health because of the bad birth . . . ,&#x201d; he continued, only half his mind on the task.<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Brien said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know for sure that that&#x2019;s happened yet, so it&#x2019;s better not to bring it up. But it&#x2019;s supposed to happen around about now, so just keep it in mind.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Right.&#x201d; He nodded. &#x201c;So are we gonna fuck this puppy or what?&#x201d;<br><br> His lawyer rolled her eyes, but she leaned forward to tap on the glass partition that separated them from the driver.<br><br> &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said, raising her voice. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s roll.&#x201d;<br><br> It was a short drive from Priceville Cemetery to East Tupelo, a pissant little rats&#x2019; nest of meandering unpaved streets running down off the Old Saltillo Road. A couple of creeks, two sets of railroad tracks, some open fields, and a whole world of dreams separated the hamlet&#x2019;s beaten-down inhabitants from the good people of Tupelo proper. Slim Jim wasn&#x2019;t bothered none driving into such a place.<br><br> Nor, he noticed, was Ms. O&#x2019;Brien. He figured it was just another one of those things about your dames from the future. Not much seemed to rattle them, unless you tried to cop a feel without being invited.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; she announced.<br><br> She indicated a small wooden frame house, a &#x201c;shotgun shack,&#x201d; they called them. This one stood about a hundred yards up the street they&#x2019;d just entered. Dusk was full upon them now, and the car&#x2019;s headlights lanced through the gloom and the dust and pollen that always seemed to hang in the air, even at this time of year.<br><br> &#x201c;You sure you don&#x2019;t want to do the talking?&#x201d; he asked, suddenly nervous for no good reason. That wasn&#x2019;t like him at all.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Brien assured him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just business. Be sure and treat them with respect.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No buts. You&#x2019;ll nail it. I&#x2019;ve never known such a rolled gold bullshit artist. If you&#x2019;d been born any luckier, you could have been a senator or a televangelist.&#x201d;<br><br> Slim Jim wasn&#x2019;t sure what she meant by that, but she didn&#x2019;t seem to mean it as a compliment.<br><br> His driver pulled over into the gutter. As soon as he stepped out, the smell took him by the throat. Sour sweat. Outdoor toilets. Woodsmoke. Corn bread, grits, and boiled spuds. The smell of his childhood.<br><br> He could tell, without needing to check, that dozens of pairs of eyes had settled on the back of his newly cut, lightweight suit. Some of the bolder folks would have wandered right out onto their verandas&#x2014;an awful fancy name for a thin porch made of raw pine boards, roofed in by scraps of tin, and supported at each corner by sawed-off bits of two-by-...</p><h2>How Institutions Think (Contemporary Issues in the Middle East)</h2><p><p>First published in 1986 Mary Douglasï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122; theory of institutions uses the sociological theories of Emile Durkheim and Ludwig Fleck to determine not only how institutions think, but also the extent to which thinking itself is dependent upon institutions. Different kinds of institutions allow individuals to think different kinds of thoughts and to respond to different emotions. It is just as difficult to explain how individuals come to share the categories of their thought as to explain how they ever manage to sink their private interests for a common good. </p> <p>Douglas forewarns us that institutions do not think independently, nor do they have purposes, nor do they build themselves. As we construct our institutions, we are squeezing each otherï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122;s ideas into a common shape in order to prove their legitimacy by sheer numbers. She admonishes us not to take comfort in the thought that primitives may think through institutions, but moderns decide on important issues individually. Our legitimated institutions make major decisions, and these decisions always involve ethical principles. </p></p><p></p><h2>Midnight Pleasures With a Scoundrel (Scoundrels of St. James, 4)</h2><p>The wildest passion comes under the cover of night in <em>Midnight Pleasures with a Scoundrel</em>, the fourth installment in <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Lorraine Heath&#x2019;s thrilling Scoundrels of St. James romance series.

At about the age of thirteen, she became mistress to the fiftysix-year-old Lord Hunsdon, Henry VIII&#x2019;s reputed son by Mary Boleyn. As Lord Chamberlain, Hunsdon was in charge of the English theatre and would become the patron of the company that performed the Shakespearean plays. Amelia lived with him for a decade, during which time she also had an affair with the playwright Christopher Marlowe. When she became pregnant, Amelia was exiled from court and next surfaces as the mysterious &#x2018;dark lady&#x2019; in Shakespeare&#x2019;s sonnets. At the age of forty-two, she became the first woman to publish a book of original poetry, employing linguistic features resembling the later Shakespearean plays. Amelia died in poverty in 1645.Drawing upon a wealth of documentary evidence, this controversial and provocative book unites Tudor history, feminism, and Shakespeare scholarship to demonstrate that Amelia Bassano was in all the right places and had all the right knowledge, skills, and contacts to have produced the Shakespearean canon.</p><p>John Hudson is a Shakespeare director.

She has won many awards for her work, including a RITA from Romance Writers of America. Visit her website at www.SusanWiggs.com.<em>Bois-Long-sur-Somme, Picardy <br>March 1414</em><br><br>It was her wedding night.<br><br>A breeze from the river teased the flame of a cresset lamp, and the shadows in the room flickered. Having been conducted to the nuptial chamber by a host of besotted castle folk, Lianna stood listening until their bawdy chants faded.<br><br>She gathered a robe about her shoulders and went to sit in a window alcove. Absently tapping her chin with one finger, she listened to the lapping of the river Somme against the stone curtain walls. The dancing, the feasting, the salutes from Chiang's cannons, the endless rounds of toasts to the newly wedded couple, had left her a weary but triumphant bride.<br><br>She considered the marriage her greatest victory. Not because her husband was handsome, which he was, nor because he was wealthy, which he wasn't. Nor even because she had found the mate of her heart. Love and romance, she knew, existed only in the whimsical gesso paintings on her solar walls.<br><br>Still, triumph rang through her veins. Her marriage to Lazare Mondragon, a Frenchman, shielded her from the English noble who was on his way to wed her at the command of Henry, King of England and pretender to the throne of France. Her life hadn't been the same since King Henry had set his sights on Bois-Long, the gateway to the kingdom of France.<br><br>She felt no regret at having defied the English usurper's orders, no shiver of fear when she considered the consequences of her rebellion, because the sovereignty of France was at stake. Besides, a more immediate matter faced her.<br><br>A scratching sounded at the door. She jumped, then calmed herself and glided to answer it. Clutching the doorjamb, the caller sagged drunkenly into the room.<br><br><em>"Nom de Dieu,"</em> Lianna said with mingled amusement and annoyance. "Look at you, Bonne."<br><br>The maid grinned crookedly, her pretty face flushed to ripeness. "Aye, look at me, my lady." Wine-scented breath rushed from her mouth. <em>"Sainte Vierge!</em> That devil Roland, he has torn my best bliaut!" Bonne indicated the gaping garment, her big breasts nearly spilling from the bodice.<br><br>Her red-rimmed eyes widened as Lianna stepped into a pool of light from the cresset lamp. "By the head of St. Denis, you're already prepared for bed!"<br><br>"Somehow, Bonne," Lianna said dryly, "I knew you wouldn't be much help to me tonight."<br><br>The maid stamped a slippered foot; the motion made her lurch. "You should have summoned me."<br><br>"I hadn't the heart to pull you away from..." She tapped her chin, thinking. "Whose lap ornament were you tonight? Ah yes, Roland."<br><br>"My first duty is to you," Bonne said, then hiccuped softly. "Roland would wait a hundred years for me, anyway," she added matter-of-factly. "At least let me do your hair."<br><br>Bonne drew Lianna down to a stool. With the overcautious motions of a drunk, she fetched an ivory comb and freed Lianna's hair from its coif. "Spun by the angels, I always say," she said, pulling the comb through the silvery curtain of straight, fine locks.<br><br>"I'd as soon have it cropped by the hand of man," Lianna said, grimacing as the comb snared in a tangle. "Chiang nearly set my head aflame when we were testing those new charges."<br><br>"Chiang." Bonne spat the name. "You're too much in the company of that odd Chinaman, my lady. I trust him not."<br><br>"You've been listening to the men-at-arms," Lianna chided. "They're jealous because they know Chiang's gunnery can defend Bois-Long better than their swords."<br><br>"I know naught of defending a castle. But I do know of pleasing a man. Tonight you'll play the lady instead of dabbling in warfare like a soldier. Perhaps a woman's pleasures will turn you from a man's pursuits."<br><br>Lianna sat still as Bonne unstopped a bottle of fragrant oil and anointed her, secreting the scent of lilies at her nape and temples, between her breasts and at the backs of her knees. Despite her drunken state, the maid's hand was steady as she imbued Lianna's lips and cheeks with a discreet mist of rouge.<br><br>Bonne stepped back and gasped in admiration. "By St.<br><br>Wilgefort's beard!" She took up a polished-steel mirror and angled it toward Lianna. "You look like a princess."<br><br>Lianna frowned at her image. The pale robe fluttered against her willow-slim form; her hair hung in drifts around her oval-shaped face. Her customary look of arrogance, worn to hide the intrepid dreamer deep inside, made her delicate features seem hard tonight, hard and bloodless.<br><br>"How can you scowl at being so favored?" Bonne demanded.<br><br>Lianna shrugged and eyed her maid's ripe bosom and bold smile. "In sooth, Bonne, you have the looks that turn heads. Besides, an agreeable face doesn't win a kingdom, nor does it endure."<br><br>"Happily for you, your beauty has endured into your twenty-first year, my lady. You look far younger. I was beginning to think your uncle the duke would have to drive you to the altar at sword point. Think you he'll approve of your Lazare?"<br><br>Lianna swallowed. "My uncle of Burgundy will send his spurs spinning into oblivion when he learns what I've done."<br><br>"Aye, I've always thought he wanted better for you."<br><br>Privately Lianna agreed. She'd often wondered why Uncle Jean had never pressed her to wed, but was too content in her spinsterhood to question him. Now King Henry had forced her out of that comfortable state.<br><br>A burst of noise from the hall drifted in through the window, along with a breeze tinged by the smell of the river and the lingering acrid odor of Chiang's fireworks. Bonne put away the mirror. "I'd best leave you to your husband. My lady...you must be biddable and patient with him____"<br><br>Flushing, Lianna raised a hand to forestall her maid. "Don't worry, Bonne." Women's talk made her ill at ease; she had no interest in secrets whispered behind a damsel's hand. She propelled Bonne toward the door. "I daresay I'll survive my wedding night. Go and find your Roland."<br><br>The girl swayed down the narrow spiral of stairs.<br><br>Lianna returned to her solar to ponder that mysterious, much-lauded act that would solidify her marriage to Lazare Mondragon. With a stab of loss, she thought of her mother, long dead of drowning. Dame Irï¿½ne might have guided her this night, might have prepared her to receive her husband.<br><br>Glancing at the gesso mural, Lianna watched the firelight flicker over a detail of a young woman reading to a child from a psalter. Again Lianna searched her memory for her mother but found only a whisper of rose-sweet fragrance, the ghost of a cool hand against her brow, the soft tones of a female voice. She might have told stories to me, Lianna mused.<br><br>Shaking her head, she tossed aside the useless sentiment. She had no place in her life for pretty stories and games. Fate had left her to learn on her own, to approach every task with calculated logic.<br><br>She faced marriage in the same dispassionate manner. When the English king's envoy had arrived three weeks earlier ordering her to marry a baron who styled himself Enguerrand of Longwood, she'd begun a swift, methodical search for an eligible Frenchman who didn't fear her powerful uncle. In Lazare Mondragon, she'd found him. Sufficiently needy to be dazzled by her dowry, and sufficiently greedy to flout the duke, Lazare had proved instantly agreeable. The castle chaplain&#x2014;aging, senile&#x2014;hadn't insisted on a lengthy reading of banns.<br><br>The door swung open. With stiff movements Lianna inclined her shining head. <em>"Mon sire."</em><br><br>Lazare Mondragon stepped inside. He was resplendent in his wedding costume, from the velvet <em>capuchon</em> on his graying head to his narrow pointed shoes. The shimmering cresset flame lit his handsome features&#x2014;a strong nose, angular chin, and dark, deep-set eyes. Taking Lianna's hand, he brushed it with dry lips.<br><br>The brief contact ignited a flicker of trepidation in her. She snuffed it quickly and said, "Is all well in the hall?"<br><br>"My son Gervais and his wife have won the hearts of the castle folk, Gervais with his bold tales and Macee with her pretty singing." Lazare's voice rang with fatherly pride.<br><br>She studied his lined face. The shadowy eyes looked world-weary, the eyes of a stranger she'd met only six days before. He lacked the eagerness of a new bridegroom. She pushed aside the notion. Of course he wouldn't look eager. Lazare was a widower, her senior by twenty-five years. But he was French, and that was enough for Lianna.<br><br>She poured wine into a mazer and handed it to him.<br><br>"Thank you, Belliane," he said absently.<br><br>"Please, Lazare, I do go by my familiar name."<br><br>"Of course. Lianna."<br><br>Smiling, she filled another cup and lifted it. "A toast, to the deliverance of Bois-Long from English hands."<br><br>A frown corrupted the smoothness of Lazare's brow. "That's what you wanted all along, isn't it, Lianna?"<br><br>The bitterness of his tone sparked a flash of understanding in her. Crossing to his side, she laid her hand on his arm. "I never pretended otherwise."<br><br>He shook her off and turned away. "I was quite cheaply bought, was I not?"<br><br>"We were two people in need, you and I. That our marriage answered those needs is no cause for shame." She faced the window and looked out at the beloved, moonlit water meadows surrounding Bois-Long. "We can be well content here, Lazare, united against the English."<br><br>He drank deeply of his wine. "Longwood could arrive any day now, expecting a bride. What will he do when he finds you've already wed?"<br><br>"Pah! He'll turn his cowardly tail back to England."<br><br>"What if he challenges us?"<br><br>"He's probably old and feeble. I have no fear of him."<br><br>"You're not afraid of anything, are you, Lianna?" It was more an accusation than a tribute.<br><br><em>Nom de Dieu,</em> he did not know her at all. Soon enough, no doubt, some loose-tongued castle varlet would tell him of her soul-shattering terror of the water, that childhood nightmare that plagued her yet as an adult.<br><br>"I fear some things. But I won't waste the sentiment on this Baron of Longwood." With distaste she recalled his flowery missive, scented with roses and sealed with a leopard rampant device. "In fact, I look forward to sending him on his way." She touched her chin. "I've been thinking of saluting him with Chiang's new culverin, the one on the pivoting gun carriage...."<br><br>"It's all a damned game to you, isn't it?" Lazare burst out, his eyes flaring. "We court the disfavor of the two most powerful men in all Christendom, yet you talk of cannon charges and fireworks."<br><br>Although dismayed by Lazare's mood, Lianna bit back a retort. "Then let's talk of other things," she said. "It is our wedding night, <em>mon mari."</em><br><br>"I've not forgotten," he muttered, and poured himself another draught of wine.<br><br>She almost smiled at the irony of the situation. Wasn't it the bride who was supposed to be nervous? And yet, while she faced her duty matter-of-factly, Lazare seemed distracted, hesitant.<br><br>"We've bound our lives before God," she said. "Now we must solidify the vow." Dousing a sizzle of apprehension, she went to the heavily draped bed and shrugged out of her robe. Naked, she slipped between the herb-scented linens and leaned back against the figured oak headboard.<br><br>Lazare approached, drew back the drapes, uttered a soft curse, and said, "You're a beautiful young woman."<br><br>Her brow puckered; the statement was not tendered as a compliment.<br><br>Cursing again, he jerked the coverlet up to her neck. "It's time we understood each other, Lianna. I'll be your husband in name only."<br><br>The sting of rejection buried itself in her heart. Ten years without a father, seventeen without a mother, had left scars she'd hoped her marriage would heal. "But I thought&#x2014; Is it King Henry or my uncle? Are you so afraid of them?"<br><br>"No. That has nothing to do with it."<br><br>"Then do you find me lacking?"<br><br>"No! Lianna, leave off your questioning. The fault doesn't lie with you." Lazare's eyes raked her shrouded form. "You are magnificent, with your hair of silk and sweet, soft skin of cream. Were I a poet, I'd write a song solely on the beauty of your silver eyes."<br><br>The tribute stunned and confused her. He laid his hand, dry and cool, upon her cheek. "You've the face of a madonna, the body of a goddess. Any man would move mountains to possess you!"<br><br>The stillness between them drew on. A faint crackle from the fire and the hiss of the ever-shifting river pervaded the chamber.<br><br>Lazare jerked back his hand. "Any man..." He laughed harshly. "Except me. One of the wenches downstairs will have to do as a receptacle for the unslaked lust you inspire."<br><br>Lianna shivered. "Lazare, I don't understand."<br><br>He leaned against a bedpost. "This marriage is one of mutual convenience. No children must come of our union."<br><br>"Bois-Long needs an heir," she said softly. And in her heart she needed a child. Desperately.<br><br>"Bois-Long <em>has</em> an heir," said Lazare. "My son, Gervais."<br><br>A cold hand took hold of her heart and squeezed. "You can't do this to me," she said, clutching the sheets against her as she sat forward in anger. "The chï¿½teau is my ancestral home, defended by my father, Aimery the Warrior, and his kinsmen before him. I won't allow your son to usurp&#x2014;"<br><br>"You have no choice now, Lianna." Lazare smiled. "You thought yourself so clever, marrying in defiance of King Henry's wishes. But you overlooked one matter. I am not a pawn in your ploy for power. I'm a man with a mind of my own and a son who deserves better than I've given him. My life ended when my first wife died, but Gervais's is just beginning."<br><br>"My uncle will arrange an annulment. You and your greedy son will have nothing of Bois-Long."<br><br>Lazare shook his head. "If you let me go, no one will stand in the way of the Englishman who is coming to marry you. Your uncle of Burgundy has been known to treat with King Henry. He may force you to accept the English <em>god-don.</em> Besides, you've no grounds for annulment. We are married in the eyes of God and France."<br><br>"But you yourself have decreed that it is to be a chaste union!"<br><br>"So shall it be." With a smooth movement, Lazare drew a misericorde from his baldric. Shocked by the dull glint of the pointed blade, Lianna leapt from the bed, shielding herself with the coverlet. Lazare chuckled. "Don't worry, wife, I'll not add murder to my offenses." Still smiling, he pricked his palm with the knife and let a few ruby droplets of blood stain the sheet.<br><br>Lianna bit her lip. In sooth she'd never quite understood where a maid's blood came from; it was destined to remain a mystery still.<br><br>"Now," he said, putting away the misericorde, "it is your word against mine. And I am your lord."<br><br>She clutched the bedclothes tighter. "You used me."<br><br>He nodded. "Just as you used me. I'm tired, Lianna. I'll pass the night on cushions in the wardrobe, so that no one will look askance at us. After a few days I'll be sleeping in the lord's chamber&#x2014;alone."<br><br>"I'll fight you, Lazare. I won't let Gervais have BoisLong."<br><br>Giving her a long, bleak stare, he left the solar. A river breeze snuffed the lamp. Lianna crept back into bed, avoiding t...</p><h2>Baking Artisan Bread: 10 Expert Formulas for Baking Better Bread at Home</h2><p><p>While "bread" once implied a simple, sliced white loaf from the supermarket, consumers have begun to consider the product in a more sophisticated light.

Such experiences are best understood not only through the straightforward acquisition of facts but through a process of discovering where and why conscious understanding and memory fail. Literature, according to Cathy Caruth and others, opens a window on traumatic experience because it teaches readers to listen to what can be told only in indirect and surprising ways. Sociology, film, and political activism can also provide new ways of thinking about and responding to the experience of trauma.</p><p>In <i>Trauma and Memory</i>, a distinguished group of analysts and critics offer a compelling look at what literature and the new approaches of a variety of clinical and theoretical disciplines bring to the understanding of traumatic experience. Combining two highly-acclaimed special issues of <i>American Imago</i> edited by Caruth, this interdisciplinary collection of essays and interviews will be of interest to analysts and critics concerned with the notion of trauma and the problem of interpretation and, more generally, to those interested in current discussions of subjects such as child abuse, AIDS, and the effects of historical atrocities such as the Holocaust.</p><p><b>Contributions by: </b> Georges Bataille, Harold Bloom, Laura Brown, Cathy Caruth, Kai Erikson, Shoshana Felman, Henry Krystal, Claude Lanzmann, Dori Laub, Kevin Newmark, Onno van der Hart, and Bessel van der Kolk. <b>Interviews with: </b> Robert Jay Lifton, Gregg Bordowitz, Douglas Crimp, and Laura Pinsky</p></p><p><p><b>Cathy Caruth </b> is associate professor of English at Yale University.

The combination of theoretical articles about trauma with interviews about its ongoing effects is a particular strength&#x2015;and a particularly appropriate approach when the topic itself is silence or testimony about trauma. The book will be of great interest to those in the psychoanalytic community interested in this kind of interdisciplinary work."</p> (Alan Bass, Ph.D., Psychoanalyst)<br><br><p>"The most thought-provoking book I have read this year is probably Cathy Caruth's anthology <i>Trauma: Explorations in Memory</i>. It's a 1995 collection of essays by a range of authors from the fields of psychoanalysis and literary and cultural criticism, including the film-maker Claude Lanzmann (Shoah). The frequently mechanical and lifeless nature of traumatised discourse, the question of how you listen and communicate, and the possible moral obligation to resist understanding the perpetrators are some of the themes, but there are others, too, as relevant today as they were then."</p> (Sigrid Rausing <i>New Statesman</i>)</p><h2>Orthopedic &amp; Athletic Injury Examination Handbook</h2><p><ul><br> <li>Covers procedures for over <strong>185 special, neurological, ligamentous,</strong> and <strong>range of</strong> <strong>motion tests</strong>.</li><br> <li>Features <strong>unique palpation photographs</strong> with anatomical overlays to identify the underlying structure. </li><br> <li>Provides precisely illustrated, <strong>step-by-step instructions</strong> for <strong>the correct position of patient </strong>and <strong>examiner, the evaluative procedure, positive test results,</strong> and <strong>implications.</strong> </li><br> <li>Accesses the reliability of each test with grades that show the level of support from the available evidence.</li><br> <li>Includes <strong>tables of bony landmarks,</strong> and other useful aids for identifying postural disorders.</li><br> <li>Illustrates proper <strong>measuring techniques</strong></li><br></ul></p><p></p><h2>Human Rights: Politics and Practice</h2><p><em>Human Rights: Politics and Practice</em> is the most complete, most topical, and most student-friendly introduction to human rights.

This primer describes how stereoelectronic effects control this behavior. It is the only concise text on this topic at the undergraduate level. This is an important subject area and the comprehensive yet concise coverage in this book shows students how to build up a powerful but simple way of thinking about chemistry.<br></p><p>This series of short texts provides accessible accounts of a range of essential topics in chemistry. Written with the needs of the student in mind, the Oxford Chemistry Primers offer just the right level of detail for undergraduate study, and will be invaluable as a source of material commonly presented in lecture courses yet not adequately covered in existing texts. All the basic principles and facts in a particular area are presented in a clear and straightforward style, to produce concise yet comprehensive accounts of topics covered in both core and specialist courses. Stereoelectronic effects - interactions between electronic orbitals in three dimensions - control the way that molecules are put together and the &#39;rules of engagement&#39; which operate when they meet and react. An understanding of these effects will help the student develop a &#39;feel&#39; for the nature of molecules and their capabilities, which is especially useful when considering reactivity. Although there are a vast numbers of reactions known, these may be grouped into a small number of mechanistic classes, then into a still smaller set of classes of stereoelectronic interaction. Stereoelectronic effects is deliberately non-mathematical in its approach, with reactions illustrated by real examples. It should provide the student with an understanding of fundamental relationships and a powerful but simple approach to thinking about Chemistry.Antony J.

It covers topics left out of most microeconometrics textbooks and omitted from basic introductions to Stata. </p> <p></p> <p>This revised edition has been updated to reflect the new features available in Stata 11 that are useful to microeconomists. Instead of using mfx and the user-written margeff commands, the authors employ the new margins command, emphasizing both marginal effects at the means and average marginal effects. They also replace the xi command with factor variables, which allow you to specify indicator variables and interaction effects. Along with several new examples, this edition presents the new gmm command for generalized method of moments and nonlinear instrumental-variables estimation. In addition, the chapter on maximum likelihood estimation incorporates enhancements made to ml in Stata 11.</p> <p></p> <p>Throughout the book, the authors use simulation methods to illustrate features of the estimators and tests described and provide an in-depth Stata example for each topic discussed. They also show how to use Stata&#x2019;s programming features to implement methods for which Stata does not have a specific command. The unique combination of topics, intuitive introductions to methods, and detailed illustrations of Stata examples make this book an invaluable, hands-on addition to the library of anyone who uses microeconometric methods.</p></p><p>University of California, California, USA Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA</p><h2>Persecution and the Art of Writing</h2><p><p>The essays collected in <i>Persecution and the Art of Writing</i> all deal with one problem&#x2014;the relation between philosophy and politics.

Wade</em> identified abortion as a constitutional right in1973, it still bears stigma--a proverbial scarlet A. Millions of Americans have participated in or benefited from an abortion, but few want to reveal that they have done so. Approximately one in five pregnancies in the US ends in abortion. Why is something so common, which has been legal so long, still a source of shame and secrecy? Why is it so regularly debated by politicians, and so seldom divulged from friend to friend? This book explores the personal stigma that prevents many from sharing their abortion experiences with friends and family in private conversation, and the structural stigma that keeps it that way. <br><br>In public discussion, both proponents and opponents of abortion's legality tend to focus on extraordinary cases. This tendency keeps the national debate polarized and contentious, and keeps our focus on the cases that occur the least. Professor Katie Watson focuses instead on the cases that happen the most, which she calls "ordinary abortion." <em>Scarlet A</em> gives the reflective reader a more accurate impression of what the majority of American abortion practice really looks like. It explains how our silence around private experience has distorted public opinion, and how including both ordinary abortion and abortion ethics could make our public exchanges more fruitful.<br><br>In <em>Scarlet A</em>, Watson wisely and respectfully navigates one of the most divisive topics in contemporary life. This book explains the law of abortion, challenges the toxic politics that make it a public football and private secret, offers tools for more productive private exchanges, and leads the way to a more robust public discussion of abortion ethics. <em>Scarlet A </em>combines storytelling and statistics to bring the story of ordinary abortion out of the shadows, painting a rich, rarely seen picture of how patients and doctors currently think and act, and ultimately inviting readers to tell their own stories and draw their own conclusions.<br><br>The paperback edition includes a new preface by the author addressing new cultural developments in abortion discourse and new legal threats to reproductive rights, and updated statistics throughout.<br></p><p><br><strong>Katie Watson </strong>is an award-winning Associate Professor of Medical Social Sciences, Medical Education, and Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, where she has taught bioethics, medical humanities, and constitutional law to medical students and masters students for fifteen years.

Watson's book is an important contribution to the growing literature on abortion stigma and the moral case for abortion, and its accessible language will make it an excellent text for classrooms and book clubs. Watson's writing style is personal and engaging, making the book a pleasure to read. The ideas it contains are complex and subtle, but the writing is direct and honest." -- Anu Kumar, <em>Conscience</em><p></p><br>"As a guide to the various ways of thinking about abortion, "<em>Scarlet A</em>" is readable and respectful - and therefore, in its own quiet way, revolutionary." --<em>New York Times</em><p></p><br>"The book is a thoughtful and engaging consideration of one of this country's most controversial words: abortion." --<em>The Chicago Tribune</em><p></p><br>"In this refreshingly accessible book Katie Watson, invites readers to a conversation about 'ordinary abortion'-that is, the vast majority of abortions that take place in the U.S. With immense intelligence and sensitivity, and considerable wit, Watson offers new ways to think about this complex issue, and, importantly, urges readers to continue this conversation with their neighbors and friends."-- Carole Joffe, University of California, San Francisco <br><p></p><br>"Watson provides an important perspective of abortion that isn't regularly shared -- that of a 'routine' and commonly performed procedure. She deftly explores why women often have this procedure and yet don't speak of it openly. The more perspectives we explore and the more we open our minds to various ways of looking at this topic the more readily we can come to a meaningful understanding. I would encourage anyone -- regardless of their current view of abortion -- to read this book."-- Louise P. King Harvard Center for Bioethics <br><p></p><br>"At last, a new, important, and powerful effort to improve the national abortion debate: in this book, bioethicist and lawyer Katie Watson initiates a rich conversation about the morality of ordinary legal abortion in the context of unwanted pregnancy. This illuminating book builds on the narratives and vocabulary of women's lived experience in deciding about abortion. It will captivate anyone willing to attend to the complexity and ambiguity of such decisions." -- James F. Childress, University Professor Emeritus, University of Virginia<p></p><br>"Katie Watson is not afraid to acknowledge the moral complexities of abortion, even as she affirms the legal right to access it. Her writing is lively and clear, but she never underestimates readers' ability to engage in serious moral thinking. Watson will make you think about abortion in new, unforgettable ways." -- Lisa H. Harris, University of Michigan<p></p><br>"<em>Scarlet A</em> is written in a clear, engaging, and accessible style. While it was written and marketed with a general audience in mind, bioethics students and scholars alike will find much to appreciate. Watson's interdisciplinary approach makes for an interesting and <br>novel perspective. The emphasis on ordinary abortion is a particularly important innovation for bioethics, which has all too often focused on extraordinary cases. Watson ends the book with a simple charge to her readers: 'Let's keep talking.' I have no doubt that this important <br>book will inspire readers to do just that." --Mara Buchbinder, <em>Hastings Center Report</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Bush Runner: The Adventures of Pierre-Esprit Radisson (Untold Lives Series)</h2><p><p><strong>NOMINATED FOR THE 2020 RBC TAYLOR PRIZE</strong></p><br><p><strong>AS SEEN ON GLOBAL NEWS-TV'S <em>THE MORNING SHOW</em></strong></p><br><br><p><strong>Murderer.

Readers learn of her childhood love of stargazing, the illnesses of her youth, and the struggles she faced as an unmarried woman attempting to earn a living. Expansive, hand-drawn illustrations enhance the text. Rich, starry nighttime spreads alternate with vividly colored scenes on a white background. The text is wonderfully accessible to younger audiences, but 18th-century culture is not directly explained and may need to be discussed with children while reading. Herschel's family's singular dependence on her as their scullery maid, for example, may recall "Cinderella" to the minds of some youngsters or prompt questions about the way Herschel's family treated her. Also note that the focus here is on Herschel's life rather than on what a comet is or why it is a significant find. Pairing this title with materials on comets, stars, and astronomy would provide solid scientific context for the study of space. Herschel and her brother William's foray into telescope building is a highlight of the volume, as it demonstrates the process of learning through scientific experimentation. The use of italicized first-person excerpts from Herschel's recollections works well here.

The cat and the mouse lean backward and try to stop on the slippery wax, which shows their flawless reflections. Sparks shoot from their heels, but it&#x2019;s much too late: the big door looms. The mouse crashes through, leaving a mouse-shaped hole. The cat crashes through, replacing the mouse-shaped hole with a larger, cat-shaped hole. In the living room they race over the back of the couch, across the piano keys (delicate mouse tune, crash of cat chords), along the blue rug. The fleeing mouse snatches a glance over his shoulder, and when he looks forward again he sees the floor lamp coming closer and closer. Impossible to stop&#x2014;at the last moment he splits in half and rejoins himself on the other side. Behind him the rushing cat fails to split in half and crashes into the lamp: his head and body push the brass pole into the shape of a trombone. For a moment the cat hangs sideways there, his stiff legs shaking like the clapper of a bell. Then he pulls free and rushes after the mouse, who turns and darts into a mousehole in the baseboard. The cat crashes into the wall and folds up like an accordion. Slowly he unfolds, emitting accordion music. He lies on the floor with his chin on his upraised paw, one eyebrow lifted high in disgust, the claws of his other forepaw tapping the floorboards. A small piece of plaster drops on his head. He raises an outraged eye. A framed painting falls heavily on his head, which plunges out of sight between his shoulders. The painting shows a green tree with bright red apples. The cat&#x2019;s head struggles to rise, then pops up with the sound of a yanked cork, lifting the picture. Apples fall from the tree and land with a thump on the grass. The cat shudders, winces. A final apple falls. Slowly it rolls toward the frame, drops over the edge, and lands on the cat&#x2019;s head. In the cat&#x2019;s eyes, cash registers ring up NO SALE.<br>The mouse, dressed in a bathrobe and slippers, is sitting in his plump armchair, reading a book. He is tall and slim. His feet rest on a hassock, and a pair of spectacles rest on the end of his long, whiskered nose. Yellow light from a table lamp pours onto the book and dimly illuminates the cozy brown room. On the wall hang a tilted sampler bearing the words HOME SWEET HOME, an oval photograph of the mouse&#x2019;s mother with her gray hair in a bun, and a reproduction of Seurat&#x2019;s <i>Sunday Afternoon</i> in which all the figures are mice. Near the armchair is a bookcase filled with books, with several titles visible: <i>Martin Cheddarwit</i>, Gouda&#x2019;s <i>Faust</i>, <i>The Memoirs of Anthony Edam</i>, <i>A History of the Medicheese</i>, the sonnets of Shakespaw. As the mouse reads his book, he reaches without looking toward a dish on the table. The dish is empty: his fingers tap about inside it. The mouse rises and goes over to the cupboard, which is empty except for a tin box with the word CHEESE on it. He opens the box and turns it upside down. Into his palm drops a single toothpick. He gives it a melancholy look. Shaking his head, he returns to his chair and takes up his book. In a bubble above his head a picture appears: he is seated at a long table covered with a white tablecloth. He is holding a fork upright in one fist and a knife upright in the other. A mouse butler dressed in tails sets before him a piece of cheese the size of a wedding cake.<br>From the mousehole emerges a red telescope. The lens looks to the left, then to the right. A hand issues from the end of the telescope and beckons the mouse forward. The mouse steps from the mousehole, collapses the telescope, and thrusts it into his bathrobe pocket. In the moonlit room he tiptoes carefully, lifting his legs very high, over to the base of the armchair. He dives under the chair and peeks out through the fringe. He emerges from beneath the armchair, slinks over to the couch, and dives under. He peeks out through the fringe. He emerges from beneath the couch and approaches the slightly open kitchen door. He stands flat against the doorjamb, facing the living room, his eyes darting left and right. One leg tiptoes delicately around the jamb. His stretched body snaps after it like a rubber band. In the kitchen he creeps to a moonlit chair, stands pressed against a chair leg, begins to climb. His nose rises over the tabletop: he sees a cream pitcher, a gleaming knife, a looming pepper mill. On a breadboard sits a wedge of cheese. The mouse, hunching his shoulders, tiptoes up to the cheese. From a pocket of his robe he removes a white handkerchief that he ties around his neck. He bends over the cheese, half closing his eyes, as if he were sniffing a flower. With a crashing sound the cat springs onto the table. As he chases the mouse, the tablecloth bunches in waves, the sugar bowl topples, and waterfalls of sugar spill to the floor. An olive from a fallen cocktail glass rolls across the table, knocking into a cup, a saltshaker, a trivet: the objects light up and cause bells to ring, as in a pinball machine. On the floor a brigade of ants is gathering the sugar: one ant catches the falling grains in a bucket, which he dumps into the bucket of a second ant, who dumps the sugar into the bucket of a third ant, all the way across the room, until the last ant dumps it into a waiting truck. The cat chases the mouse over the blue chair back, down the chair legs, across the waxed floor. Both lean backward and try to stop as the big door comes closer and closer.<br>The mouse is sitting in his armchair with his chin in his hand, looking off into the distance with a melancholy expression. He is thoughtful by temperament, and he is distressed at the necessity of interrupting his meditations for the daily search for food. The search is wearying and absurd in itself, but is made unbearable by the presence of the brutish cat. The mouse&#x2019;s disdain for the cat is precise and abundant: he loathes the soft, heavy paws with their hidden hooks, the glinting teeth, the hot, fish-stinking breath. At the same time, he confesses to himself a secret admiration for the cat&#x2019;s coarse energy and simplicity. It appears that the cat has no other aim in life than to catch the mouse. Although the faculty of astonishment is not highly developed in the mouse, he is constantly astonished by the cat&#x2019;s unremitting enmity. This makes the cat dangerous, despite his stupidity, for the mouse recognizes that he himself has long periods when the cat fades entirely from his mind. Moreover, despite the fundamental simplicity of the cat&#x2019;s nature, it remains true that the cat is cunning: he plots tirelessly against the mouse, and his ludicrous wiles require in the mouse an alert attention that he would prefer not to give. The mouse is aware of the temptation of indifference; he must continually exert himself to be wary. He feels that he is exhausting his nerves and harming his spirit by attending to the cat; at the same time, he realizes that his attention is at best imperfect, and that the cat is thinking uninterruptedly, with boundless energy, of him. If only the mouse could stay in his hole, he would be happy, but he cannot stay in his hole, because of the need to find cheese. It is not a situation calculated to produce the peace of mind conducive to contemplation.<br>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½<br>The cat is standing in front of the mousehole with a hammer in one hand and a saw in the other. Beside him rests a pile of yellow boards and a big bag of nails. He begins furiously hammering and sawing, moving across the room in a cloud of dust that conceals him. Suddenly the dust clears and the cat beholds his work: a long, twisting pathway that begins at the mousehole and passes under the couch, over the back of the armchair, across the piano, through the kitchen door, and onto the kitchen table. On the tablecloth, at the end of the pathway, is a large mousetrap on which sits a lump of cheese. The cat tiptoes over to the refrigerator, vanishes behind it, and slyly thrusts out his head: his eyes dart left and right. There is the sound of a bicycle bell: <i>ring ring</i>. A moment later the mouse appears, pedaling fiercely. He speeds from the end of the pathway onto the table. As he screeches to a stop, the round wheels stretch out of shape and then become round again. The mouse is wearing riding goggles, a riding cap, and gloves. He leans his bicycle against the sugar bowl, steps over to the mousetrap, and looks at it with interest. He steps onto the mousetrap, sits down on the brass bar, and puts on a white bib. From a pocket of his leather jacket he removes a knife and fork. He eats the cheese swiftly. After his meal, he replaces the knife and fork in his pocket and begins to play on the mousetrap. He swings on a high bar, hangs upside down by his legs, walks the parallel bars, performs gymnastic stunts. Then he climbs onto his bicycle and disappears along the pathway, ringing his bell. The cat emerges from behind the refrigerator and springs onto the table beside the mousetrap. He frowns down at the trap. From the top of his head he plucks a single hair: it comes loose with the sound of a snapping violin string. Slowly he lowers the hair toward the mousetrap. The hair touches the spring. The mousetrap remains motionless. He presses the spring with a spoon. The mousetrap remains motionless. He bangs the spring with a sledgehammer. The mousetrap remains motionless. He looks at the trap with rage. Cautiously he reaches out a single toe. The mousetrap springs shut with the sound of a slammed iron door. The cat hops about the table holding his trapped foot as the toe swells to the size of a lightbulb, bright red.<br>The cat enters on the left, disguised as a mouse. He is wearing a blond wig, a nose mask, and a tight black dress slit to the thigh. He has high and very round breasts, a tiny waist, and round, rolling hips. His lips are bright red, and his black lashes are so tightly curled that when he blinks his eyes the lashes roll out and snap back like window shades. He walks slowly and seductively, resting one hand on a hip and one hand on his blond hair. The mouse is standing in the mousehole, leaning against one side with his hands in his pockets. His eyes protrude from their sockets in the shape of telescopes. In the lens of each telescope is a thumping heart. Slowly, as if mesmerized, the mouse sleepwalks into the room. The cat places a needle on a record, and rumba music begins to play. The cat dances with his hands clasped behind his neck, thrusting out each hip, fluttering his long lashes, turning to face the other way: in the tight black dress, his twitching backside is shaped like the ace of spades. The mouse faces the cat and begins to dance. They stride back and forth across the room, wriggling and kicking in step. As they dance, the cat&#x2019;s wig comes loose, revealing one cat ear. The cat dances over to a bearskin rug and lies down on his side. He closes his long-lashed eyes and purses his red, red lips. The mouse steps up to the cat. He reaches into his pocket, removes a cigar, and places it between the big red lips. The cat&#x2019;s eyes open. They look down at the cigar, look up, and look down again. The cat removes the cigar and stares at it. The cigar explodes. When the smoke clears, the cat&#x2019;s face is black. He gives a strained, very white smile. Many small lines appear in his teeth. The teeth crack into little pieces and fall out.<br>The cat is lying on his back in his basket in the kitchen. His hands are clasped behind his head, his left knee is raised, and his right ankle rests sideways on the raised knee. He is filled with rage at the thought of the mouse, who he knows despises him. He would like to tear the mouse to pieces, to roast him over a fire, to plunge him into a pan of burning butter. He understands that his rage is not the rage of hunger and he wonders whether the mouse himself is responsible for evoking this savagery, which burns in his chest like indigestion. He despises the mouse's physical delicacy, his weak arms thin as the teeth of combs, his frail, crushable skull, his fondness for books and solitude. At the same time, he is irritably aware that he admires the mouse's elegance, his air of culture and languor, his easy self-assurance. Why is he always reading? In a sense, the mouse intimidates the cat: in his presence, the cat feels clumsy and foolish. He thinks obsessively about the mouse and suspects with rage that the mouse frequently does not think about him at all, there in his brown room. If the mouse were less indifferent, would he burn with such hatred? Might they learn to live peacefully together in the same house? Would he be released from this pain of outrage in his heart?<br>The mouse is standing at his workbench, curling the eyelashes of a mechanical cat. Her long black hair is shiny as licorice; her lips look like licked candy. She is wearing a tight red dress, black fishnet stockings, and red high heels. The mouse stands the mechanical cat on her feet, unzips the back of her dress, and winds a big key. He zips up the dress and aims her toward the mousehole. In the living room, the mechanical cat struts slowly back and forth; her pointy breasts stick out like party hats. The cat&#x2019;s head rises over the back of the armchair. In his eyes appear hearts pierced by arrows. He slithers over the chair and slides along the floor like honey. When he reaches the strutting cat, he glides to an upright position and stands mooning at her. His heard is thumping so hard that it pushes out the skin of his chest with each beat. The cat reaches into a pocket and removes a straw boater, which he places on his head at a rakish angle. He fastens at his throat a large polka-dot bow tie. He becomes aware of a ticking sound. He removes from his pocket a round yellow watch, places it against his hear, frowns, and returns it to his pocket. He bends close to the face of the cat and sees in each of her eyes a shiny round black bomb with a burning fuse. The cat turns to the audience and then back to the dangerous eyes. The mechanical cat blows up. When the smoke clears, the cat&#x2019;s fur hangs from him in tatters, revealing his pink flesh and a pair of polka-dot boxed shorts.<br>Outside the mousehole, the cat is winding up a mouse that exactly resembles the real mouse. The mechanical mouse is wearing a bathrobe and slippers, stands with hands in pockets, and has a pair of eyeglasses perched at the end of its nose. The cat lifts open the top of the mouse&#x2019;s head, which is attached in the manner of a hinged lid. He inserts a sizzling red stick of dynamite and closes the lid. He sets the mouse in front of the hole and watches as it vanishes through the arched opening. Inside, the mouse is sitting in his chair, reading a book. He does not raise his eyes to the visitor, who glides over with its hands in its pockets. Still reading, the mouse reaches out and lifts open the head of his double. He removes the sizzling dynamite, thrusts it into a cake, and inserts the cake into the mouse&#x2019;s head. He turns the mechanical mouse around and continues reading as it walks out through the arch. The cat is squatting beside the hole with his eyes shut and his fingers pressed in his ears. He opens his eyes and sees the mouse. His eyebrows rise. He snatches up the mouse, opens its head, and lifts out a thickly frosted cake that says HAPPY BIRTHDAY. In the center of the cake is a sizzling red stick of dynamite. The cat&#x2019;s fur leaps up.

Shaara was born into a family of Italian immigrants in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He grew up in Tallahassee, Florida, and graduated from Florida State University. He lives in Gettysburg.Introduction<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the summer of 1964, a twelve-year-old boy followed his father across a mile of open grassy fields that separated the Union and Confederate lines at Gettysburg. They walked in the footsteps of the men who crossed this same ground on July 3, 1863, Confederate soldiers who made one of the most tragic attacks in our history. Today, we know that event as &#x201c;Pickett&#x2019;s Charge.&#x201d; As they stepped through the tall grass, the father told the boy the story of what had happened there, who those men were, why they made this extraordinary attack. The father often told stories to the boy, usually about things the boy knew something about: science fiction, sports. But this was different; this was about history.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the father led his son up and over the low stone wall that marked the position of the Union front line, the father told more of the story. He told the boy about two men, best friends, Lewis Armistead and Winfield Hancock, who had chosen to part ways before the war, each one fighting for something very different, yet each one fighting for what he believed in. But on this day in 1863, the two men would come together again, Armistead leading his men across this field straight into Hancock&#x2019;s guns. The story captured the boy, because the father told it as though he were there, could see it, could hear the guns, and he told the story with the passion the father brought to all his stories. But then the father was silent. The boy saw now that the father&#x2019;s attention had been captured by a low squat stone marker, against which lay a single miniature Confederate flag. In the silence, the boy read the inscription on the marker, which noted the place where Confederate general Lewis Armistead had fallen on that July day in 1863. Then the boy realized that his father was crying.<br> &nbsp;<br> That boy was me. My father, Michael Shaara, was so inspired by the experience of walking the ground at Gettysburg that he spent the next seven years writing a novel about what happened there. That novel, published in 1974, was titled The Killer Angels.<br> &nbsp;<br> In my father&#x2019;s lifetime, The Killer Angels was never a particularly successful book. That may sound odd, considering that in 1975 the book was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. But the book made very little impact, except on those who studied the American Civil War or those in some branches of the military, who had begun to use the book as a guide to understanding the tactics and leadership abilities of the men who were so pivotal to the story. My father went on to write more books, more short stories, none of them having anything to do with history or the American Civil War. Until the end of his life, he never saw any of his books become best sellers and never saw the creation of a motion picture based on his work. The Killer Angels had become something of a sad footnote for him, a truly marvelous award-winning book that had failed to find the audience even he felt it deserved.<br> &nbsp;<br> Michael Shaara died in 1988, believing he had failed to do the one thing that meant more to him than anything else in his forty-year career as a writer. He believed he had failed to leave something behind, something for which he would be remembered. He had failed to leave a legacy.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was wrong.<br> &nbsp;<br> What followed over the next several years was an amazing series of circumstances that changed my life and cemented my father&#x2019;s reputation and legacy for all time. It began with Ken Burns&#x2019;s PBS series The Civil War, which seemed to wake the American people to renewed interest in that era of our history. Two years later, Ted Turner took an enormous chance and in 1992 financed the production of a major motion picture that was based on my father&#x2019;s book. It was called Gettysburg. In October 1993, the release of the film helped propel The Killer Angels to number one on the New York Times Best Seller List, the first time any of my father&#x2019;s books had received such significant recognition. Five years after his death, his legacy was alive and well.<br> &nbsp;<br> My father had proven that an audience for this kind of story did in fact exist. And so, the son has followed the father. As a result, The Killer Angels is now the centerpiece of a trilogy of novels, something that still amazes me and would have absolutely floored my father.<br> &nbsp;<br> With every book I&#x2019;ve done, the research is the energy behind the story, and the energy behind the research has come from walking in the footsteps of the characters. Often those footsteps are difficult to find. A great many sites from the American Revolution and the Civil War have simply disappeared, swallowed up by time and by the need for Americans to expand and modernize their world. But special places remain, and over the past century, movements have begun to protect that ground from obliteration, to preserve at least some tangible part of our past. Museums are well and good, and safekeeping the artifacts of an earlier time may teach us much about the people who gave us our world. But museums are not the ground, just as a zoo is not the jungle.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hallowed ground&#x201d; is a phrase that is often tossed off as something of a clichï¿½, but those who would lightly regard Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s description of Gettysburg are missing the point. Diaries, letters, memoirs, and even photographs have little resonance if we cannot see where an event occurred. If we erase the ground, the hillsides and valleys, the creek beds and rivers, the trench lines and earthworks, then we lose the spirit of our history. We lose the ability to walk in the footsteps, to see what the world looked like to those people who changed our history. No writer can give that to us with as much poignancy as we will find when we walk that ground and see it for ourselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book may not resemble any battlefield guidebook you have ever seen before. That&#x2019;s the point. My attempt here is to paint a portrait of ten specific sites that offer the best interpretation and experience to the visitor, who may not already know every tidbit of historical detail of what happened there. In other words, this book is intended not for the academic historian, but for the curious, those who might have time to stop along the road and visit a battlefield they otherwise might have passed by. The chapters are arranged chronologically, so as to offer some flow to the history of the entire war. If you have some knowledge of the events, if you are something of a Civil War &#x201c;buff,&#x201d; then perhaps this book will encourage you to visit a site you may not have seen before. It may also inspire you to argue with some of my conclusions. Unlike the historian, who has to abide by certain restrictive rules as to his commentary, I offer a few interpretations that some of you may not agree with. As it should be.<br> &nbsp;<br> I could have included several more chapters, gone over several more valuable fields, but I wanted to keep this somewhat compact. If you wonder why certain battlefields were left out (and some of you will most certainly wonder), it is not my intention to dismiss or ignore any park where history is well preserved. Examples not included in this book will surprise (and annoy) some: Manassas, Stone&#x2019;s River, Pea Ridge, Fort Donelson, Andersonville, Fort Sumter, among many others. My choices are meant to carry you through some of the most poignant events of our history, by taking you to magnificent places where, if you visit, you will take away something enormously valuable from the experience.<br> &nbsp;<br> When this book is published, I am making a significant financial contribution to a good many of the battlefield preservation groups whose responsibility it is to preserve and protect these invaluable sites. Those contributions will continue to be made, from a percentage of the sales of this book, for as long as anyone buys it. I respect passion and dedication to a cause, and the people who give so much of themselves to the preservation of these critical historical sites must be supported. &#x201c;Causes&#x201d; stare us in the face from every direction, and most of us are bombarded by requests for money: in the mail, in our offices, on television, in our e-mail. If you agree with me about the value of preserving the shrinking and threatened historical sites in this country, then I hope you will respond appropriately. Regardless, the purpose of this book is to show you what happened there, why it was important, and how you can experience some part of that yourself. In the end, I&#x2019;m simply hoping that this book may inspire more parents to lead their children across some extraordinary piece of ground. Perhaps their lives will be changed as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jeff Shaara<br> April 2006</p><h2>We Are Not Yet Equal: Understanding Our Racial Divide</h2><p><p>Carol Anderson's <i>White Rage </i>took the world by storm, landing on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list and best book of the year lists from <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Boston Globe</i>, and <i>Chicago Review of Books.</i> It launched her as an in-demand commentator on contemporary race issues for national print and television media and garnered her an invitation to speak to the Democratic Congressional Caucus. This compelling young adult adaptation brings her ideas to a new audience. </p><p>When America achieves milestones of progress toward full and equal black participation in democracy, the systemic response is a consistent racist backlash that rolls back those wins. We Are Not Yet Equal examines five of these moments: The end of the Civil War and Reconstruction was greeted with Jim Crow laws; the promise of new opportunities in the North during the Great Migration was limited when blacks were physically blocked from moving away from the South; the Supreme Court's landmark 1954 <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision was met with the shutting down of public schools throughout the South; the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 led to laws that disenfranchised millions of African American voters and a War on Drugs that disproportionally targeted blacks; and the election of President Obama led to an outburst of violence including the death of black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri as well as the election of Donald Trump.</p><p>This YA adaptation will be written in an approachable narrative style that provides teen readers with additional context to these historic moments, photographs and archival images, and additional backmatter and resources for teens.</p></p><p><p><b>Carol Anderson </b>is the Charles Howard Candler Professor and Chair of African American Studies at Emory University.

When Delilah&#x2019;s father filled in her name in the Hebrew Academy day school application form, the rabbi/administrator assumed it was a mistake, a feeble attempt on the part of some clueless, nonreligious Jew to find a Hebrew equivalent for Delia, or Dorothy. &#x201c;You are aware, Mr. Goldgrab, that in the Bible, Delilah seduced Samson and is considered a wicked whore by our sages?&#x201d; he pointed out as gently as he could.</p><p>&#x201c;Well now, you don&#x2019;t say?&#x201d; Delilah&#x2019;s father drawled, his six-foot two-inch frame towering over the little man, who nervously clutched his skullcap. &#x201c;Just so happens it was my mother&#x2019;s name.&#x201d; </p><p>Our first meeting with Delilah was in second grade out on the punch ball fields of the Hebrew Academy of Cedar Heights on Long Island. Punch ball was a Jewish girl&#x2019;s baseball without the bat. You just made the hardest fist you could and wham! &#x2013; started to run. When you hit that ball, you took out all your anger, all your angst, all your frustration. You ran and ran and ran and ran, hoping you&#x2019;d hit it hard enough so that no one could catch it or you, and send you back to first base &#x2013;or worse- throw you out of the game altogether.</p><p>The privilege of hitting the punchball was not to be taken for granted. Each recess, teams were picked anew by captains, who were, by mutual agreement, the prettiest and richest girls in the class. Everyone who wanted to play lined up and just waited for the magic summons. And as in life, some girls&#x2014;like rich, snobby Hadassah Mittelman&#x2014;were always the captains, and some girls, like me, were never asked to play. Never. </p><p>We knew who we were and finally slipped away. But there were others- like Delilah- that sometimes made it in. Girls like her always had it the hardest. To <em>almost </em>make it was a far crueler fate that to be permanently relieved of hope.</p><p>The world was a simple place back then, neatly divided between those of us who got the little blue admission cards in the mail at the start of each new term because our parents had paid the full tuition; and those who got them at the last minute, only after much parental groveling and pleading had pried them from the tightfisted grip of the merciless rabbi/administrator in charge. It was a world divided between those who had cashmere sweaters and indulgent fathers who dropped them off at school in their big cars because they lived in even more upscale neighborhoods further out on the Island and those who shivered in scratchy wool on public buses coming from the opposite direction. </p><p>Delilah took the bus, but she also had a cashmere sweater, the most glorious color pink, that seemed to float around her shoulders like angel hair. Rumor had it that her mother had actually knitted it for her, from scratch; a rumor which cruelly denied her the status conferred by ownership.</p><p>This was no doubt true. Mrs. Goldgrab was a woman of scary heaviness, with bad skin and glasses with rhinestone frames that made her eyes contract into hard, river stones. She worked full-time in some low-level office job that computers have permanently wiped off the employment map, and in her spare time was a seething cauldron of unfulfilled social ambitions, thwarted at every turn by impassable roadblocks. One of the largest was her husband: a tall, lanky man with a shocking Texas accent who worked as a mechanic in a local car repair shop. If anyone ever ran into him in his uniform and mentioned it, Delilah was mortified. Over the years, she adopted the same attitude towards him as her mother: he was something she had to put up with, but he wasn&#x2019;t an asset.</p><p>From the beginning, Mrs. Goldgrab had plans for Delilah. Big plans. She wanted her to be popular with the right girls. To be invited to their birthday parties. She hoped to be able to drop her off at Tudor mansions in Woodmere, and be casually invited in for coffee, where she would chit chat with the mothers who wore pearls and Anne Taylor suits even on weekends, women who existed&#x2014;along with the longed-for invitations-- only in her lower middle-class imagination. Even Hadassah&#x2019;s mother wore jeans on weekends. And no one wanted to chit chat with Mrs. Goldgrab, not even her husband.</p><p>We always envied Delilah that sweater&#x2014;to this day. Except that now we understand that it had meant nothing to her. What she had wanted was a store-bought sweater, the kind that Hadassah Mittelman wore. In fact, she wanted to be Hadassah Mittelman, the Rabbi&#x2019;s beautiful daughter who lived in a house which had a full suit of armor standing in her hallway, guarding the grand staircase upstairs to her designer bedroom, with its ruffled canopy bed. She didn&#x2019;t want to visit that house. She wanted to move in. Maybe we all did in those days. The difference was, that Delilah never got over it. </p><p>So before you judge her for the horrible things she did, please try to remember this: all Delilah Goldgrab Levi ever really wanted was to be included when they called out the names of those who were allowed to play.</p></p><h2>The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service Book Three Omnibus (Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service Omnibus)</h2><p>Some manga offer you stories about zombies...others, robots...others, otaku--but only <i>The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service</i> would offer you a story about a zombie robot otaku!

Despite several setbacks and one apparent catastrophe, his life was buoyed by the influence of Eleanor, who was not only a wife but an adviser and one of the twentieth century's greatest political reformers. </p><p>Nearly complete before Jenkins's death in January 2003, this volume was finished by historian Richard Neustadt.</p></p><p><b>Roy Jenkins</b> was the author of twenty-one books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Churchill</i> and <i>Gladstone</i>, the latter of which won the Whitbread Prize for Biography. Active in British politics for half a century, he entered the House of Commons as a Labour member in 1948 and subsequently served as minister of aviation, home secretary, and chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1977&#x2015;81 he was president of the European Commission. In 1987 he became chancellor of Oxford University and took his seat in the House of Lords as Lord Jenkins of Hill head. He also served as president of the Royal Society of Literature.Distinguished British historian Jenkins (author of the recent bestselling biography Churchill) died in January 2003. He left this brief biography of FDR for Arthur Schlesinger's American Presidents series largely complete. Now published with a conclusion written by another eminent historian, Richard Neustadt, the volume comprises a concise yet coherent and quite reliable summation of Roosevelt's fascinating life and presidency. Jenkins captures FDR in all his contradictions. As the author astutely notes, although a Knickerbocker squire from New York's Hudson Valley-arguably the most Europe-oriented part of the United States-FDR was "peculiarly successful at transcending geography and uniting the continent." Whomever he met, he charmed, be it some simple farmer or Winston Churchill. But the one he charmed before most others, his fifth cousin and spouse, Eleanor Roosevelt, came to view him cynically. She recognized that intermixed with his enormous capacity and willingness to do good, there was a certain self-serving casualness that permitted numerous petty lies perpetrated on friends, allies and family. Elegantly describing FDR's course through a score of personal and political ordeals, Jenkins astutely shows us the man in all his many incarnations: the confident son of privilege who morphed into a wry, young politico on the rise; the startled victim, for whom all things had previously come so easily, hitting the brick wall of polio and fighting back, strenuously leading his broken country out of its two great 20th-century crises: the Great Depression and World War II.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Scriptures and Meditations for Your Best Life Now</h2><p><b>Free yourself from the past, break through into a new mentality, and discover God's great plans for you with these powerful scriptures and meditations for Christians.</b><b><br></b>You don't want to live your life with a 'barely-get-by' mentality -- you want to move beyond ordinary and become the best you can be.

Designed by two sisters-one a doctor, one a lawyer-and drawing on their decades of experience, the five-step Compassion Protocol outlined in <i>A Better Way of Dying</i> offers a simple and effective framework for leaving caretakers concrete, unambiguous, and legally binding instructions about your wishes for your last days. Meant for people in every walk of life-from the elderly, to those in the early stages of mentally degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, to healthy young people planning for an unpredictable future-this book creates space for a discussion we all must have if we wish to ensure comfort and control at the end of our lives..</p><p><b>Jeanne Fitzpatrick</b>, MD, is the coauthor of <i>A Better Way of Dying: How to Make the Best Choices at the End of Life</i>.

He is a lawyer who in 1989 represented a family in the first right-to-die case heard by the US Supreme Court.Bringing together their respective expertise, sisters and debut authors Jean, an emergency room doctor, and Eileen, a practicing lawyer, explain the care pitfalls of death and dying that persist even for those who believe they&#39;re covered by a Living Will. Despite &#34;clearly expressed wishes&#34; to the contrary, many patients close to death are kept alive-using ventilators, antibiotics, intravenous feeding and other methods-by medical personnel (&#34;most doctors still graduate... with basically no training in end-of-life situations&#34;), family members unwilling to accept the inevitable, and nursing homes that benefit financially from keeping Medicaid recipients alive. To clear up ambiguities over end-of-life care, the authors advise putting together a one-page &#34;Contract for Compassionate Care&#34; that &#34;gives you the option to choose a natural death&#34; by delineating what care should be withheld-including hospitalization, antibiotics, usual medications, and hydration/nutrition. The authors outline a practical Compassion Protocol for creating the contract, which prioritizes communication with loved ones and health care professionals. The Fitzpatricks also provide detailed, authoritative and compassionate information on subjects most don&#39;t confront until it&#39;s too late, including hospice care (&#34;an excellent source of... pain control, symptom management, and emotional and spiritual support&#34;), nursing homes, and typical end-of-life scenarios (permanent unconsciousness, Alzheimer&#39;s dementia).

The conference was sponsored by the UUMA's Committee on Antiracism, Anti-oppression, and Multiculturalism. It started with the premise that discussions of race in Unitarian Universalism have too often presupposed a White audience and prioritized the needs, education, and emotions of the White majority. The goal was to reframe Unitarian Universalist anti-oppression work by putting the voices, experiences and learnings of people of color at the center of the conversation. The resulting book, Centering, captures the papers that were presented and the rich dialogue from the conference to share personal stories and address the challenges that religious leaders of color face in exercising power, agency, and authority in a culturally White denomination. Centering explores how racial identity is made both visible and invisible in Unitarian Universalist ministries.</p><p>Rev.

His planning and execution had been perfect, his actions beyond reproach, which was why not a single question would come his way. <br>He was certain of it. <br>The notion had come to him when the vibrations first had coursed through his body two months ago. He'd been out for a late summer hike on Behind the Rocks Trail, following its serpentine path through the maze of red sandstone fins jutting skyward south of town, where the tall slabs of rock sliced the landscape into linear strips of windswept dunes separated by shadowed slot canyons. <br>He knew Utah's politicians long had fed voters the same tired line: the citizens of the state could sell their souls to the petrochemical industry while continuing to attract millions of big&#x2013;spending tourists to southern Utah's incomparable canyon country. In recent years, however, young environmentalists from the Wasatch Front had disputed the politicians' long&#x2013;unquestioned claim. Hoisting the torch of Edward Abbey above their heads, the conservation warriors declared nothing would be left of Utah's stunning red rock country but savaged earth if the oil and gas giants kept mauling the land with their bulldozers, excavators, and graders. <br>The tremors from the thumper truck surged along the ground every few seconds during his hike, pulsing upward through his legs and reverberating in his torso. With each mini&#x2013;earthquake came the same question, over and over again. Could he really a send a seismic wakeup call to every citizen of Utah? Thump. Could he? Thump. <br>He began by purchasing a used laptop from the classifieds and wiping its hard drive clean. After linking the computer to the internet, he conducted his research only through his secret online portal. He bought additional supplies at gun shops and farm and ranch stores in nearby towns, collecting everything his research told him he needed. <br>In the weeks after he initially experienced the vibrations on Back of Beyond Trail, the truck's pulses became a living thing inside him, a thrumming reminder of what he was prepared to do, and why. <br>By early November, the cottonwoods along the Colorado River at the edge of Moab glowed with late autumn gold, the trees resplendent in the slanted fall sunlight. The brilliant yellow leaves snapped free of their branches by the thousands, fluttering to earth in shimmering cascades, on the crisp clear morning the massive thumper truck trundled through town, its passage noted by only a handful of sign&#x2013;waving activists. Turning off the highway twenty miles north of Moab, the truck crawled across public land on a winding two track to Yellow Cat Flat, hard against the northern border of Arches National Park. <br>A few final leaves clung to the skeletal limbs of the cottonwoods along the river when the year's first winter storm drew a bead on southern Utah a week later. He checked the truck's timetable on the O&amp;G Seismic website as the storm bore down, set to bring decreasing temperatures, whipping winds, and icy sleet to canyon country. <br>According to the schedule, when the storm arrived in two days, the truck still would be thumping its way across Yellow Cat Flat, just outside the park. <br>He checked the drill and detonator and tested the timer and battery. He measured out the blasting powder, making sure the portion was exact. <br>The storm crossed into Utah late in the afternoon. Gray clouds gathered over the state as darkness fell, bringing heavy snow to the northern mountains and sleet to the high desert lands in the south. <br>He deleted his online account and powered down the laptop that evening. He drove over the Colorado River bridge after nightfall, slowing to toss the computer into the roiling waters below. <br>Biting gusts of wind and frigid blasts of sleet struck him when he shouldered his pack and set out on foot, clicking on his headlamp and hiking into the empty desert. He wended his way through sagebrush and chamisa, the bluffs and promontories at the heart of Arches National Park looming above him, black against the overcast sky in the midnight darkness. <br>He finished hand&#x2013;drilling the hole in the sandstone arch as the sky lightened with dawn. The arch soared above a meadow of sage and bunch grass, connecting humped ridges of slickrock. He tamped the blasting powder into the drill hole, sank the parallel detonation prongs into the charge mixture, and backed away, unspooling the thin detonator cord as he went. He crouched in a shallow pothole fifty yards from the rock span, plunger in hand. <br>The first thump of the day pulsed through his hiding place at 7:30, right on schedule. A second thump followed from the north a few seconds later, then another, and another. <br>Needles of wind&#x2013;driven sleet gathered on his shoulders as the inexorable beat of the pulses continued. Trembling with anticipation, he wrapped his fingers around the plastic plunger handle, preparing to press it downward. <br>A light tap&#x2013;tap&#x2013;tapping noise reached him&#x2014;the sound of running steps, propelled by the squalling wind. He stiffened and checked his watch. 7:35. He leaned forward, his eyes wide and his heart pounding. <br>She appeared a hundred yards beyond the arch, her blue jacket and black tights silhouetted against the gray clouds. She ran through the swirling sleet with the easy gait of a gazelle, crossing the spine of rock high above the meadow, headed straight for the stone span. <br>He very nearly leapt to his feet and screamed at her to turn back. But that would have meant giving himself away. <br>He had a job to do. He knelt in place, his head ducked. Surely she would stop before venturing onto the arch itself. <br>She slowed and edged down the sloping ridge of stone. Rather than halt, she stepped from the solid rock bluff onto the narrow span. <br>The digital numbers on his watch flicked from 7:35 to 7:36. His timing was critical if his alibi was to hold up. He tightened his fingers around the plunger handle, his breaths coming in constricted gasps. <br>She extended her arms from her sides and placed one foot directly in front of the other, her pace slow and deliberate. She was fifteen feet out on the arch when, finally, he could contain himself no longer. <br>He rose from the depression, revealing himself, convinced the distance and the mist and sleet between them would assure she would not be able to identify his face. He lifted his hand. Surely, having been spotted, she would retreat. <br>But he forgot the plunger, which slipped from his palm. Its handle struck his shoe. The handle did not appear to depress much, if at all. Nevertheless, a sharp concussive crack sounded from the arch. <br>The woman dropped her arms to her sides, her gaze fixed on the narrow span of stone extending through the air before her. <br>The plastic plunger clattered away from his foot as the near end of the span cleaved in two. Dark lines shot like black lightning its entire length. For an instant, the arch maintained its shape, suspended in the sky. Then it fractured into dozens of jagged chunks of stone. <br>"No!" he cried out. <br>Too late. <br>The woman looked up, her eyes finding his the same instant the rock shattered beneath her. She screamed and grabbed at the air with outstretched fingers as she fell with the falling pieces to the meadow five stories below.</p><h2>Bad Luck &amp; Trouble</h2><p>THIS IS BRAND NEW BOOK.WE PROVIDE 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.</p><p>Ex-military cop Jack Reacher is the perfect antihero--tough as nails, but with a brain and a conscience to match.

That night in Illinois was a ten-year anniversary of a different sort, somewhat bittersweet.<br><br> And ten is a nice round number. So I started thinking about my old colleagues. My workmates, my buddies. We had been through a lot together. I started to wonder where they all were now. What were they doing? Were they doing well, or struggling? Were they happy? What did they look like now? Pretty soon I was into full-on nostalgia mode. Ten-year anniversaries can do that to a person. I think we all share those kind of feelings, about high school, or college, or old jobs we've quit, or old towns we've moved away from.<br><br> So I decided to make this year's Jack Reacher book about a reunion. I decided to throw him back among a bunch of old colleagues that he hadn't seen for ten years, people that he loved fiercely and respected deeply. Regular Reacher readers will know that he's a pretty self-confident guy, but I wanted him to wobble just a little this time, to compare his choices with theirs, to measure himself against them.<br><br> The renewed get-together isn't Reacher's own choice, though. And it's not a standard-issue reunion, either. Something very bad has happened, and one of his old team-members from the army contacts him, by an ingenious method (it's hard to track Reacher down). She gives him the bad news, and asks him to do something about it. He says, "Of course I'll do something about it."<br><br> "No," his friend says. "I mean, I want you to put the old unit back together."<br><br> It's an irresistible invitation. Wouldn't we all like to do that, sometimes? <i>--Lee Child</i><br><br> <b>Secrets of the Series: A Q&amp;A with Lee Child</b><br><br> <b>Q:</b> Why do you think readers keep coming back to your novels?<br> <b>A:</b> Two words: Jack Reacher. Reacher is a drifter and a loner with a strong sense of justice. He shows up, he acts, he moves on. He's the type of hero who has a long literary history. Robin Hood, the Lone Ranger, Aragorn from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Jack Reacher--they're all part of the same heroic family. Reacher just ratchets it up a notch. Maybe more than a notch. Why is he so appealing? Most often people say to me it's his sense of justice; he will do the right thing. Even though there is no reward in it for him, even though there is often a high cost to be paid by him, he will always try to do the right thing and people find that reassuring in today&#x2019;s world when not too many people are doing the right thing.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Jack Reacher gets compared to James Bond, Jack Bauer and Jason Bourne, each of whom now has a "face." In a movie, which actor do you think could fill Reacher's shoes?<br> <b>A:</b> That's the toughest question. The thing about Reacher is he's huge; he&#x2019;s 6'5" tall and about 250 pounds. There aren&#x2019;t any actors that size--actors tend to be small. So we aren't going to find a physical facsimile for Reacher because there aren't any. We have to find someone who is capable of looking big on the screen. Many people have said to me a young Clint Eastwood would have been perfect--we need someone like that who has the vibe of a big intimidating man. Hopefully there will be somebody available like that. It's also a question of finding somebody ready to sign up for more than one movie. They want to make a franchise, minimum of three, and that makes it a little bit harder. <br><br> <b>Q:</b> What research is involved in writing one of your stories? <br> <b>A:</b> My research is all kind of backwards. I don't go to the public library for three months and take notes in advance; instead my best research is by remembering and adapting. I read, travel, and talk to people just for the fun of it, filing away these interesting little snippets to the back of my mind and eventually they float to the surface and get used. The problem is, I approach writing the book with the same excitement and impatience that I hope the reader is going to feel about reading it. But even so, I need a certain measure of technical intrigue in the story. There is specific research I have to do as I go along, anything that's a small detail; a car, a gun, a type of bullet. I will check that out at the time. But, that's what I call the detail--the broad stuff is the stuff I already know. <br><br> <strong>Meet Jack Reacher</strong> <table><tbody><tr> <td> <br><i>The Killing Floor</i></td><td> <br><i>Die Trying</i></td><td> <br><i>Tripwire</i></td><td> <br><i>Running Blind</i></td><td> <br><i>Echo Burning</i></td></tr></tbody></table> <br><br> <table><tbody><tr> <td> <br><i>Without Fail</i></td><td> <br><i>Persuader</i></td><td> <br><i>The Enemy</i></td><td> <br><i>One Shot</i></td><td> <br><i>The Hard Way</i></td></tr> </tbody></table><br> <p></p>YOU DO NOT MESS WITH JACK REACHER  One of the world s most enduring and popular fiction charactersï¿½Another sure-fire hit  Daily Mirror September 11th changed Reacher s drifter lifestyle in one practical way.

A haunting tale of lost causes and lost love, The Remains of the Day, winner of the Booker Prize, contains Ishiguro&#39;s now celebrated evocation of life between the wars in a Great English House - within its walls can be heard ever more distinct echoes of the violent upheavals spreading across Europe.</p><p>The novel&#39;s narrator, Stevens, is a perfect English butler who tries to give his narrow existence form and meaning through the self-effacing, almost mystical practice of his profession. In a career that spans the second World War, Stevens is oblivious of the real life that goes on around him -- oblivious, for instance, of the fact that his aristocrat employer is a Nazi sympathizer. Still, there are even larger matters at stake in this heartbreaking, pitch-perfect novel -- namely, Stevens&#39; own ability to allow some bit of life-affirming love into his tightly repressed existence.A tragic, spiritual portrait of a perfect English butler and his reaction to his fading insular world in post-war England. A wonderful, wonderful book.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Tripmaster Monkey: His Fake Book, 1st Vintage Edition</h2><p>Driven by his dream to write and stage an epic stage production of interwoven Chinese novelsWittman Ah Sing, a Chinese-American hippie in the late &#39;60s.</p><p>Maxine Hong Kingston is the daughter of Chinese immigrants who operated a gambling house in the 1940s, when Maxine was born, and then a laundry where Kingston and her brothers and sisters toiled long hours. Kingston graduated with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in 1962 from the University of California at Berkeley, and, in the same year, married actor Earll Kingston, whom she had met in an English course. The couple has one son, Joseph, who was born in 1963. They were active in antiwar activities in Berkeley, but in 1967 the Kingstons headed for Japan to escape the increasing violence and drugs of the antiwar movement. They settled instead in Hawai&#x2018;i, where Kingston took various teaching posts. They returned to California seventeen years later, and Kingston resumed teaching writing at the University of California, Berkeley.<br><br>While in Hawai&#x2018;i, Kingston wrote her first two books. <b>The Woman Warrior</b>, her first book, was published in 1976 and won the National Book Critics Circle Award, making her a literary celebrity at age thirty-six. Her second book, <b>China Men</b>, earned the National Book Award. Still today, both books are widely taught in literature and other classes. Kingston has earned additional awards, including the PEN West Award for Fiction for <b>Tripmaster Monkey</b>, the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature, and the National Humanities Medal, which was conferred by President Clinton, as well as the title &#x201c;Living Treasure of Hawai&#x2018;i&#x201d; bestowed by a Honolulu Buddhist church. Her most recent books include a collection of essays, <b>Hawai</b>&#x2018;<b>i One Summer</b>, and latest novel, <b>The Fifth Book of Peace</b>. Kingston is currently Senior Lecturer Emerita at the University of California, Berkeley.After graduating from Berkeley in English literature, Wittman Ah Sing searches for his niche in the Bay Area of the 1960s. He is a typical product of this time--pot-smoking, free-loving, draft-dodging, unemployed, anti-big business, long-haired, and sandal-shod. But he is also a Chinese-American fighting Chinese stereotypes--and therein lies the book's strength. Unfortunately, the book's great weakness is Wittman Ah Sing himself--a hippie stereotype difficult to feel for because he does not seem real, certainly less real than some of the characters surrounding him. This first novel by the author of The Woman Warrior is thus not entirely successful, but Kingston's wide popularity makes it an essential purchase for most libraries.<br><i>- Kitty Chen Dean, Nassau Coll., Garden City, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Intimate Frontiers: Sex, Gender, and Culture in Old California (Histories of the American Frontier Series)</h2><p><p>This book reveals how powerful undercurrents of sex, gender, and culture helped shape the history of the American frontier from the 1760s to the 1850s. Looking at California under three flags--those of Spain, Mexico, and the United States--Hurtado resurrects daily life in the missions, at mining camps, on overland trails and sea journeys, and in San Francisco. In these settings Hurtado explores courtship, marriage, reproduction, and family life as a way to understand how men and women--whether Native American, Anglo American, Hispanic, Chinese, or of mixed blood--fit into or reshaped the roles and identities set by their race and gender.</p><p>Hurtado introduces two themes in delineating his intimate frontiers. One was a libertine California, and some of its delights were heartily described early in the 1850s: "[Gold] dust was plentier than pleasure, pleasure more enticing than virtue. Fortune was the horse, youth in the saddle, dissipation the track, and desire the spur." Not all the times were good or giddy, and in the tragedy of a teenage domestic who died in a botched abortion or a brutalized Indian woman we see the seamy underside of gender relations on the frontier. The other theme explored is the reaction of citizens who abhorred the loss of moral standards and sought to suppress excess. Their efforts included imposing all the stabilizing customs of whichever society dominated California--during the Hispanic period,arranged marriages and concern for family honor were the norm; among the Anglos, laws regulated prostitution,missionaries railed against vices, and "proper" women were brought in to help "civilize" the frontier.</p></p><p>Histories of the American Frontier seriesExplores the role of sex and gender on California&#39;s multi-cultural frontier under the influences of Spain, Mexico, and the United States.</p><h2>Daughters of Silence (Fear Street, No. 6)</h2><p>Summoning the dark powers of their family to bring back their dead daughters, Angelica and Simon Fear unflinchingly begin an act of black magic that calls for the sacrifice of two innocent girls.</p><p>R.L.

Corporations slash employees by the thousands, and the benefits and pensions once guaranteed by "middle-class" jobs are a thing of the past. </p><p>In <i>Bait and Switch</i>, Barbara Ehrenreich goes back undercover to explore another hidden realm of the economy: the shadowy world of the white-collar unemployed. Armed with the plausible rï¿½sumï¿½ of a professional "in transition," she attempts to land a "middle-class" job. She submits to career coaching, personality testing, and EST-like boot camps, and attends job fairs, networking events, and evangelical job-search ministries. She is proselytized, scammed, lectured, and&#x2015;again and again&#x2015;rejected. </p><p><i>Bait and Switch</i> highlights the people who have done everything right&#x2015;gotten college degrees, developed marketable skills, and built up impressive rï¿½sumï¿½s&#x2015;yet have become repeatedly vulnerable to financial disaster. There are few social supports for these newly disposable workers, Ehrenreich discovers, and little security even for those who have jobs. Worst of all, there is no honest reckoning with the inevitable consequences of the harsh new economy; rather, the jobless are persuaded that they have only themselves to blame. </p><p>Alternately hilarious and tragic, <i>Bait and Switch</i>, like the classic <i>Nickel and Dimed</i>, is a searing exposï¿½ of the cruel new reality in which we all now live.</p></p><p><p> <strong>Questions for Barbara Ehrenreich</strong> </p><p> Through over three decades of journalism and activism and over a dozen books, Barbara Ehrenreich has been one of the most consistent and imaginative chroniclers of class in America, but it was her bestselling 2001 book, <i>Nickel and Dimed</i>, a undercover expose of the day-to-day struggles of the working poor, that has been the most influential work of her career. Now, with <i>Bait and Switch</i>, she has gone undercover again, this time as a middle-aged professional trying to get a white-collar job in corporate America. We asked her a few questions about what she found: </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Your previous book, <i>Nickel and Dimed</i>, became a blockbuster bestseller with a classic "there but for the grace of God go I" liberal message just when the general political mood of the country seemed to be going in a very different direction. Why do you think it struck such a chord? What sorts of reactions have you gotten to it over the past four years? </p><p><strong>Barbara Ehrenreich:</strong> A lot of <i>Nickel and Dimed</i> readers are people who regularly inhabit the low-wage work world, and many of them write to tell me that the book affirmed their experience and made them feel less alone and ignored. Other readers though, are affluent people who write to say I opened their eyes to a world they'd been unaware of. For those people, I think one appealing feature of <i>Nickel and Dimed</i> is that it's a personal narrative that gives them a look at lives lived at the margins of their own. The most gratifying response has been from people who tell me the book inspired them to become activists for things like a living wage or affordable housing. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> At what point did you realize that your new book, <i>Bait and Switch</i>, in which you went undercover again, this time to tell a story of working in corporate America, was instead becoming one of <i>not</i> working in corporate America? Is that the story you expected to tell? </p><p><strong>Ehrenreich:</strong> My initial aim was not "to tell a story of working in corporate America" but to try to understand the human underside of corporate America--the job insecurity, the constant layoffs and downsizings that now occur even in the best of times. I <i>expected</i> to get a job and hence an inside view, but I always knew that that would be very difficult. After about 4-5 months of job searching, I began to get seriously discouraged, but I also came to understand that a fruitless search is in fact a very common experience. After all, today 44 percent of the long-term unemployed are white collar folks--an unusually high percentage. It's their world I entered, and their story that I tell in <i>Bait and Switch</i>. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> For someone with a white-collar career, you didn't have much experience in corporate culture before you attempted to join it for this book. What surprised you the most about what you found? </p><p><strong>Ehrenreich:</strong> What surprised me most, right from day one of my job search, was the surreal nature of the job searching business. For example, everyone, from corporations to career coaches, relies heavily on "personality tests" which have no scientific credibility or predictive value. One test revealed that I have a melancholy and envious nature and, for some reason, was unsuited to be a writer! And what does "personality" have to do with getting the job done, anyway? There's far less emphasis on skills and experience than on whether you have the prescribed upbeat and likeable persona. I kept wondering: Is this any way to run a business? I was also surprised--and disgusted--by the constant victim-blaming you encounter among coaches, at networking events for the unemployed, and in the business advice books. You're constantly told that whatever happens to you is the result of your attitude or even your "thought forms"--not a word about the corporate policies that lead to so much turmoil and misery. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You seemed to make much closer ties with your fellow workers in <i>Nickel and Dimed</i> than you did on the white-collar job hunt. What was different this time? </p><p><strong>Ehrenreich:</strong> You're right--there is a difference. But it's not so much a matter of personalities as it is about two different worlds. There's a lot of camaraderie in the blue-collar world I entered in <i>Nickel and Dimed</i>. People help each other and look out for each other; they laugh together--often at the managers. The white-collar world doesn't encourage camaraderie, far from it. There it's all about competition and fear--of losing one's job, for one thing. Other people are seen as sources of contacts or tips, at best; as competitors or rivals, at worst. And among the unemployed add shame and a sense of personal failure, the constant message that it's all your own fault. All this discourages any solidarity with others or real openness. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> God forbid anyone would come to your book as a guide for finding a white-collar job, but what advice would you give to someone in the shoes you put yourself in: a middle-aged professional woman, in fear of falling irrevocably out of touch with the world of the regularly employed? </p><p><strong>Ehrenreich:</strong> You don't think I'd make a good career coach? OK, but I have three pieces of advice for the middle-aged, middle-class job seeker anyway: </p><p> One, be very careful how you spend your money and time. Since the mid-90s, a whole industry has sprung up to help--or, depending on your point of view, prey upon--white-collar job seekers. The "professionals" in this business are usually entirely unlicensed and unregulated. Also, watch out for events billed as "networking" opportunities that really have another agenda--like recruiting you into expensive coaching or proselytizing you into a particular religion. </p><p> Two, don't count on the internet job sites to find you a job or even an interview. On any of these sites, your resume will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others, and most large companies today don't even bother reading online resumes; they have computer programs scan them for keywords (and you won't know what those keywords are.) </p><p> Three, and most important: stop believing that it's your own fault. That's the first step to recognizing the common problems facing white-collar workers and responding to them. I'd be thrilled if this book, like <i>Nickel and Dimed</i>, also inspires readers to get involved and become active in efforts to make life a little easier for the growing numbers of people who are unemployed, underemployed, or anxiously employed. What could they do? Lobby for universal health insurance that's not tied to a job, for example. Fight for extended unemployment benefits. Raise their voices to complain about corporate tax breaks and subsidies that are justified in terms of "job creation" but often go to companies that are busy laying people off. One major reason job loss is so catastrophic is that we just don't have much of a safety net in this country. That has to change, and who's going to make it change, if not people like those I met in <i>Bait and Switch</i>? I've got a new website, barbaraehrenreich.com, and I'd like to hear from readers--both their stories and their ideas for how to take action. </p> <strong>Classic Ehrenreich</strong> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> <i>Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America</i></td> <td> <br> <i>Fear of Falling: The Inner Life of the Middle Class</i> </td> <td> <br> <i>Blood Rites: Origins and History of the Passions of War</i></td> </tr> </tbody></table>Americans&#x2019; working lives are growing more precarious every day. Corporations slash employees by the thousands, and the benefits and pensions once guaranteed by &#x201c;middle-class&#x201d; jobs are a thing of the past. <br>In <i>Bait and Switch</i>, Barbara Ehrenreich goes back undercover to explore another hidden realm of the economy: the shadowy world of the white-collar unemployed. Armed with the plausible rï¿½sumï¿½ of a professional &#x201c;in transition,&#x201d; she attempts to land a &#x201c;middle-class&#x201d; job. She submits to career coaching, personality testing, and EST-like boot camps, and attends job fairs, networking events, and evangelical job-search ministries. She is proselytized, scammed, lectured, and&#x2014;again and again&#x2014;rejected. <br><i>Bait and Switch</i> highlights the people who have done everything right&#x2014;gotten college degrees, developed marketable skills, and built up impressive rï¿½sumï¿½s&#x2014;yet have become repeatedly vulnerable to financial disaster. There are few social supports for these newly disposable workers, Ehrenreich discovers, and little security even for those who have jobs. Worst of all, there is no honest reckoning with the inevitable consequences of the harsh new economy; rather, the jobless are persuaded that they have only themselves to blame. <br>Alternately hilarious and tragic, <i>Bait and Switch</i>, like the classic <i>Nickel and Dimed</i>, is a searing exposï¿½ of the cruel new reality in which we all now live.</p><h2>Quilts Made Modern: 10 Projects, Keys for Success with Color &amp; Design, From the FunQuilts Studio</h2><p>You&#39;ll love the dramatic results you get with this modern approach to quiltmaking.

The book includes excellent material on design and how to consider all the elements (or layers) of the quilt. The authors offer tips on using fabrics in particular designs. I loved their tip for looking for fabric in your stash at an online retailer to see how the color looks with fabrics you are considering purchasing. The book includes complete instructions for making 10 quilts. What I also found valuable was the discussion on why particular fabric and quilting choices work with each quilt.<br><br>The photography in this quilt book is visually stunning and many of the quilt designs are gorgeous. The emphasis is on color, hue, and scale. The authors' design principles are fully explained in detail. It is quite evident that the authors are quilting and color theory teachers by the way they explain each step so thoroughly from beginning to end in the quilt-making process. An excellent book for a beginner who is not particularly interested in quilts that look like their granny made them, although as an intermediate-level traditional quilter, I appreciated some of the hints and refreshers in techniques and color theory. Many of the quilt designs intrigue me and some may become my projects at some point.<br><br>The Design Notes after each quilt pattern and the three additional color variations per quilt further caught my attention. This book is a classic modern jewel. I was so impressed with it that I bought their Transperancy Quilts book afterwards and was not disappointed. --Donna Keating, July 13, 2012</p><h2>Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained (Collins Classics)</h2><p>Milton&#39;s &#39;Paradise Lost&#39; is a poem of epic proportions that tells of Satan&#39;s attempts to mislead Eve into disobeying God in the Garden of Eden, by eating from the tree of knowledge.

In <i>Paradigm Lost</i>, Ian S. Lustick brings fifty years as an analyst of the Arab-Israeli dispute to bear on this question and offers a provocative explanation of why continued attempts to divide the land will have no more success than would negotiations to establish a one-state solution.</p><p>Basing his argument on the decisiveness of unanticipated consequences, Lustick shows how the combination of Zionism's partially successful Iron Wall strategy for dealing with Arabs, an Israeli political culture saturated with what the author calls "Holocaustia," and the Israel lobby's dominant influence on American policy toward the Arab-Israeli conflict scuttled efforts to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Yet, he demonstrates, it has also unintentionally set the stage for new struggles and "better problems" for both Israel and the Palestinians. Drawing on the history of scientific ideas that once seemed certain but were ultimately discarded, Lustick encourages shifting attention from two-state blueprints that provide no map for realistic action to the democratizing competition that arises when different subgroups, forced to be part of the same polity, redefine their interests and form new alliances to pursue them.</p><p><i>Paradigm Lost</i> argues that negotiations for a two-state solution between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River are doomed and counterproductive. Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs can enjoy the democracy they deserve but only after decades of struggle amid the unintended but powerful consequences of today's one-state reality.</p></p><p>Ian S. Lustick is Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania and holds the Bess W. Heyman Chair. He is author of numerous books, including Trapped in the War on Terror, also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>"<i>Paradigm Lost</i> is an important addition to our understanding of the failure of the Two States Solution. It unpacks how the Iron Wall mentality came to dominate Israeli politics and hindered any serious attempt to reach peace with the Palestinians.mIt is a must read for every Israeli and American interested in going beyond the present impasse."&#x2014;Leila Farsakh, University of Massachusetts</p><br><br><p>"Ian Lustick has written a richly informed and persuasive account of how the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians has become the seemingly dead-end tragedy it is today. This book provides an especially insightful analysis of why Israeli attitudes toward this issue evolved as they did. It is essential reading for anyone concerned about this conflict and hungry for new ways to think about it."&#x2014;Paul R. Pillar, former National Intelligence Officer for the Near East and South Asia</p><br><br><p>"This important new book by one of the country's most thoughtful, insightful, and engaged students of Israel and its conflict with the Palestinians is at once both provocative and persuasive. The book makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the path that brought Israel to the situation it faces today&#x2014;and of what is likely to come next. Meticulously researched and convincingly argued, Paradigm Lost is a must-read for all who are interested in, and care about, Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."&#x2014;Mark Tessler, University of Michigan</p></p><h2>Brown-Eyed Girl: A Novel (The Travis Family, 4)</h2><p><p><b>She&#x2019;s a single woman in the Lone Star state. </b><br><b></b><br><b> </b>Wedding planner Avery Crosslin may be a rising star in Houston society, but she doesn&#x2019;t believe in true love&#x2015;at least not for herself.

The cuts looked raw, untouched by wind or rain, and because of this, they might have seemed as youthful and as innocent as the sentiment itself. A witness lacking literacy would see only the violence of the mason's hand, but surely it is fair to say that the ignorant are not capable of irony. Yet like the house-hound who by scent alone will know a guest's true nature, the uncomprehending witness surrenders nothing when it comes to subtle truths. Accordingly, the savage wounding of the lintel stone's basalt face remained imposing and significant to the unversed, even as the freshness of the carved words gave pause to those who understood them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>There will be peace.</i> Conviction is a fist of stone at the heart of all things. Its form is shaped by sure hands, the detritus quickly swept from view. It is built to withstand, built to defy challenge, and when cornered it fights without honour. There is nothing more terrible than conviction.</p> <p>It was generally held that no one of Azathanai blood could be found within Dracons Hold. Indeed, few of those weary-eyed creatures from beyond Bareth Solitude ever visited the city-state of Kurald Galain, except as stone-cutters and builders of edifices, summoned to some task or venture. But the Hold's lord was not a man to welcome questions in matters of personal inclination. If by an Azathanai hand ambivalent words were carved above the threshold to the Hold's Great House - as if to announce a new age with either a promise or a threat - that was solely the business of Lord Draconus, Consort to Mother Dark.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In any case, it was not often of late that the Hold was home to its lord, now that he stood at her side in the Citadel of Kharkanas, making his sudden return after a night's hard ride both disquieting and the source of whispered rumours.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The thunder of horse hoofs approached through the faint light of the sun's rise - a light ever muted by the Hold's nearness to the heart of Mother Dark's power - and that sound grew until it rumbled through the arched gateway and pounded into the courtyard, scattering red clay from the road beyond. Neck arched by the reins held tight in his master's gloved hands, the warhorse Calaras drew up, breath billowing, lather streaming down its sleek black neck and chest. The sight gave the onrushing grooms pause.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The huge man commanding this formidable beast then dismounted, abandoning the reins to dangle, and strode without comment into the Great House. Household servants scrambled like hens from his path.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There was no hint of emotion upon the Lord's face, but this was a detail well known and not unexpected. Draconus gave nothing away, and perhaps it was the mystery in those so-dark eyes that had ever been the source of his power. His likeness, brushed by the brilliant artist Kadaspala of House Enes, now commanded pride of place in the Citadel's Hall of Portraits, and it was indeed a hand of genius that had managed to capture the unknowable in Draconus's visage, the hint of something beyond the perfection of his Tiste features, a deepening behind the proof of his pure blood. It was the image of a man who was king in all but name.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Arathan stood at the window of the Old Tower, having taken position there upon hearing the bell announcing his father's imminent return. He watched Draconus ride into the courtyard, eyes missing nothing, one hand up to his face as he bit skin and pieces of nail from his fingers - the tips were red nubs, swollen with endless spit, and on occasion they bled, staining the sheets of his bed at night. He studied the movements of Draconus as the huge man dismounted, carelessly abandoning Calaras to the grooms, to then stride towards the entrance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The three-storey tower commanded the northwest corner of the Great House, with the house's main doors to the right and out of sight from the upper floor's window. At moments like these, Arathan would tense, breath held, straining with all his senses for the moment when his father crossed the threshold and set foot on the hard bared stones of the vestibule. He waited, for a change in the atmosphere, a trembling in the ancient walls of the edifice, the very thunder of the Lord's presence.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As ever, there was nothing. And Arathan never knew if the failing was his, or if his father's power was sealed away inside that imposing frame and behind those unerring eyes, contained by a will verging on perfection. He suspected the former - he saw how others reacted, the tightening of expressions among the highborn, the shying away of those of lesser rank, and how on occasion both reactions warred within the same individual. Draconus was feared for reasons Arathan could not comprehend.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In truth, he did not expect more of himself in this matter. He was a bastard son, after all, and a child born of a mother he never knew and had never heard named. In his seventeen years of life he had been in the same room with his father perhaps twenty times; surely no more than that, and not once had Draconus addressed him. He was not privileged to dine in the main hall; he was tutored in private and taught the use of weapons alongside the recruits of the Houseblades. Even in the days and nights immediately following his near-drowning, when in his ninth winter he'd fallen through ice, he'd been attended to by the guards' healer, and had received no visitors barring his three younger half-sisters, who had peered in through the doorway - a trio of round, wide-eyed faces - only to immediately flee down the corridor voicing squeals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For years, their reaction upon seeing him had led Arathan to believe he was unaccountably ugly, a conviction that had first brought his hands to his face in a habit of hiding his features, and soon the kiss of his own fingertips served for all the tactile reassurance he required. He no longer believed himself to be ugly. Simply ... plain, not worthy of notice by anyone.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Though no one ever spoke of his mother, Arathan knew that she had named him. His father's predilections on such matters were far crueller. He told himself that he remembered his half-sisters' mother, a brooding, heavy woman with a strange face, who had either died or departed shortly after weaning the triplets she had borne, but a later comment from Tutor Sagander suggested that the woman he'd remembered had been a wet-nurse, a witch of the Dog-Runners who dwelt beyond the Solitude. Still, he preferred to think of her as the girls' mother, too kind-hearted to give them the names they now possessed - names that, to Arathan's mind, shackled each sister like a curse.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Envy. Spite. Malice.</i> They remained infrequent visitors to his company. Flighty as birds glimpsed from the corner of an eye. Whispering from around corners in the corridors and behind doors he walked past. Clearly, they found him a source of great amusement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now in the first years of adulthood, Arathan saw himself as a prisoner, or perhaps a hostage in the traditional manner of alliance-binding among the Greater Houses and Holds. He was not of the Dracons family; though there had been no efforts at hiding his bloodline, in fact the very indifference of this detail only emphasized its irrelevance. Seeds spill where they may, but a sire must look into the eyes to make the child his own. And this Draconus would not do. Besides, there was little of Tiste blood in him - he had not the fair skin or tall frame, and his eyes, while dark, lacked the mercurial ambivalence of the pure-born. In these details, he was the same as his sisters. Where, then, the blood of their father?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>It hides. Somehow, it hides deep within us.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Draconus would not acknowledge him, but that was no cause for resentment in Arathan's mind. Man or woman, once childhood was past the world beyond must be met, and a place in it made, by a will entirely dependent upon its own resources. And the shaping of that world, its weight and weft, was a match to the strength of that will. In this way, Kurald Galain society was a true map of talent and capacity. Or so Sagander told him, almost daily.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Whether in the court of the Citadel or among the March villages, there could be no dissembling. The insipid and the incompetent had no place in which to hide their failings. <i>'This is natural justice, Arathan, and thus by every measure it is superior to the justice of, say, the Forulkan, or the Jaghut.'</i> Arathan had no good reason to believe otherwise. This world, so forcefully espoused by his tutor, was all he had ever known.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet he ... doubted.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sandalled feet slapped closer up the spiral stairs behind him, and Arathan turned in some surprise. He had long since claimed this tower for his own, made himself lord of its dusty webs, its shadows and echoes. Only here could he be himself, with no one batting his hand away from his mouth, or mocking his ruined fingertips. No one visited him here; the house-bells called him when lessons or meals were imminent; he measured his days and nights by those muted chimes.</p> <p>The footsteps approached. His heart thumped in his chest. He snatched his hand away from his mouth, wiped the fingers on his tunic, and stood facing the gap of the stairs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The figure that climbed into view startled him. One of his half-sisters, the shortest of the three - <i>last from the womb</i> - her face flushed with the effort of the climb, her breath coming in little gasps. Dark eyes found his. 'Arathan.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>She had never before addressed him. He did not know how to respond.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'It's me,' she said, eyes flaring as if in anger. 'Malice. Your sister, Malice.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'Names shouldn't be curses,' Arathan said without thinking.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>If his words shocked her, the only indication was a faint tilt of her head as she regarded him. 'So you're not the simpleton Envy says you are. Good. Father will be ... relieved.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'Father?'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'You are summoned, Arathan. Right now - I'm to bring you to him.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'Father?'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>She scowled. 'She knew you'd be hiding here, like a redge in a hole. Said you were just as thick. Are you? Is she right? Are you a redge? She's always right - or so she'll tell you.' She darted close and took Arathan's left wrist, tugged him along as she returned to the stairs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>He did not resist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Father had summoned him. He could think of only one reason for that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>I am about to be cast out.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The dusty air of the Old Tower stairs swirled round them as they descended, and the peace of this place felt shattered. But soon it would settle again, and the emptiness would return, like an ousted king to his throne, and Arathan knew that he would never again challenge that domain. It had been a foolish conceit, a childish game.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>'In natural justice, Arathan, the weak cannot hide, unless we grant them the privilege. And understand, it is ever a privilege, for which the weak should be eternally grateful. At any given moment, should the strong will it, they can swing a sword and end the life of the weak. And that will be today's lesson. Forbearance.'</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A redge in a hole - the beast's life is tolerated, until its presence becomes a nuisance, and then the dogs are loosed down the earthen tunnel, into the warrens, and somewhere beneath the ground the redge is torn apart, ripped to pieces. Or driven into the open, where wait spears and swords eager to take its life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Either way, the creature was clearly unmindful of the privileges granted to it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All the lessons Sagander delivered to Arathan circled like wolves around weakness, and the proper place of those cursed with it. No, Arathan was not a simpleton. He understood well enough.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And, one day, he would hurt Draconus, in ways not yet imaginable. <i>Father, I believe I am your weakness.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the meantime, as he hurried along behind Malice, her grip tight on his wrist, he brought up his other hand, and chewed.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Master-at-arms Ivis wiped sweat from his brow while he waited outside the door. The summons had come while he'd been in the smithy, instructing the iron-master on the proper honing of a folded edge. It was said that those with Hust blood knew iron as if they'd suckled its molten stream from their mother's tit, and Ivis had no doubt in this matter - the smith was a skilled man and a fine maker of weapons, but Ivis possessed Hust blood on his father's side, and though he counted himself a soldier through and through, he could hear a flawed edge even as a blade was being drawn from its scabbard.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Iron-master Gilal took it well enough, although of course there was no telling. He'd ducked his head and muttered his apologies as befitted his lesser rank, and as Ivis left he heard the huge man bellowing at his apprentices - none of whom was in any way responsible for the flawed edge, since the final stages of blade preparation were always by the iron-master's own hand. With that tirade Ivis knew that no venom would come back his way from the iron-master.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>He told himself now, as he waited outside his lord's Chamber of Campaigns, that the sweat stinging his eyes was a legacy of the four forges in the smithy, the air wretched with heat and bitter metal, with coal dust and smoke, with the frantic efforts of the workers as they struggled with the day's demands.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Abyss knew, the smithy was no factory, and yet it had achieved an impressive rate of stock production in the past two months, and not one of the new recruits coming to the Great House was left unarmoured or weaponless for long. Making his task that much easier.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But now the Lord was back, unexpectedly, and Ivis scoured his mind for the possible cause. Draconus was a measured man, not prone to precipitous acts. He had the patience of stone, but all knew the risk of wronging him. Something had brought him back to the Great House, and a night's hard ride would not have left him in a good mood.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And now a summons, only to be left waiting here outside the door. No, none of this was normal.</p> <p>A moment later he heard footsteps and the portal clicked open. Ivis found himself staring into the face of the House tutor, Sagander. The old scholar had the look of a man who had been frightened and was still fighting its aftermath. Meeting Ivis's eyes, he nodded. 'Captain, the Lord will see you now.'</p> <p>That, and nothing more. Sagander edged past, made his way down the passageway, walking as if he'd aged a half-dozen years in the last few moments. At the notion, Ivis berated himself. He hardly ever saw the tutor, who overslept every morning and was often the last to make bed at night - there was no reason to imagine Sagander was anything more than disquieted by the early meeting, and perhaps an understandable stiffness as came with the elderly this early in the morning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Drawing a steadying breath, Ivis strode into t...</p></p><h2>Northland: A 4,000-Mile Journey Along America&#39;s Forgotten Border</h2><p><p><strong>Recommended by the <em>New York Times</em> Holiday Books Guide<br><br> A quest to rediscover America&#x2019;s other border&#x2015;the fascinating but little-known northern one.</strong></p><p>America&#x2019;s northern border is the world&#x2019;s longest international boundary, yet it remains obscure even to Americans. The northern border was America&#x2019;s primary border for centuries&#x2015;much of the early history of the United States took place there&#x2015;and to the tens of millions who live and work near the line, the region even has its own name: the northland.</p><p>Travel writer Porter Fox spent three years exploring 4,000 miles of the border between Maine and Washington, traveling by canoe, freighter, car, and foot. In <em>Northland</em>, he blends a deeply reported and beautifully written story of the region&#x2019;s history with a riveting account of his travels. Setting out from the easternmost point in the mainland United States, Fox follows explorer Samuel de Champlain&#x2019;s adventures across the Northeast; recounts the rise and fall of the timber, iron, and rail industries; crosses the Great Lakes on a freighter; tracks America&#x2019;s fur traders through the Boundary Waters; and traces the forty-ninth parallel from Minnesota to the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Fox, who grew up the son of a boat-builder in Maine&#x2019;s northland, packs his narrative with colorful characters (Captain Meriwether Lewis, railroad tycoon James J. Hill, Chief Red Cloud of the Lakota Sioux) and extraordinary landscapes (Glacier National Park, the Northwest Angle, Washington&#x2019;s North Cascades). He weaves in his encounters with residents, border guards, Indian activists, and militia leaders to give a dynamic portrait of the northland today, wracked by climate change, water wars, oil booms, and border security.</p> 5 maps</p><p>Porter Fox is the editor of Nowhere and the author of Deep. His writing has appeared in the New York Times, The Believer, Outside, National Geographic Adventure, and The Best American Travel Writing. Raised in Maine, he lives in New York.&#x201c;Whether experiencing run-ins with crusty locals, reviving long dead historical characters last heard from in high school history books, enduring rough weather or savoring majestic landscapes, he brings it all to vivid life. With strong descriptive powers and a clear appetite for his task, Fox succeeds in making his journey sound romantic, urgent, valuable and appealing as hell.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrew McCarthy, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Northland</em>...[has] that touch of jump and sparkle that every good travelogue needs.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Peter Lewis, <em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fox is an excellent guide, capturing the majesty of the Northland's diverse geology, flora, weather and seasons. But [his] greatest accomplishment is that he uses all of the landscape and history to capture the people who live and work on the border now.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Peter Geye, <em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Northland</em>&nbsp;is a revelation: a gripping east-west journey 3,987 miles along an invisible line. The book is filled with history, irony, adventure, finely drawn characters, and a true sense of place.

With a native northlander&#x2019;s knowledgeable and loving eye, Porter Fox seeks and finds the furtive beauties and forgotten histories of our borderlands to the north.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Donovan Hohn, author of <em>Moby-Duck</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this rip-roaring adventure story, Porter Fox illuminates every imaginable facet of the northern border: historical, natural, economic, environmental, geopolitical, and, above everything else, the human.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Neel Mukherjee, author of <em>A State of Freedom</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Porter Fox&#x2019;s wild trip across the rivers and lakes, prairies and mountains is at turns wondrous, meditative, and scary. In Fox&#x2019;s patient telling, the northland is less a border than a threshold, a kind of otherworldly membrane wherein people are in conversation with the stream systems and watersheds upon which life depends and that political boundaries work to ignore.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Sullivan, author of <em>My American Revolution</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A riveting illumination of the northern border&#x2019;s contentious past, made urgent by the denizens we meet along the pages who are fighting&#x2015;doggedly, courageously&#x2015;for the right to course-correct its future.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Courtney Maum, author of <em>Touch</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Northland</em>&nbsp;is more than a&nbsp;rollicking, acutely&nbsp;reported, and beautifully written account of an epic journey from Maine to Washington across the arc of this country&#x2019;s magnificent&nbsp;and half-forgotten boreal&nbsp;perimeter. It is also an illuminating, provocative, and&nbsp;poignant&nbsp;glimpse into what America once was&#x2015;along with a celebration&nbsp;of what remains of that same America&nbsp;along its&nbsp;obscure, dismissed, and unspeakably lovely northern frontier.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Kevin Fedarko, author of&nbsp;<em>The Emerald Mile</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Richly populated with fascinating northlanders, Native Americans, and many border patrol agents, this is highly entertaining and informative travel literature.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus (starred review)</em></strong></p><h2>A Biblical Economics Manifesto (Economics and the Christian Worldview)</h2><p>Combining biblical insights, scholarly research and common sense in this hard-hitting economic treatise, James P.

As she wrestles to get it back, a photograph falls to the ground--an old polaroid of three young women and their university professor. A relic from a past--and a love--Peri had tried desperately to forget.</p><p><i>Three Daughters of Eve</i> is set over an evening in contemporary Istanbul, as Peri arrives at the party and navigates the tensions that simmer in this crossroads country between East and West, religious and secular, rich and poor. Over the course of the dinner, and amidst an opulence that is surely ill-begotten, terrorist attacks occur across the city. Competing in Peri&#x2019;s mind however are the memories invoked by her almost-lost polaroid, of the time years earlier when she was sent abroad for the first time, to attend Oxford University. As a young woman there, she had become friends with the charming, adventurous Shirin, a fully assimilated Iranian girl, and Mona, a devout Egyptian-American. Their arguments about Islam and feminism find focus in the charismatic but controversial Professor Azur, who teaches divinity, but in unorthodox ways.

Or maybe it&#x2019;s just me. I&#x2019;m speaking here of your ordinary basic terrors, like the meaning of life or what if there&#x2019;s no meaning at all, or what if somebody pushes the red-alert button, or the economy collapses and we turn into ravaging beasts fighting over food, not to mention the noises in an old house when boards creak and things go bump in the night. Sometimes I think we&#x2019;re all tightrope walkers suspended on a wire two thousand feet in the air, and so long as we never look down we&#x2019;re okay, but some of us lose momentum and look down for a second and are never quite the same again: we know.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s why, when I found the note hidden in the old hurdy-gurdy, I didn&#x2019;t take it as a joke. I could smell the terror in the words even before I&#x2019;d finished reading the first sentence: They&#x2019;re going to kill me soon&#x2014;in a few hours, I think&#x2014;and somehow they&#x2019;ll arrange it so no one will ever guess I was murdered.<br> &nbsp;<br> But perhaps I&#x2019;d better explain about the hurdy-gurdy and why at my age, which is twenty-two, I am not out in the world setting it on fire, figuratively speaking, or graduating from Wellesley or Bryn Mawr, or doing any of those normal upper-middle-class things, but instead own and tend the Ebbtide Shop, Treasures &amp; Junk, Amelia Jones, Prop., 688 Fleet Street (not your best section of town).<br> &nbsp;<br> Actually it&#x2019;s because I&#x2019;m so free, a word I use loosely and not without irony. Due to circumstances I won&#x2019;t go into at the moment I have been quite alone in the world since I was eighteen, and with a rather strange childhood under my belt as well. When I was seventeen my father packed me off to a psychiatrist named Dr. Merivale. I think my father knew he was going to die soon and one day he looked across the room and saw me, really saw me&#x2014;perhaps for the first time&#x2014;and he thought, &#x201c;Good God!&#x201d; So off I went to Dr. Merivale, who was supposed to inject confidence and character into me in prescribed doses, three times a week, at forty-five dollars an hour, and a few months after I&#x2019;d begun seeing Dr. Merivale my father went to the hospital with his last heart attack and died. He left a rather surprising amount of money, to be doled out to me month by month until I was twenty-one by the First National Bank downtown. I think he hoped that Dr. Merivale would assume some kind of responsibility for me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I continued visiting Dr. Merivale for two years, at first out of sheer inertia, having nothing else in my life, but gradually I began to grow interested in what he was trying to do. Actually it was like going to college, except that while other girls were studying Jung and Freud out of textbooks in class I was collecting dreams for Dr. Merivale, learning the difference between super-ego and id, discovering that I came from a trauma-ridden family and that I was terrified of life. I crammed just like a student, reading books on psychology all day and half the night.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had an effect: one day I looked in a full-length mirror and realized why nobody had ever noticed me: I shouldn&#x2019;t have noticed me, either, in an over-sized gray sweater with stretched sleeves and a gray skirt with a crooked hem. I went out and bought a pair of bellbottom slacks, which were in style at that time, and a bright pink shirt, and a pair of sandals. The bellbottoms swished when I walked, and I liked that; the next week I bought a white sweater and then a blue one. One day I accused Dr. Merivale of being a stuffed shirt&#x2014;heady stuff! He was really very pleased with me after he&#x2019;d recovered from the initial shock. I can&#x2019;t say I blossomed physically: I was still thin and freckle-faced, with straight brown hair, but inside I was coming to life. I could almost forgive my mother for hanging herself when I was eleven.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the big house on Walnut Street was sold I moved into a boardinghouse&#x2014;Dr. Merivale insisted I be among people&#x2014;and fell into a very growth-oriented regime because I wanted to change as fast as possible. I set the alarm clock for eight, rose and did deep breathing exercises, then transcendental meditation for twenty minutes and after that half an hour of yoga followed by thirty minutes of Canadian Air Force calisthenics (aimed mostly, I have to confess, at increasing my bust measurement). Sometimes it was almost noon before I had breakfast. And three times a week I went to Dr. Merivale, and I hung mottoes all over the walls of my room like &#x201c;I am the master of my destiny and the captain of my soul.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But I still had nightmares every night.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was at the boardinghouse that I met Calley Monahan, who had freckles, too. What struck me first about him was his great calmness. He couldn&#x2019;t have been older than thirty, he had a red beard and red hair and every evening after dinner he would remain behind at the table and peel an apple, slowly and very intently. I knew nothing about him except his name and that he played the guitar; sometimes I would hear him practicing in his room, which was above mine: sweet lonely songs like &#x201c;Red River Valley&#x201d; and &#x201c;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&#x201d; After about three weeks we said hello when we met on the stairs&#x2014;I was feeling quite daring by that time&#x2014;and after a few more weeks I stopped going into a panic when he said &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; and one evening after dinner we actually had a conversation. He wanted to know what I did in my room all day.<br> &nbsp;<br> I rather incoherently stammered out an explanation&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t occur to me to dissemble&#x2014;and he said, &#x201c;So what does this doctor do for you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I said he was trying to free me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;From what, and for what?&#x201d; he asked pleasantly, looking up from his apple-peeling.<br> &nbsp;<br> I turned scarlet, and then after a moment said defiantly, &#x201c;Well, for one thing I&#x2019;ve learned I have an IQ of 140 and that frees me from feeling stupid, which is the way I&#x2019;ve felt all my life.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked at me for a long time, gravely, without amusement, which was merciful, and he seemed to be making up his mind about something. He said at last, quietly, &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better come and meet Amman Singh.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> What&#x2019;s strange about this is that after he took me to meet Amman Singh that evening I never saw Calley Monahan again, which always reminds me of Jung&#x2019;s speculations about &#x201c;meaningful coincidences&#x201d; in our lives, because if it weren&#x2019;t for Calley Monahan I would never have met Amman Singh. I would probably have joined the typing class that Dr. Merivale kept urging on me, and I would certainly never have found the note in the hurdy-gurdy. Sometimes I ask myself, would anyone else have discovered it, and if they did would they have cared, or done anything about it and changed the lives of so many people?<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s things like this that comfort me when I feel frightened about life.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was very nervous about going out for the evening with a young man, and quite unable to decide whether it was a date or not, so I compromised and wore the old gray sweater with the bellbottoms: half old life, half new. From somewhere Calley Monahan produced a motorcycle&#x2014;I hadn&#x2019;t known he had that&#x2014;and off we roared through the streets of the city with me hanging on for dear life. In spite of having lived all my life in Trafton I&#x2019;d never visited Clancy Street before, or even seen it. It was in the oldest section of town, a narrow street lined with decaying old houses, funny little shops and a few stalls set out on the sidewalks. We parked in front of a grimy wooden house with a lopsided front porch, climbed five flights of stairs to a grimy hall and walked into Amman Singh&#x2019;s room.<br> &nbsp;<br> The room was dim and not very clean and he was the oldest man I think I&#x2019;ve ever seen, and yet....&nbsp;His skin was the color of coffee and cream, with a network of fine lines crisscrossing it everywhere, not wrinkles so much as lines like filigree lace. He glanced at me just once as we came in, and I saw that his eyes were black, really black, like ink or a raven&#x2019;s wing or a black pearl, and so soft, so luminous they seemed to melt all over his face. When he looked at me I felt something inside of me melt, too. He sat cross-legged on the floor like a Buddha in pajamas; several people were crouched uncomfortably around him talking a language I couldn&#x2019;t understand.<br> &nbsp;<br> We sat down and waited. Being here struck me as weird and a little scary and yet I felt a sense of peacefulness flowing over me. It seemed to come from Amman Singh: his voice, for one thing, so soft, almost whispering as he replied to the others, and then of course those luminous kind eyes....&nbsp;I felt he wasn&#x2019;t trying to please anyone, or demand anything, he was simply there, and the others adjusted themselves to hear him. It was about ten minutes before he turned to Calley and said, &#x201c;You have brought a friend.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His eyes rested lightly on me. &#x201c;We have been speaking of violence.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The violence inside us all, the angers, the negative thoughts, the resentments, and greeds.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I nodded politely.<br> &nbsp;<br> He said in his soft, whispery voice, his eyes kind, &#x201c;When you entered this room I felt your violence.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now if there is one thing I felt I was not at that time it was violent. I was soft, malleable, shy and timid, and having doggedly visited Dr. Merivale for two years I determined to assert myself. I said indignantly&#x2014;after all who was this creepy old man who looked like a high lama in Lost Horizon&#x2014;&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t have violence in me, my psychiatrist is trying to teach anger to me, he says I don&#x2019;t want enough for myself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Spanish Best: The Fine Shotguns of Spain</h2><p>The extraordinary shotguns produced by the craftsman of Spain's Basque Country are no longer a secret.

Yet a number of key questions about this tragedy remain unanswered: How did the violence spread from community to community and so rapidly engulf the nation? Why did individuals make decisions that led them to take up machetes against their neighbors? And what was the logic that drove the campaign of extermination?</p><p>According to Scott Straus, a social scientist and former journalist in East Africa for several years (who received a Pulitzer Prize nomination for his reporting for the Houston Chronicle), many of the widely held beliefs about the causes and course of genocide in Rwanda are incomplete. They focus largely on the actions of the ruling elite or the inaction of the international community. Considerably less is known about how and why elite decisions became widespread exterminatory violence.</p><p>Challenging the prevailing wisdom, Straus provides substantial new evidence about local patterns of violence, using original research&#x2015;including the most comprehensive surveys yet undertaken among convicted perpetrators&#x2015;to assess competing theories about the causes and dynamics of the genocide. Current interpretations stress three main causes for the genocide: ethnic identity, ideology, and mass-media indoctrination (in particular the influence of hate radio). Straus's research does not deny the importance of ethnicity, but he finds that it operated more as a background condition. Instead, Straus emphasizes fear and intra-ethnic intimidation as the primary drivers of the violence. A defensive civil war and the assassination of a president created a feeling of acute insecurity. Rwanda's unusually effective state was also central, as was the country's geography and population density, which limited the number of exit options for both victims and perpetrators.</p><p>In conclusion, Straus steps back from the particulars of the Rwandan genocide to offer a new, dynamic model for understanding other instances of genocide in recent history&#x2015;the Holocaust, Armenia, Cambodia, the Balkans&#x2015;and assessing the future likelihood of such events.</p></p><p>"Scott Straus has written a path-breaking book that will command the attention of scholars of the Rwandan genocide and of collective violence. The combination of an engagement with and application of theories of collective violence, a deep knowledge of Rwanda, sophisticated methodology, and extraordinary field research has produced an account that brings us closer than ever to understanding what produced this tragic event. Not only does The Order of Genocide rank as one of the best books ever written on the Rwandan genocide, it is a major contribution to comparative politics and theories of violence."--Michael Barnett, Harold Stassen Chair at the Hubert H. Humphrey School and Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota <p> "Scott Straus's examination of the Rwanda genocide takes us to a new level of understanding of mass killing as a social and political phenomenon. The author's attention to social-science theory, his extensive use of hundreds of interviews with perpetrators, and his careful analysis of the historical and geographical determinants of the Rwandan events make this book an unusually important contribution to the burgeoning field of genocide studies."--Norman M. Naimark, author of Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in 20th Century Europe</p><p> </p><p>"The onset of the Rwandan genocide, its dynamics, and the individual motivations of its perpetrators can be best explained, Scott Straus finds, by the combined effects of an ongoing civil war, high levels of state power (and the attendant social pressure), and the existence of a system of ethnic classification--rather than mass feelings of ethnic antipathy, nationalist beliefs, or radio propaganda. With its cogent theorization, multi-method approach, rich micro-level data, and careful attention to causal mechanisms, The Order of Genocide is a decisive step forward in the social scientific study of a phenomenon that has been notoriously resistant to systematic approaches."--Stathis N. Kalyvas, Arnold Wolfers Professor of Political Science, Director, Program on Order, Conflict, and Violence, Yale University</p><p> </p><p>"The Order of Genocide is a real addition to what we know about the Rwandan genocide. Scott Straus describes the local organization of genocide--for example, information on the size of groups of attackers and the roles played by 'elite' and 'thugs.' He also profiles the perpetrators themselves in examining what moved them to act. The quotes from the perpetrators enrich the statistical data enormously and make the book come alive."--Alison Des Forges</p><p>Scott Straus is Professor of Political Science and International Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Three thousand years of history and the myths of many cultures, as well as the fates of a dozen unforgettable characters, will all collide one hot summer in 1958; and the events played out on Buckeye Road will amount to nothing less than a new and life-affirming vision of the American Southwest...and of America itself.</p><p>The vivid symbol of Buckeye Road is La Maravilla&#x2014;the blanket of marigolds laid upon graves in Mexican cemeteries, and the mythical dog, sacred to the Aztecs, who returns from the under-world to lead his master to Mictlan, the land of the dead. La Maravilla is the embodiment of belonging to two worlds, and of being torn between the love and fear of both. It is the condition and mystery borne by all who inhabit this American outback&#x2014;whether they are Blacks, Chicanos, Asians, Native Americans, Mexicans, European immigrants, or Anglo misfits. For Beto, the young boy at the center of this magnificent story, it is the dilemma that he must somehow resolve and emerge from whole. For Beto has no parents to guide him&#x2014;his mother has fled the "old ways" of her Mexican family for a bright new American life beyond the desert sunset in California, where "Indians are history and Sunday is for football, not church!" But in her place, and more than filling it, is Beto's aristocratic Spanish grandmother, a Catholic curandera with a passion for the music of Duke Ellington. He also has his grandfather, a Yaqui Indian whose spirit soars above a desert without frontiers. With this extraordinary first novel, Alfredo Vea, Jr., takes his place in the first rank of America<br><br></p></p><p><b>Alfredo Vea</b> was born in Arizona and worked as a migrant farm worker as a child and a young man. He served in Vietnam and after his discharge worked a series of jobs, ranging from truck driver to carnival mechanic, as he put himself through law school. Now a practicing criminal defense attorney, Vea is also the author of two previous novels, <b>La Maravilla</b> and <b>The Silver Cloud Cafe</b>. He lives in San Francisco, California.From attorney and onetime migrant farmworker V&#x201a;a, a bewitching debut based on childhood memories of a squatters' settlement outside 1950's Phoenix. Most multicultural stories pale next to nine-year-old Beto's boyhood in the desert with his Spanish-born grandmother--who struggles to reconcile her curing powers with Catholicism--and his pagan Yaqui grandfather--who can leave his body and fly. Okies, Arkies, African-Americans, Indians who sing Irish railroad songs, transvestites, prostitutes, the Chinese grocer and cook regard each other with suspicious curiosity. Even the Fuller Brush man here is an outsider: a mutilated concentration-camp survivor. All fling about racial stereotypes but can never get away from shared food and music, mutual respect, love. (The Mighty Clouds of Joy Church allows even sinners to tap into its electrical service; the whole community is connected by extension cords.) People live in cardboard houses and junked cars, but much of the novel is very funny; and when people do suffer, it's not from their material poverty: White Vernetta became a prostitute out of sorrow following the lynching-murder of her black/Filipino boyfriend; jealousy leads to crimes of passion; people struggle with remorse for failings toward God and man. Meanwhile, V&#x201a;a's cross-cultural translations weave enchantment as Beto's grandparents initiate him into values meant to sustain him in materialistic, nontribal mainstream USA. V&#x201a;a's uneasy mix of magic realism, essay, tragedy, broad comedy, and didactic speech never quite blends, but each element- -like the different races thrown together in the desert--forms an integral part of this astonishing fictionalized tribute. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The Stanford edition is based on the Colli-Montinari edition, which has received universal praise: "It has revolutionized our understanding of one of the greatest German thinkers"; "Scholars can be confident for the first time of having a trustworthy text."<br>Under the title <i>Unzeitgemï¿½sse Betrachtungen</i>, Nietzsche collected four essays published separately between 1873 and 1876: "David Strauss the Confessor and the Writer," "On the Utility and Liability of History for Life," "Schopenhauer as Educator," and "Richard Wagner in Bayreuth." The title, newly translated as <i>Unfashionable Observations</i>, spells out the common impulse linking these essays: Nietzsche's inimical attitude toward his "time," understood broadly as all the mainstream and popular movements that constituted contemporary European, but especially German, "culture" in the wake of the Prussian military victory over the French in 1871.<br>The <i>Unfashionable Observations</i> are foundational works for Nietzsche's entire philosophy, prefiguring both his characteristic philosophical style and many of the major ideas he would develop in his later writings. This is the first English translation to include Nietzsche's variants to the published text.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German"The Colli-Montinari edition has revolutionized our understanding of one of the greatest German thinkers. As a result of the new view opened up by this edition, Nietzsche has clearly come into his own as one of the more important philosophers of modern times. The English-language edition should become a classic that will be used by generations of scholars." (David E. Wellbery <i>The Johns Hopkins University</i>)<br><br>"The Colli-Montinari critical edition of Nietzsche's works is one of the most important works of scholarship in the humanities in the last quarter century. It was not until after World War II that one began to realize the extent to which Nietzsche's notebooks had been tampered with, jumbled, badly deciphered, and poorly edited, and it was not until the Colli-Montinari edition that scholars could be confident for the first time of having a trustworthy text."

Harvey)</p><h2>Why States Matter</h2><p>Why States Matter introduces students to the very tangible and constantly evolving implications, limitations, and foundations of America&#39;s state political institutions, and accessibly explains the ways that the political powers of the states manifest themselves in the cultures, economies, and lives of everyday Americans, and always will.</p><p>Gary F. Moncrief is University Foundation Professor of Political Science Emeritus at Boise State University. <br><br>Peverill Squire holds the Hicks and Martha Griffiths Chair in American Political Institutions at the University of Missouri.Since Why States Matter was first published, there have been many important political developments at the state level that have not only affected people's lives, but have also impacted the relationship between the federal and state governments. In the second edition Moncrief and Squire address many of these developments, and have therefore strengthened the argument that students and scholars interested in American politics should not neglect what happens in state legislatures across the country. I know my students will enjoy the new edition, as they have reacted positively to the state-level comparative approach taken by the authors. (Richard Ledet, Troy University)<br><br>"Why States Matter is a timely and important look at the role of the states in the American federal system. While much of the American public and media focus on Washington, D.C., Moncrief and Squire remind us of the crucial place of the states in the American system. The book provides an accessible but thorough introduction to state policy making and politics.

The casebook is organized with the reality and complexities of civil litigation in mind, and follows the litigation sequence, from pleading through preclusion. Each chapter takes a practical as well as analytical approach, through (a) a series of Supreme Court and lower court opinions, (b) notes preceding and following those opinions intended to explain the underlying doctrines and principles behind them, and (c) problems intended to assess and refine students understanding of doctrines and their rationales. Ultimately, this casebook demands that students read carefully and at a detailed level, analyze critically, and apply the law from the perspective of the theories underlying the various doctrines. It provides an effective vehicle through which to teach legal analysis and to gently nudge students forward and deeper into the materials.</p><p></p><h2>United States Protocol: The Guide to Official Diplomatic Etiquette</h2><p><i>United States Protocol</i> is a must-have reference for communicating with government and business officials, international organizations, and high-level military personnel, both in the United States and abroad. Everything you need is presented in a comprehensive, detailed, and well-organized book that makes it easy to navigate official protocol. Former President Bill Clinton says in his foreword that it is "an authoritative user's manual for international relations, it promises to become an indispensable reference&#x2015;not only for those in Washington, but for all Americans in contact with people in other nations." Ambassador Mary Mel French uses her personal experience as a former Chief of Protocol to give us the most up-to-date and user-friendly guide to diplomatic protocol at the international, national, and state level. She includes meticulous instructions, in-depth diagrams and tables, a comprehensive table of contents, and a plethora of examples that make <i>United States Protocol</i> the perfect guide to any official event.</p><p><b>Ambassador Mary Mel French</b> served as the nation's Chief of Protocol during the Clinton administration, working directly with the President and Secretary of State.In diplomacy, protocol emerges from an evolving sense of etiquette built on the solid foundation of tradition. For those in the private sector who entertain international guests, good protocol can be an essential ingredient for business success. In this volume, Mel French offers the definitive guide to the do's and don'ts of protocol and thereby provides a service to students of American foreign policy and practitioners of global commerce alike. (The Honorable Madeleine K. Albright, former Secretary of State)<br><br>Wonderfully entertaining and informative, the ins and outs of the Capital at its most elegant moments, for folks who attend and for those who wish they did.

(Ken Duberstein, former Chief of Staff to President Ronald Reagan)<br><br>French's book gives manners a modern twist and covers everything from how to address the president to writing a letter to your sheriff and who outranks whom in government. (<i>Politico</i>)<br><br><i>United States Protocol: The Guide to Official Diplomatic Etiquette</i> belongs on the shelves of any college-level political science or reference shelf. (<i>California Bookwatch, September 2010</i>)<br><br>White handles this extremely controversial topic in a fair, thorough, and nonpartisan manner, reaching logical conclusions. ? He takes the courageous step of calling for a serious debate on the application of just war theory to U.S. policy. He also raisesissues that deserve serious dialogue. Military and civilian leaders, clergy, political theorists, and concerned citizens will all gain a deeper moral understanding of conflict by engaging the questions that White raises. (<i>Military Review, September 2010</i>)<br><br>Ambassador Mel French is an accomplished professional who brought skill, elegance and etiquette to her work as White House chief of protocol. In this wonderful book, she shares her experience in a way that is as polished, personal, and entertaining as the countless high-level events she helped design for President Clinton and his administration. In today's world, international communication and cooperation are more important than ever. This book will be a valuable guide for government and business leaders alike. (Thomas F. McLarty, III, Former Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton)<br><br>Has it been awhile since someone asked you what the appropriate form of address might be for an ambassador? Or how one should arrange the seating at a diplomatic dinner? The art (or perhaps it is a science) of protocol is one that is rarely observed outside of the reaches of capital cities, but strict observance of rules can ease cultural differences and provide an orderly framework in all sorts of difficult situations. Author French, chief of protocol during the Clinton administration, is well qualified to lay out the proper way to get through an event with no offense. Her somewhat lighthearted presentation in no way impedes her seriousness of purpose, and the examples of problems that she or her predecessors encountered make this volume quite readable. The book starts with the order of precedence: who goes in first; titles and forms of address across cultures; and stations for letters, introductions, and place cards. It then moves on to how one behaves while visiting the president. Information on official entertaining, formal seating, and flag etiquette follow. There is an important and timely chapter on Internet protocol and a long section with various useful lists, such as facts about all the presidents and states, addresses of agencies and embassies, and American and religious holidays.All in all, this is a useful and inexpensive book that can serve as a reference source for party planners, letter writers, and anyone interested in knowing how things are done. The personal asides give a flavor of what it might be like to rub elbows with the powerful, and the readable prose encourages random dipping into sections. In this subject area, there is a 37-page PDF from the Foreign Service but nothing new published in the past 20 years. If your patrons have any interest in this area, it is a worthy purchase. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Ambassador French, former chief of protocol for the United States during President Clinton's administration, has written an in-depth book covering diplomatic protocol. The book is well organized and covers everything from the order of precedence (the order or ranking of a country's diplomats) to embassy names and addresses. In addition French discusses some of the finer points of entertaining or meeting with diplomats such as forms of address, table settings, flag etiquette, and even Internet protocol. At the end, a list of government websites, a glossary of protocol terms, and a bibliography are included. This title could easily prove useful not only for members of the U.S. government but also for state government officials when meeting with foreign dignitaries and even business leaders working with foreign government officials. A book of this nature may also benefit undergraduate and graduate students who need to contact the embassy of a foreign country to obtain information about that particular country or to request a meeting with the ambassador of that country. BOTTOM LINE This book would be a welcome addition to libraries with any international scope.

The third edition features more information concerning the history of beer especially in the United States; British, Japanese, and Egyptian beer; beer in the context of health and nutrition; and the various styles of beer. Author Charles Bamforth has also added detailed sidebars on prohibition, Sierra Nevada, life as a maltster, hopgrowing in the Northwestern U.S., and how cans and bottle are made. Finally, the book includes new sections on beer in relation to food, contrasting attitudes towards beer in Europe and America, how beer is marketed, distributed, and retailed in the US, and modern ways of dealing with yeast.<br></p><p><br><strong>Charles Bamforth</strong> is Chair of the Department of Food Science &amp; Technology and Anheuser-Busch Endowed Professor of Malting &amp; Brewing Sciences at the University of California, Davis<br><br><em>Books by same author Bamforth, Charles.

There has been an unfilled market for this type of book. . . . Happily, this book . . .is by a wide margin the best reference now available . . . The book is very well written. It has a light, almost breezy style that is mixed with a subtle yet attractively understated British wit. It is above all a great read that is hard to put down. The strongest part of this book is the discussion of the brewing process. . . . In summary, <em>Beer: Tap into the Art and Science of Brewing</em> is a brilliant achievement that nontechnical people will find accessible and quite valuable. It is also highly recommended for technical people because it does show how the art and science of brewing can be communicated effectively to a wider audience." -- <em>American Brewer</em><p></p><br>"The authoritative, clear and easily understood description of a complex, technical, and sometimes mysterious subject is the book's greatest value."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Solving Problems in Technical Communication</h2><p><p>The field of technical communication is rapidly expanding in both the academic world and the private sector, yet a problematic divide remains between theory and practice.

Was late antiquity therefore merely a time of decline? In this vibrant and compact introduction, Gillian Clark sheds light on the concept of late antiquity and the events of its time, showing that this was in fact a period of great transformation. Late antiquity saw Roman law codified, Christian creeds formulated, the Talmud compiled, and the Qur'an composed. If the Goths sacked the city of Rome, the Vandals built churches in Africa and Attila the Hun received an embassy from Constantinople. Anthony of Egypt and Simeon Stylites offered spectacular new models of holiness, while Augustine and Basil and Benedict devised rules for monastic communities. Late antique artists produced the mosaics of Ravenna and the first dome of Hagia Sophia. And it was also the period when emperors Diocletian in the third century and Justinian in the sixth enacted extensive and much-needed reforms of government.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gillian Clark</strong> is Emeritus Professor of Ancient History at the University of Bristol.<br></p><h2>The Theology of the Gospel of Luke (New Testament Theology)</h2><p>The Gospel of Luke, often mined for information about the life of Jesus, is also one of the earliest Christian examples of narrative theology.

An advocate of the return to sign language, Baynton found that although the grounds of the debate have shifted, educators still base decisions on many of the same metaphors and images that led to the misguided efforts to eradicate sign language. <br><br>"Baynton's brilliant and detailed history, <i>Forbidden Signs</i>, reminds us that debates over the use of dialects or languages are really the linguistic tip of a mostly submerged argument about power, social control, nationalism, who has the right to speak and who has the right to control modes of speech."&#x2014;Lennard J. Davis, <i>The Nation</i><br><br>"<i>Forbidden Signs</i> is replete with good things."&#x2014;Hugh Kenner, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>Douglas Baynton has written a learned history of the varied and sundry attempts that have been made to prevent deaf people from communicating with their hands. <i>Forbidden Signs</i> intelligently explores the cultural aspects of deafness, laying out the naturalness of a gesture-based means of communicating by deaf people, exploring the unique aspects by which meaning can be conveyed without the spoken word. In this context, the pseudo-scientific arguments for preventing the use of sign language which predominated for nearly a century are laid bare as the arbitrary and capricious biases of the hearing world. The rise of a quasi-biological notion of eugenics and genetic determinism as well as the construction of a standard of "normalcy" against which deaf people were measured explains both the means and the rationale for the suppression of sign language. The incredible story of the extensive attempts to isolate deaf people and to break up communities of signers that Douglas Baynton has recorded will likely be difficult to imagine by those who know little of the history of deafness in America. Unfortunately, it is likely a story too familiar to deaf people, even today.<b>Douglas C. Baynton</b> is professor of history at the University of Iowa, where he also teaches courses in the American Sign Language program.</p><h2>Speech Science: An Integrated Approach to Theory and Clinical Practice (Pearson Communication Sciences and Disorders)</h2><p><p> </p> <p> <b>Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

Arguing that religion must be understood in the first instance as deriving from rudimentary human experiences, from lived, embodied practices, S. Brent Plate asks us to put aside, for the moment, questions of belief and abstract ideas. Instead, beginning with the desirous, incomplete human body, he asks us to focus on five ordinary objects&#x2014;stones, incense, drums, crosses, and bread&#x2014;with which we connect in our pursuit of religious meaning and fulfillment. As Plate considers each of these objects, he explores how the world&#x2019;s religious traditions have put each of them to different uses throughout the millennia. Religion, it turns out, has as much to do with our bodies as our beliefs. Maybe even more.</p></p><p><b>S.

Being one of the two equal parts<br> into which a thing is or may be divided.<br> &#x2014;<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i><br> <i><br> <i>Less solace in these songs half-ourselves</i></i><br> <i>&amp; half-not.</i><br> &#x2014; Colin Cheney,<br> &#x201c;Half-Ourselves &amp; Half-Not&#x201d;<br><br> After making eight mostly successful movies, Federico Fellini&nbsp;set to work on&nbsp;<i>8ï¿½</i>. Since its release a half century ago, the surrealistic,&nbsp;self-reflexive motion picture has hit the tops of &#x201c;all-time&nbsp;best&#x201d; lists the world over. Fellini&#x2019;s film within a film portrays&nbsp;a middle-aged filmmaker, Guido Anselmi, played by Marcello&nbsp;Mastroianni. Between love and lust, desire and creativity, Guido&nbsp;quests for something, but seems unsure exactly what that might&nbsp;be. His life is incomplete and he knows it. He gestures toward&nbsp;love, often lasciviously, but as the beautiful Claudia suggests,&nbsp;he doesn&#x2019;t know how to love. Guido rhetorically queries her:&nbsp;&#x201c;Could you choose one single thing, and be faithful to it? Could&nbsp;you make it the one thing that gives your life meaning . . . just&nbsp;because you believe in it? Could you do that?&#x201d; &nbsp;The apparent&nbsp;answer is no, at least in his case. But the quest remains, and&nbsp;Guido&#x2019;s limited life persists.&nbsp;<br> Two and a half decades later, Julian Barnes inserted what he&nbsp;called a &#x201c;Parenthesis&#x201d; between chapters 8 and 9 of his novel&nbsp;<i>A History of the World in 10ï¿½ Chapters</i>. Equally as eccentric&nbsp;as Fellini&#x2019;s film, Barnes&#x2019;s fictional writings speculate on love,&nbsp;history, and artistic creation, meanwhile self-referentially questioning&nbsp;the author&#x2019;s role in it all. The parenthetical half chapter&nbsp;asks what it means for two people to love each other and the&nbsp;effects that may or may not have on a &#x201c;history of the world.&#x201d;&nbsp;Among other felicitous phrasings, Barnes likens love to a &#x201c;windscreen&nbsp;wiper across the eyeball.&#x201d; Even so, he wonders whether&nbsp;love is a &#x201c;useful mutation that helps the race survive.&#x201d; Or maybe&nbsp;it is a luxury, some value-added option to our lives: unnecessary&nbsp;but persistent. Regardless, &#x201c;we must believe in it, or we&#x2019;re lost.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> Two different works of art that examine love, desire, creativity,&nbsp;and the meaning of life, and both use &#x201c;1/2&#x201d; in their titles.&nbsp;What can this possibly mean? Is the half some extra value, like&nbsp;a baker&#x2019;s dozen? Or does it reflect something taken away, as&nbsp;if it was supposed to be the ninth but part of it was lost, or&nbsp;never finished? The beginnings of an answer were laid out a long&nbsp;time ago.<br> Almost two and a half millennia before Fellini and Barnes,&nbsp;the philosopher Plato wrote a work known as the&nbsp;<i>Symposium</i>,&nbsp;another meditation on the nature of love. In the midst of the&nbsp;convivial conversations of the story, Aristophanes stands up&nbsp;and presents what is perhaps the first artistic, amorous exploration&nbsp;of the half. The ancient playwright waxes mythological as&nbsp;he tells a comic tale of human origins: The first creatures were&nbsp;different&nbsp;from us, doubled in form from our present appearances;&nbsp;they had spherical bodies, with four hands, four feet,&nbsp;one head with two faces, and two sets of genitals. Because of&nbsp;their multiple hands and feet, they could move quite fast, and as<br> such made a cartwheeled attack on the gods, which sent shock&nbsp;waves through the heavenly realms. Instead of killing the human&nbsp;creatures&nbsp;in retribution, the great Zeus decided to split&nbsp;them all in half so that they would be &#x201c;diminished in strength&nbsp;and increased in numbers.&#x201d; The result is the human body we&nbsp;each have today, living our lives as incomplete creatures, always&nbsp;looking for our other half. Love, the story suggests, completes&nbsp;us by coupling us, making us whole again with the perfect fit&nbsp;of another creature.&nbsp;<br> Aristophanes&#x2019;s halving is, I suspect, what Fellini and Barnes&nbsp;were after in their approaches to the topic of love. The &#x201c;1/2&#x201d;&nbsp;in their titles, and mine, stands as a symbol of our incomplete&nbsp;natures,&nbsp;the need for a human body to be made whole through&nbsp;relations with something outside itself. &#x201c;No man is an island, entire&nbsp;of itself,&#x201d; as John Donne&#x2019;s seventeenth-century text declares.&nbsp;&#x201c;Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.&#x201d; Except&nbsp;that we get disconnected from our surroundings, from each&nbsp;other, from our gods, from the natural world, becoming floating&nbsp;islands. Our lives are half-lives, and we desire fulfillment,&nbsp;completion, wholeness. Aristophanes&#x2019;s mythologizing intimates&nbsp;that a perfect fit exists, somewhere out there, for our half bodies.&nbsp;<br> But this is not a book about finding a soul mate, one other&nbsp;human body that completes us. Many such books are readily&nbsp;available. This is about another kind of fullness, another kind&nbsp;of bonding for our coupling bodies, another kind of love. This is<br> about a religious love, though not necessarily the love of a god.&nbsp;<br> This book tells the story of the human half body, such as&nbsp;we are, and some of the objects we connect with in our quest&nbsp;for religiously meaningful, fulfilling lives. Because, let&#x2019;s face it,&nbsp;Aristophanes tells a nice tale, but another body&nbsp;<i>doesn&#x2019;t&nbsp;</i>actually&nbsp;complete us. We humans may experience a few, fleeting moments&nbsp;of all-consuming, all-connecting ecstasy that grow rarer&nbsp;as life goes on, but we don&#x2019;t, can&#x2019;t, live in that state. We still need&nbsp;to eat and explore, to touch and talk, to breathe plant-produced&nbsp;oxygen and drink from one stage of nature&#x2019;s water cycle. Moreover, our ability to love can be amazingly vast, well beyond&nbsp;directing our affections toward one other single creature. We&nbsp;love (and&nbsp;<i>love&nbsp;</i>is indeed the word) a very good meal, our children&nbsp;and their imaginary plays, the color orange just so at sunset, the&nbsp;feel of our cat&#x2019;s fur as we pet it, a film that makes us laugh, a&nbsp;book that makes us cry. All these things too we love. They link&nbsp;us with a world beyond our own skin. Taken collectively, these&nbsp;experiences make us feel as if we are not one-half but one.<br> Beginning with our incomplete half body, the following&nbsp;chapters discuss five types of objects that humans have engaged&nbsp;and put to use in highly symbolic, sacred ways: stones, incense,&nbsp;drums, crosses, bread. These objects are ordinarily common,&nbsp;basic, profane.&nbsp;<i>Profane&nbsp;</i>stems from the Latin roots&nbsp;<i>pro&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>fanus</i>,&nbsp;meaning &#x201c;outside the temple&#x201d;; in other words, the deep&nbsp;meaning of the profane is not inherently negative, just everyday&nbsp;life: houses, trinkets, bakers, and post offices are all outside the&nbsp;temple. Such is the paradox of religious experience: the most&nbsp;ordinary things can become extraordinary. We often forget this,&nbsp;overlooking the commonplace because we&#x2019;re trained to respond&nbsp;to mass media spectacles, expecting an overwhelming lightningbolt<br> transmission from on high. Or we do the opposite and believe&nbsp;that spiritual truths are to be found in some remote setting,&nbsp;far from the quotidian, in a pretense of utter silence and absence,&nbsp;usually a mountaintop, desert, or other spectacular natural&nbsp;setting. Situated in between these two extremes, the spiritual&nbsp;objects discussed here are things that many readers will come&nbsp;across in the course of the next twenty-four hours. Chances are,&nbsp;you will find them where you didn&#x2019;t expect to find them, right<br> under your noses, at your fingertips, on the tips of your tongues.<br><br> Connectors: USB ports, HDMI cables, DVI outlets, VGA adapters,&nbsp;110-volt three-prong plugs, 220-volt two-prong plugs. If&nbsp;you don&#x2019;t have the right connectors, you can&#x2019;t watch your highdefinition&nbsp;television, project your PowerPoint presentation, or&nbsp;use your hair dryer when traveling abroad. In the world of electronics&nbsp;much is incompatible, which makes it so nice when the&nbsp;right fit is found, when that crystal-clear connection is established&nbsp;and the show can go on.<br> We humans also&nbsp;<i>plug in</i>. Our bodies are a matrix of connecting&nbsp;points that, when used appropriately, allow us to relate to&nbsp;and draw breath, meaning, and inspiration from the environment&nbsp;around. James Cameron&#x2019;s blockbuster film&nbsp;<i>Avatar&nbsp;</i>portrayed&nbsp;something like this, as the blue-being Na&#x2019;vi had neural&nbsp;ponytails that directly jacked into the flora and fauna of their&nbsp;world, linking nervous systems across species. And we watched&nbsp;this bright new time-space in 3-D, thinking: &#x201c;How cool is that?&#x201d;&nbsp;Meanwhile, we forgot that we already have such connectors&nbsp;inherent in this very mortal coil.<br> The primary contact points between the self and the world&nbsp;are the sense organs: the mouth, nose, eyes, ears, and skin.*&nbsp;So vital are these to our being in the world that the ancient&nbsp;Greek philosopher Protagoras once claimed, &#x201c;Man is nothing&nbsp;but a bundle of sensations.&#x201d; These sense connectors are&nbsp;the meeting places for us to experience the world, the comings&nbsp;and goings that flow through the organs and open our bodies&nbsp;to life itself. We plug in with them. The human body feels&nbsp;the world, engages the sights and sounds, tastes and smells of&nbsp;one&#x2019;s setting,&nbsp;incorporating (literally, &#x201c;bringing into the body&#x201d;)&nbsp;the environment around. As the painter Paul Cï¿½zanne once&nbsp;claimed of his process, &#x201c;The landscape thinks itself in me, and I&nbsp;am its consciousness.&#x201d; Similarly, Diane Ackerman&#x2019;s wonderful&nbsp;work&nbsp;<i>A Natural History of the Senses&nbsp;</i>explores many of these<br> connections:&nbsp;<br> <i>There is no way in which to understand the world without&nbsp;first detecting it through the radar-net of our senses. . . .&nbsp;Our senses define the edge of consciousness, and because&nbsp;we are born explorers and questors after the unknown, we&nbsp;spend a lot of our lives pacing that windswept perimeter:&nbsp;We take drugs; we go to circuses; we tramp through jungles;&nbsp;we listen to loud music; we purchase exotic fragrances; we&nbsp;pay hugely for culinary novelties, and are even willing to&nbsp;risk our lives to sample a new taste.</i><br> To become more than a half being, more than a drifting island,&nbsp;we use our senses, the primary place of communion with the&nbsp;physical world, including the communion with other human&nbsp;bodies. And each of the senses has their appropriate objects of&nbsp;connection. Apart from some striking synesthetic experiences,&nbsp;basil&#x2019;s fragrance is not heard, a computer keyboard is not tasted,&nbsp;words on a page are not smelled. Proper connectors matter so&nbsp;that we can make sense of the objects in the world.<br> Because human experience and understanding is primarily a&nbsp;sensual bodily exercise, making a whole out of a half through&nbsp;the sense organs, religion itself is also deeply sensual. Ackerman&nbsp;doesn&#x2019;t name it as such here, but the explorations and questings<br> she describes are the stuff from which religion is made.&nbsp;Religion is more about such quests and questions than any answers&nbsp;and arrivals. Too often religion is explained as a &#x201c;set of&nbsp;beliefs,&#x201d; which primarily exist in the thought processes of the&nbsp;brain. The answers, having been found, are guarded behind the&nbsp;fortress of the forehead. The quest is over, we&#x2019;re all cleaned up,&nbsp;and life goes on. Religion, on this popular but ultimately misguided&nbsp;account, is about intellectual decisions regarding theism&nbsp;or atheism or polytheism, about correct thinking&#x2014;orthodoxy&nbsp;(<i>ortho</i>, meaning &#x201c;right&#x201d; and<i>dox</i>, meaning &#x201c;thinking&#x201d;) with&nbsp;regard to prophets and scriptures, about theological treatises&nbsp;and the content of preachers&#x2019; sermons. Symbols, rituals, and&nbsp;bodies are believed to be merely secondary expressions of some&nbsp;primary intellectual order. But this is to put the proverbial cart&nbsp;before the horse.<br> There is no thinking without first sensing, no minds without&nbsp;their entanglement in bodies, no intellectual religion without felt&nbsp;religion as it is lived in streets and homes, temples and theaters.&nbsp;Long before intellectual, systematic thoughts arise in the cognitive&nbsp;workings of humans, long before abstract ideas emerge&nbsp;about deities who create and destroy, the senses actively receive&nbsp;and process information about the world and make meaning of&nbsp;it. Religion, being a prime human activity throughout history,&nbsp;is rooted in the body and in its sensual relations with the world.&nbsp;It always has been and always will be. We make sense out of&nbsp;the senses. This is the first true thing we can say about religion,&nbsp;because it is also the first true thing we can say about being human.&nbsp;We are sentient beings, and religion is sensuous.&nbsp;<br> The prolific Romanian-born historian of religions Mircea&nbsp;Eliade&nbsp;thought long and hard about what makes certain activities,&nbsp;gatherings, objects, people, and beliefs &#x201c;religious&#x201d; and not&nbsp;just some other part of mundane existence. Reading across multiple&nbsp;languages, modern and ancient, Eliade articulated some of&nbsp;the most important ideas for the scholarly study of religion, and&nbsp;his influence still continues to be felt a quarter century after his&nbsp;death. While many aspects of religious experience (myths, rituals,&nbsp;and symbols most prominently) are found in most cultures&nbsp;and times, Eliade is also clear about the role of the senses in making&nbsp;and shaping religion: &#x201c;Broadly speaking, there can be no&nbsp;religious experience without the intervention of the senses. . . .&nbsp;Throughout religious history, sensory activity has been used as&nbsp;a means of participating in the sacred and attaining to the divine.&#x201d;&nbsp;Eliade goes on to examine anthropological and mythological&nbsp;accounts of shamans, magicians, and healers and how&nbsp;they undergo a profound reshaping of their sense perceptions&nbsp;in order to achieve their appointed vocation. The shaman does&nbsp;not see, smell, or hear like ordinary people but &#x201c;through the&nbsp;strangely sharpened sense of the shaman, the sacred manifests&nbsp;itself.&#x201d; Which is not unlike the role often ascribed to the artist&nbsp;and poet in secular societies, who offer new ways of seeing, new&nbsp;ways of being. The parallels between artists and shamans, poets&nbsp;and priests will be one of the underlying aspects of the following&nbsp;chapters.<br> While shamans are his prime examples, Eliade notes that&nbsp;<i>all&nbsp;</i>religious people experience the sacred primarily in and through&nbsp;the senses. This should be obvious to anyone who reflects for&nbsp;long on religion and how it happens: incense fills the nostrils of<br> a Krishna devotee in a temple in Vrindavan, India, letting him&nbsp;know he is in a sacred place; Muslim worshipers heed the muezzin&#x2019;s&nbsp;amplified call to prayer from the minaret of a Moroccan&nbsp;mosque; a girl tastes bitter herbs at a Passover Seder in Brooklyn,&nbsp;reminding her of the harshness of her ancestors&#x2019; slavery&nbsp;in Egypt; a Greek Orthodox woman gazes reverently upon an&nbsp;ic...</p><h2>Heaven is Real But So is Hell: An Eyewitness Account of What is to Come</h2><p>In Heaven is Real But So is Hell, internationally renowned speaker, author and mystic Vassula Ryden takes the reader into the supernatural world where she has experienced the hidden forces that affect every moment of our lives.

This is Israel, first published in 1962, visits the Promised Land, a sun-drenched panorama of many hues and many traditions. From the Sea of Galilee to the Red Sea (it&#x2019;s really blue); from modern Tel Aviv to Jerusalem new and old; from Mt.

A scholar of Christian liturgy, doctrine, and art, Jensen presents the history of early Christian initiation the way it was experienced--as a unified whole. Integrating image with practice and interpretation, Jensen offers a deep and insightful look into early Christian baptism. <i>Baptismal Imagery in Early Christianity</i> is so clear and direct it can easily serve as a solid introductory text; at the same time it is so thoroughly researched it will serve scholars of early Christian history, liturgy, and art for years to come. This much welcome and much-needed volume is not to be missed."<br>--<b>Todd Johnson</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"To examine how early Christians enacted, experienced, and reflected upon baptism, Jensen utilizes an array of sources for her work: ritual texts, theological treatises, various genres of ancient literature, and most importantly for this study the visual arts and the design and decoration of the ritual space. By drawing together the different types of textual and nontextual evidence, Jensen offers the reader a fuller picture of the sacrament's complexity, particularly as considered through the theological motifs of cleansing, initiation, enlightenment, death and resurrection, and the eschatological restoration of creation."<br>--<b>Karen B. Westerfield Tucker</b>, Boston University<br><br>"Through her engaging exploration of the images, language, and symbols of early Christian baptismal rites, Jensen invites readers to consider anew the theological meaning and power of baptism for contemporary worshipers. Jensen's clarity of expression and the striking photos bring to life ancient ritual practices as well as illuminate some of the intriguing peculiarities of early Christian art and worship. Her presentation of baptism through five core motifs offers historical and theological insights about baptism that are valuable for historians and theologians as well as ministry students and pastoral leaders."<br>--<b>Jill Crainshaw</b>, Wake Forest Divinity School<br><br>"Jensen brings her scholarly acumen and aesthetic sensibility to the interpretation of the principal motifs of the early Christian baptismal ritual. Adding to her impressive writings on the subject of baptism, this book is addressed to a more popular audience but with solid scholarly support. These thematic studies elucidate the effects and meaning of the baptismal liturgy as a sensory, symbolic, and spiritual experience for its recipients."<br>--<b>Everett Ferguson</b>, Abilene Christian University<b>Robin M.

Pat Monaghan has studied and taught many integrated studies in poetry, science, mythology, feminist spirituality, environmental studies, chaos theory, and religion. All of these disciplines inform her writing, but none distract from the poetic story-telling or the mystical lore she encounters and then conveys. Her journey takes her to a churchyard with a fountain representing St. Bridget, perhaps a Christian representation of the Celtic goddess of water, fire, and transformation, called Brigit. Monaghan describes spiral petroglyphs and ancient sacred caves, bogs and woods where fairies have played their tricks on humans, and water falls that became sacred spots. The stories instruct and teach, as Monaghan points to ways that these myths still reveal the truths of human life, and the contradictions of love and hate, mother and seductress, harmony and struggle that are embodied in women&#x2019;s lives in all of human existence.</p><p>Monaghan begins with a confession of sorts. Raised in Alaska, she always had thought of herself as Irish yet for a long time knew next to nothing about Ireland. In her mind's eye, her ancestral home was part myth, part history--unreal and intangible. Here she tells the story of going home for the first time, as it were. Her Ireland isn't one place but a mosaic of places, and as she travels the byways of old Ireland, which aren't far removed from contemporary Ireland, tracing the pagan calendar of the Celtic year, she also explores Ireland's fierce love of poetry (she reminds us that books of poetry often appear on Irish best-seller lists). She makes a poet's circuit as well as an Irish American's journey into the spiritual and ancestral past--and present--and from Connacht and Ulster to Leinster and Munster, she proves a perfect guide, introducing long-departed ancestors and a land in which the human, the natural, and the divine come together. A dreamy, utterly enchanting walking meditation on Ireland's pagan heart. <i>June Sawyers</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

That groundbreaking book proposed a new blueprint for the American home: a house that values quality over quantity, with an emphasis on comfort and beauty, a high level of detail, and a floor plan designed for today's informal lifestyle.</p> <p><strong><i>Creating the Not So Big House</i></strong> is the blueprint in action. Focusing on key design strategies such as visual weight, layering, and framed openings, Sarah Susanka takes an up-close look at 25 houses designed according to Not So Big principles. The houses are from all over North America in a rich variety of styles -- from a tiny New York apartment to a southwestern adobe, a traditional Minnesota farmhouse, and a cottage community in the Pacific Northwest. Whether new or remodeled, these one-of-a-kind homes provide all the inspiration you need to create your own Not So Big House.</p></p><p>Sarah Susanka has a not-so-insignificant idea in <i>Creating the Not So Big House</i>. She contrasts the glamorous, glossy-photo house plans of vaulted ceilings and palatial living rooms with the livable, day-to-day pleasure of cozy window seats and comfortable breakfast nooks, and her conclusion is resonating with families across the country: bigger but shoddier isn't better than smaller and well made. Descriptors like "spacious" and "expansive" fill the real-estate promos, but Susanka seeks the elusive yet affordable qualities that turn a house into a home. And she provides more than mere ideals around which to rally. She selected 25 house designs, from a southwestern adobe to a Minnesota farmhouse to a New York apartment to a Rhode Island summer cottage, and she profiles each home in great and well-illustrated detail.<p> Her ideas for interior as well as exterior views, airy stairways, diagonal views, and framed openings translate well in an array of different houses appropriate to childless couples and large families, as well as hot climes in Texas and cooler regions in Vermont. There are traditional designs to fit in with Massachusetts styling and contemporary designs to adapt to California cliffs, and they range from country spaces to suburban homes to city apartments.</p><p> Susanka selected house plans that are available for sale, because her purpose is to make affordable quality housing accessible to the general public, but they're also presented as catalysts for your own designs, because the house that worked for one person might inspire the plan that would work best for you. Whether you're in the market for a new house, want pragmatic renovation ideas, or are interested in the concept of space-saving abodes from a city-planning, philosophical perspective, Susanka's book is an eye-opener and a mind-expander, providing conceptual and practical tools to assist you in planning your own livable home. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>Sarah Susanka is one of the leading residential architects in the United States.

This special new edition with beautiful color artwork is a touching and emotive story for children and adults to treasure.</p><p><b>Michael Foreman</b> is one of the outstanding creators of children's picture books today.&nbsp;He&nbsp;has won an&nbsp;array of prizes, including the Kate Greenaway Award, the Smarties Book Prize, the Kurt Maschler Award, and the Children's Book Award.Dedicated to the memory of four uncles who died in WW I, Foreman's moving, informative follow-up to War Boy is crammed with concrete details and permeated with emotion. Freddie, Billy, Lacey and Will, youths from the English countryside, find themselves caught up in the euphoria of flag-waving and patriotism when war breaks out in 1914. From every mailbox, every wall, posters demand devotion to king and country; reproductions of these posters alternate with Foreman's understated watercolors. Amid cheers and jubilation, the four sign up. Their excitement is palpable as they head off to France, and the sensitive illustrations distill their sense of adventure. "We'll be back by Christmas," they think, but are met at the front with gunfire, rain, mud, hunger and death. Hope reigns anew on Christmas Day, when the Germans and the "Tommies" play soccer, exchange gifts and greetings, but it is short-lived. Foreman draws the many sides of war with heartbreaking clarity as he transmutes the personal experiences of his uncles into a universal story. Artwork shimmers with the luster of memory and fellow-feeling; a gentle gleam rises even from military hardware, which serves to both soften and highlight the horror of war. History springs to life in this admirable work, the 1993 winner of Britain's Smarties Book Prize.

On New Hampshire 16, the serpentine roadway from Portsmouth almost to the Canadian border, light traffic wound lazily through waves of heated air. Far to the west, a border of heavy, violet storm clouds rimmed the horizon.<br> The drive north, especially on afternoons like this, was one Zack Iverson had loved for as long as he could remember. He had made the trip perhaps a hundred times, but each pass through the pastureland to the south, the villages and rolling hills, and finally, the White Mountains themselves, brought new visions, new feelings.<br> &nbsp;<br> His van, a battered orange VW camper, was packed solid with boxes, clothes, and odd pieces of furniture. Perched on the passenger seat, Cheapdog rested his muzzle on the windowsill, savoring the infrequent opportunity to view the world with his hair blown back from in front of his eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Zack reached across as he drove and scratched the animal behind one ear. With Connie gone from his life, and most of his furniture sold, Cheapdog was a rock&#x2014;an island in a sea of change and uncertainty.<br> &nbsp;<br> Change and uncertainty. Zack smiled tensely. For so many years, June the thirtieth and July the first had been synonymous with those words. Summer jobs in high school; four separate years in college, and four more in medical school; internship; eight years of surgical, then neurosurgical, residency&#x2014;so many changes, so many significant June-the-thirtieths. Now, this day would be the last in that string&#x2014;a clear slash between the first and second halves of his life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Next year, the date would, in all likelihood, slip past as just another day.<br> &nbsp;<br> Highway 16 narrowed and began its rollercoaster passage into the mountains. Zack glanced at his watch. Two-thirty. Frank and the Judge were at their club, probably on the fourth or fifth hole by now. Dinner wasn&#x2019;t until six. There was no need to hurry. He pulled off into a rest area.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cheapdog, sensing that this was to be a stop of substance, shifted anxiously in his seat.<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, mop-face,&#x201d; Zack said. &#x201c;You get to escape for a while. But first...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He took a frayed paperback from between the seats and propped it up on the dash. Instantly, the dog&#x2019;s squirming stopped. His head tilted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You appreciate, I can see, the price that must be paid for the freedom you are about to enjoy. Yes, dogs and girls, it&#x2019;s time for&#x201d;&#x2014;he took the silver dollar from his shirt pocket and read from the page&#x2014;&#x201c;a classic palm and transfer, Italian style.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The book, Rufo&#x2019;s Magic with Coins, was a 1950s reprint Zack had stumbled upon in a Cambridge secondhand bookstore.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amaze your friends...Amuse your family...Impress members of the opposite sex...Sharpen your manual dexterity.<br> &nbsp;<br> The four claims, embossed in faded gold leaf on the cover, each held a certain allure for him. But it was the last one of the group that clinched the sale.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you see?&#x201d; he had tried to explain to a neurosurgical colleague, as he was fumbling through the exercises in Chapter One. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re only in the O.R.&#x2014;what?&#x2014;a few hours a day at best. We need something like this to keep our hands agile between cases&#x2014;to sharpen our manual dexterity. The way things are, we&#x2019;re like athletes who never practice between games, right?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, although the principle behind that thought was noble enough, the implementation had given rise to a most disconcerting problem. For while Zack&#x2019;s hands were quite remarkable in the operating &#x201c;room, even for a neurosurgeon, he had as yet been unable to master even the most elementary of Rufo&#x2019;s tricks, and had been reduced to practicing before mirrors, animals, and those children who were unaware of his vocation.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, dog,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;get ready. I&#x2019;m going to omit the patter that goes with this one because I can see you eyeing those birches out there. Now, I place the coin here...and snap my wrist like this, and...and voila! the coin it is gone....Thank you, thank you. Now, I simply pass my other hand over like this, and...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The silver dollar slipped from his palm, bounced off the emergency-brake lever, and clattered beneath the seat.<br> The dog&#x2019;s head tilted to the other side.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; Zack muttered. &#x201c;It was the sun. The sun got in my hands. Well, sorry, dog, but one trick&#x2019;s all you get.&#x201d;<br> He retrieved the coin and then reached across and opened the passenger door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cheapdog bounded out of the camper, and in less than a minute had relieved himself on half a dozen trees, shambled down a steep, grassy slope, and belly flopped into the middle of a mountain stream.<br> &nbsp;<br> Zack followed at a distance. He was a tall man with fine green eyes and rugged looks that Connie had once described as &#x201c;pretty damn handsome...in a thuggy sort of way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He wandered along the edge of the slope, working the stiffness of the drive from his bad knee and watching as Cheapdog made a kamikaze lunge at a blue jay and missed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Do you know, boy? he wondered. Do you know that the rehearsal&#x2019;s over? That we&#x2019;re not going back to the city again?<br> &nbsp;<br> He squinted up at the mountains. The Rockies, the Tetons, the Smokies, the Sierras, the northern Appalachians&#x2014;an avid rock climber since his teens, he had climbed at one time or another in all of them. There was something special, though, something intimate and personal that he felt in the White Mountains and nowhere else; they seemed to be giving him a message&#x2014;that the world, his life, were right where they should be.<br> &nbsp;<br> The demands of surgical training had exacted a toll on every aspect of his existence. But of all those compromises and sacrifices, the unavoidable cutback in his climbing was the one he had accepted the most reluctantly. Now, at almost thirty-six, he was anxious to make up for lost time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thin Air...Turnabout and Fair Play...The Widow-Maker...Carson&#x2019;s Cliff...Each climb would be like rediscovering a long-lost friend.<br> &nbsp;<br> Zack closed his eyes and breathed in the mountain air. For months he had wrestled with the choice of a career in academic medicine or one in private, small-town practice. Of all the decisions he had ever made&#x2014;choosing a college, medical school, a specialty, a training program&#x2014;this was the one that had proved the most trying.<br> &nbsp;<br> And even after he had made it&#x2014;after he had weighed all the pros and cons, gotten Connie&#x2019;s agreement, and opted to return to Sterling&#x2014;his tenuous decision was challenged. The ink was barely dry on his contract with Ultramed Hospitals Corporation when Connie announced that she had been having serious second thoughts about relocating from the Back Bay to northern New Hampshire, and in fact, that she was developing a similar case of cold feet over being engaged to the sort of man who would even consider such a move.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not two weeks later, the ring had arrived at his apartment in its original box, strapped to a bottle of Cold Duck.<br> &nbsp;<br> Zack sighed and combed his dark brown hair back with his fingers. They were striking, expressive fingers&#x2014;sinewy, and so long, even for the hands of a six-footer, that he had taken to sending to a medical supply house in Milwaukee for specially made gloves. Early on, those fingers had set him apart in the operating room, and even before that, on the rock face.<br> &nbsp;<br> He gazed to the northwest and swore he had caught a glimpse of Mirror, an almost sheer granite face so studded with mica that summer sun exploded off it like a star going nova.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lion Head...Tuckerman Ravine...Wall of Tears...<br> &nbsp;<br> There was so much magic in the mountains, so much to look forward to. True, life in Sterling might prove less stimulating than in the city. But there would be peace and, as long as he could climb, more than enough excitement as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> And, of course, there would be the practice itself&#x2014;the challenges of being the first neurosurgeon ever in the area.<br> &nbsp;<br> In less than twenty-four hours, he would be in his own office in the ultramodern Ultramed Physicians and Surgeons clinic, adjacent to the rejuvenated Ultramed-Davis Regional Hospital.<br> &nbsp;<br> After three decades of preparation and sacrifice, he was finally set to get on with the business of his life&#x2014;to show his world, and himself, exactly what he could do. The prospect blew gently across what apprehensions he had, scattering them like dry leaves.<br> &nbsp;<br> Connie or no Connie, everything was going to work out fine.</p><h2>Read through the Bible in a Year Devotional</h2><p><b>Read Your Way through the Bible in a Year--with This Exciting Devotional!</b><br><br> This lovely devotional, created especially for you, features&nbsp;a simple plan for reading through the Bible in one year with an accompanying devotional thought inspired by that day&#x2019;s Bible reading.&nbsp;Each day's devotion will encourage you&nbsp;to read a passage from the Old Testament, New Testament, and Psalms or&nbsp;Proverbs and provides a relevant spiritual takeaway for practical, everyday living.&nbsp;A beautiful way to spend a year in God&#x2019;s Word!&nbsp;</p><p>This lovely devotional, created especially for you, features&nbsp;a simple plan for reading through the Bible in one year with an accompanying devotional thought inspired by that day&#x2019;s Bible reading.&nbsp;Each day's devotion will encourage you&nbsp;to read a passage from the Old Testament, New Testament, and Psalms or&nbsp;Proverbs and provides a relevant spiritual takeaway for practical, everyday living.&nbsp;<b>Emily Marsh</b>&nbsp;lives in Virginia with her husband, Seth.

These five <em>solas</em> do not merely summarize what the Reformation was all about but have served to distinguish Protestantism ever since. They set Protestants apart in a unique way as those who place ultimate and final authority in the Scriptures, acknowledge the work of Christ alone as sufficient for redemption, recognize that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone, and seek to not only give God all of the glory but to do all things vocationally for his glory.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>2017 will mark the 500th anniversary of the Reformation. And yet, even in the twenty-first century we need the Reformation more than ever. As James Montgomery Boice said not long ago, while the Puritans sought to carry on the Reformation, today &#x201c;we barely have one to carry on, and many have even forgotten what that great spiritual revolution was all about.&#x201d; Therefore, we &#x201c;need to go back and start again at the very beginning. We need another Reformation.&#x201d;[1] In short, it is crucial not only to remember what the <em>solas</em> of the Reformation were all about, but also to apply these <em>solas</em> in a fresh way in light of many contemporary challenges.</p><p>[1]James Montgomery Boice, &#x201c;Preface,&#x201d; in <em>Here We Stand: A Call from Confessing Evangelicals </em>(Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1996), 12.</p></p><p><p>Carl Trueman is professor of Historical Theology and Church History at Westminster Theological Seminary. He is the author of numerous books, including <em>The Creedal imperative: Histories and Fallacies; Goods Rush in Where Monkeys Fear to Tread; Republocat: Confessions of a Liberal Conservative; Reformation Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow; John Owen: Reformed, Catholic, Renaissance Man, Minority Report; </em>and <em>The Wages of Spin</em>. Trueman is also a contributor to Reformation21 where he writes from a Reformed vantage point.</p><br><br><p>Matthew Barrett (Ph.D., The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) is Associate Professor of Christian Theology at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, as well as executive editor of <em>Credo Magazine. </em>He is the editor of The Five Solas Series and the author of several books, including <em>God's Word Alone</em>, <em>Reformation Theology, Salvation by Grace, </em>and <em>Owen on the Christian Life.</em></p>Trueman takes complex biblical and theological ideas and makes them easy to understand. The key message is that God's grace, healing our sinful neediness, is at the heart of true biblical piety. Trueman develops this theme with relation to the Church, preaching, sacraments, and prayer. As a Catholic, I resonated deeply with Trueman's portrait of biblical piety, and I found much else to treasure--including his emphasis on the priority of God's action and his stirring account of the ministry of preaching. This is a book that will instruct everyone who loves the gracious Lord Jesus Christ. -- Matthew Levering, James N. and Mary D. Perry Jr. Chair of Theology, Mundelein Seminary<br><br>Grace is a word so common in our day and age as to border on the clichï¿½. Yet prizing the gospel means treasuring grace. Carl Trueman does us all the service, then, of helping to make connections that are crucial: between grace and the active presence of the triune God, between the promises of the Old Testament and the intervention recounted in the New, between the ancient faith of the early fathers and later Protestant reforms, and between a rich theology of grace and its necessary implications for piety and worship. This book brings remarkable biblical, historical, and pastoral perspective to an oftentimes ambiguous but genuinely amazing reality. -- Michael Allen, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando, FL<br><br>This is an outstanding book on an extraordinary subject. It clearly explains the biblical foundations of grace, and navigates the historical debates in a way that is both highly engaging and deeply informed. Perhaps even more importantly, the practical applications of grace &#x2013; both for individuals and for churches &#x2013; are sharply driven home. I am grateful this book was written, and I highly commend it to any and all who are interested in learning more about the matchless grace of the Triune God. -- Jonathan L. Master, Professor of Theology and Dean of the School of Divinity, Cairn University<br><br>Trueman, a master of the art of making historical texts of the Christian tradition relevant and applicable for use in our time, effectively presents the ways in which Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, and Calvin put the foundational biblical concept of grace to work in their day. This serves him well as a basis for a lively exploration of how God&#x2019;s grace functions in the church today through the proclaimed Word of God, the sacraments, and believers&#x2019; prayer. This volume demonstrates how grace, as the lively disposition of God in Christ, frames God&#x2019;s dealing with a sinful world as Trueman confesses its significance for the twenty-first century. -- Robert Kolb, Professor of Systematic Theology emeritus, Concordia Seminary, Saint Louis<br><br>Where is grace? What is grace? Who is grace? And how is it conferred to us? I resonate with Trueman&#x2019;s lament that grace has become an empty sentiment in much of contemporary Christian literature. What does the Reformation cry &#x201c;grace alone&#x201d; really mean? And why is it so important today? To answer these questions, Trueman gives us both a history and a theology of grace. He shows the reader that grace is confrontational, that one can&#x2019;t have a proper understanding of grace without a proper understanding of sin. Read this book to learn what a grace alone church takes seriously. -- Aimee Byrd, Director of Women&#x2019;s Initiatives at The Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals<br><br>Carl Trueman is always worth reading. I am especially eager to recommend this excellent volume on the Protestant battle cry &#x201c;Grace Alone.&#x201d; It is obvious that it comes from one who is both a scholar and a churchman. It at once challenges the mind and warms the heart with the grand theme of God&#x2019;s gracious salvation. This is a book to be savored. -- Todd Pruitt, Pastor, Covenant Presbyterian Church, Harrisonburg, VA</p><h2>The Book of Candlelight (A Secret, Book and Scone Society Novel)</h2><p><b>In the new Secret, Book, and Scone Society novel from <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Ellery Adams, the rain in Miracle Springs, North Carolina, has been relentless&#x2014;and a flood of trouble is about to be unleashed . . . </b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> As the owner of Miracle Books, Nora Pennington figures all the wet weather this spring is at least good for business.

The Hills were unrivaled connoisseurs with a family tradition of violin-making, restoration, and scholarship. Several of their books form the basis of our knowledge of old stringed instruments. This generously illustrated volume offers both a history of the Guarneri family and a commentary on their craftsmanship.<br>The Hills describe and analyze the life and work of each of the five great master craftsmen of the Guarneri family, from Andrea Guarneri (c. 1626&#x2013;98), the founding father, to his grandsons Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesï¿½ (1698&#x2013;1744), the most illustrious member of the family, and Pietro Guarneri of Venice (1695&#x2013;1762). Over 130 photographs, 16 in full color, illustrate Guarneri craftsmanship in consummate detail. The craft of each master is explored in terms of forms, dimensions, materials, favored varnishes, and work methods.

To be sure, animals possess powerful survival instincts and do their best to avoid getting killed. But (so far as we know) they have no conscious knowledge of how little time they have here on earth. They go through life blissfully unaware that each passing day is bringing them closer and closer to the end. &nbsp; <br><br> Humans, on the other hand&#x2014;particularly as we grow older&#x2014;are all too keenly aware of how fleeting life is. On the plus side, this can add flavor and poignancy to our existence, making us savor the lovely and precious things in life (as the poet Wallace Stevens says, &#x201c;Death is the mother of beauty&#x201d;). But it also burdens us with a heavy load of anxiety and plagues us with the question &#x201c;Why do we have to die at all?&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br> From time immemorial, humans have grappled with this mystery. Tribal myths from around the world offer a host of colorful explanations. According to one African tale, when the first humans pleaded with God to stop death, he complied with their wishes, but only on one condition: to prevent the world from becoming too crowded, there would be no more births. Unwilling to endure life without children, the people quickly begged God to return death to them. &nbsp; <br><br>In an Indonesian myth, death came into the world when God offered the first man and woman a choice between two gifts: a stone and a banana. Seeing no use for the stone, the pair chose the enticing fruit. At that instant, a voice thundered down from heaven: &#x201c;Because you have chosen the banana, your life shall be like its life. When the banana tree has offspring, the parent stem dies. So shall you die and your children shall step into your place. Had you chosen the stone, your life would have been like its life, changeless and immortal.&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br> And then there is the Australian Aboriginal myth recorded by the anthropologists Ronald and Catherine Berndt. According to this story, two traveling companions named Moon and Djarbo suddenly fall mortally ill. Moon has a plan to revive them, but Djarbo&#x2014;believing that Moon&#x2019;s idea is a trick&#x2014;rebuffs his friend&#x2019;s help and soon dies. Moon dies also, but thanks to his plan he manages to revive himself into a new body every month, whereas Djarbo remains dead. &#x201c;Thus, Moon triumphed over bodily death while the first peoples of that ancient time followed Djarbo&#x2019;s example, and that is why all humans die.&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br>At first, people never died. As they grew older, they cast off their skins like snakes and crabs and came out with their youth renewed. One day, an elderly woman went to a stream to change her skin. She shed the old skin and threw it in the water, then watched as it floated downstream and caught on a stick. Then she went home, where she had left her little son. As soon as the child saw her, however, he began to cry because he did not recognize her. &#x201c;You are not my mother. My mother was an old woman.&#x201d; To pacify the child, the woman returned to the stream, found the cast-off skin, and put it back on. From that day on, humans ceased to shed their skin and died. &nbsp; &#x2014;Melanesian myth<br>&nbsp;<br> Of course, these fanciful stories can&#x2019;t be taken seriously. Clearly, they are the products of primitive, childlike minds&#x2014;nothing more than fairy tales. After all, the real truth, as every biblical fundamentalist will tell you, is that death came into the world when Satan in the form of a talking snake gave a forbidden apple to a naked woman created from the rib of her slumbering mate. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, some scientists reject even this persuasive explanation. As far back as the eighteenth century, the famed botanist Carl Linnaeus, father of modern taxonomy, accounted for death in ecological terms. As Linnaeus saw it, death served to maintain a fundamental balance in nature by ensuring that no single species of plant or animal would overrun the earth through unchecked reproduction. In the following century, Claude Bernard&#x2014;the founder of modern physiology&#x2014;viewed obsolescence and death as intrinsic characteristics of living beings, the flip side of embryonic development and birth. &#x201c;Existence,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;is nothing other than a perpetual alternation of life and death, composition and decomposition. There is no life without death; there is no death without life.&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br>The Bernardian belief that death is a biological necessity has been endorsed by subsequent thinkers, among them the German physician Wilhelm Fliess (one of Freud&#x2019;s early collaborators), who compared the human body to a &#x201c;wound up clock that carries within itself the law of its own unwinding.&#x201d; In a similar vein, the Hungarian psychologist Leopold Szondi coined the term thanatropism to describe &#x201c;an unknown force in every living being driving it toward death.&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br>At least one famous nineteenth-century scientist, however, took issue with the view of death as an inescapable aspect of life. The great German biologist August Weismann argued that, contrary to what most people assume, &#x201c;death is not an inevitable phenomenon.&#x201d; Some living beings, he insisted, can exist forever. As proof, he pointed to the case of unicellular organisms, which reproduce themselves by splitting in two and therefore enjoy a kind of immortality. &nbsp; <br><br>Clearly, this is an excellent state of affairs if you happen to be an amoeba. Even Weismann, however, acknowledged that higher organisms (including, sadly, human beings) cannot avoid death. &nbsp; <br><br>The concepts put forth by Weismann&#x2014;who is widely regarded as the most important evolutionary theorist of the nineteenth century after Darwin himself&#x2014;have contributed significantly to the current scientific understanding of death. Weismann distinguished between what he called the &#x201c;germ cells&#x201d;&#x2014;essentially the sperm and ova that carry our genes&#x2014;and the &#x201c;somatic cells&#x201d; that constitute our bodies. In this view, the body is nothing more than a vehicle for transmitting our genes to future generations. Once this task is accomplished&#x2014;once reproduction has taken place&#x2014;the body becomes disposable. There&#x2019;s no biological point in keeping it alive forever. In fact, there are positive advantages to getting rid of it, since the elimination of older individuals frees up important resources for the young and thus ensures the perpetuation of the species, which is all that nature cares about. &nbsp; <br><br>Of course, this doesn&#x2019;t entirely explain why humans have the potential to live to a ripe old age and don&#x2019;t simply expire as soon as they fulfill their reproductive mission, in the way of other creatures from praying mantises to salmon. Here, too, evolutionary biology suggests an answer. Thinkers who subscribe to this theory argue that since human offspring require years of parental care, we are genetically programmed to remain alive long past our reproductive prime so that we can protect our children and ensure their survival (scientists call this the &#x201c;grandmother effect&#x201d;). Thanks to our kids, we are endowed with &#x201c;post-reproductive longevity.&#x201d; So the next time you contemplate those college tuition payments, just remember: you may think those bills are killing you, but they&#x2019;re actually helping to keep you alive. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>RECOMMENDED READING<br>&nbsp;<br> Andrï¿½ Klarsfeld and Frï¿½dï¿½ric Revah&#x2019;s The Biology of Death: Origins of Mortality (Cornell University Press, 2004) is an excellent survey of scientific theories of death. Another is the first chapter of Jacques Choron&#x2019;s Modern Man and Mortality (Macmillan, 1964). George Wald, the eminent Harvard biologist who won the Nobel Prize in 1967, delivered an elegant and wonderfully lucid lecture on the origin of death, which can be found online at www.elijahwald.com/origin.html. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> In one sense, people in all times and places have felt pretty much the same about dying. Generally speaking, we&#x2019;d prefer not to. Apart from this natural desire to avoid death, however, there&#x2019;s no such thing as a single worldwide way of viewing mortality. Cultural attitudes have differed throughout time and across the globe. &nbsp; <br><br>Judging from the epic of Gilgamesh&#x2014;the world&#x2019;s oldest written narrative, which dates back to at least 1300 b.c.&#x2014;the ancient Babylonians conceived of the afterworld as the &#x201c;house of darkness,&#x201d; a grim subterranean realm where the dead exist in a state of unrelieved wretchedness. This view led them to adopt an eat-drink-and-be-merry philosophy, articulated in the story by a &#x201c;wine maiden&#x201d; named Siduri, who counsels the hero &#x201c;to make every day a day of rejoicing. Day and night do thou dance and play.&#x201d; In short, it was important for everyone, whether commoner or king, to make the most of his time on earth, since death was an unavoidable catastrophe&#x2014;the natural, universal (if dreadful) fate of humankind. &nbsp; <br><br> Among many aboriginal tribes, on the other hand, there is nothing at all natural about death. In this view, every death&#x2014;even that of an elderly person&#x2014;is essentially an act of murder brought about by witchcraft. Slain by a malevolent, unseen enemy, the victim is likely to return as a vengeful spirit. &nbsp; For the Kaingï¿½ng of Brazil, for example, the passing of any individual threatens the welfare of the entire tribe. Transformed into an evil &#x201c;ghost-soul,&#x201d; the deceased (in the words of funerary scholars Robert Habenstein and William Lamers) &#x201c;craves a companion from among the living.&#x201d; Surviving spouses are particularly vulnerable and will immediately decamp from the village, armed with a particular variety of large jungle fern&#x2014;a horticultural charm apparently much feared by ghost-souls. Only after the corpse is safely cremated and buried (in a hole lined with additional ferns to keep the malevolent spirit trapped inside) will the frightened survivor venture to return. &nbsp; <br><br> By contrast, Hindus view death not as an evil but as a natural stage in the evolution of the soul, which undergoes successive reincarnations until it attains salvation and is freed from the cycle of dying and rebirth. In the words of one sage: &#x201c;Our soul never dies; only the physical body dies. We neither fear death nor look forward to it, but revere it as a most exalted experience. Life, death and the afterlife are part of our path to perfect oneness with God.&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br>In Western society, views of death have changed dramatically over the millennia, as French social historian Philippe Ariï¿½s was the first to document. Ariï¿½s famously identified four distinct stages in European attitudes toward death, from the calm acceptance of the early medieval period to the denial and avoidance characteristic of the modern age. &nbsp; <br><br>American death attitudes have undergone major transformations since the days of the early colonists. For the New England Puritans, death was an omnipresent reality. Their median life expectancy was thirty-three, and the mortality rate among children was so high that, according to historian David Stannard, when a young couple in seventeenth-century Massachusetts got married, they &#x201c;did so with the knowledge and expectation that in all probability two or three of the children they might have would die before the age of ten.&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br> Their familiarity with death, however, did not make the contemplation of their own inevitable end any less anxiety-provoking. As Calvinists, they saw all humans (even newborns) as hopelessly depraved sinners, the vast majority of whom were predestined to spend eternity suffering the torments of hell. They might hope and pray for salvation. But to a very large degree, death remained the &#x201c;king of terrors.&#x201d; &nbsp; <br><br> Nor did they attach any sentimental value to the physical remains of their loved ones. As funeral historian Gary Laderman observes, to the Puritans &#x201c;the corpse was a horrible sight&#x201d; that symbolized human sin and corruption. Once the soul had departed, the body was just a vile lump of flesh, undeserving of any special treatment. Thus, the Puritans &#x201c;did not approve of embalming, elaborate funerals, or extravagant tombs.&#x201d; The newly dead corpse was &#x201c;hurried into the ground with little ceremony&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;commended to the cold and silent Grave where it must be entertained with Worms and Rottenness, and turned into putrefaction&#x201d; (as one Puritan divine so vividly put it). &nbsp; <br><br> By the mid-ï¿½nineteenth century, a far more romanticized attitude toward death had taken hold in the United States. Early Puritan graveyards were bleak, untended places, their stark tombstones carved with winged skulls, scythes, and other grim reminders of life&#x2019;s brevity. Beginning in the mid-1800s, picturesque &#x201c;garden cemeteries&#x201d; sprang up across the country: lush, rural burial grounds, as beautifully landscaped as any park and dotted with mawkish memorial statuary&#x2014;empty cradles and inconsolable pets and little children in peaceful repose. &nbsp; <br><br> Death became an occasion for sentimental excess. Ladies&#x2019; magazines devoted countless features to the latest in mourning fashions; women adorned themselves with &#x201c;hair jewelry&#x201d; made from the locks of their deceased loved ones; front parlors were hung with postmortem portraits and memorial lithographs of grieving survivors posed beside tombs and surrounded by weeping willow trees. Shamelessly sappy verse about the tragic deaths of toddlers became a wildly popular poetic genre. Heaven itself came to be seen differently: not as the place where one&#x2019;s soul received its final (and, for the vast majority of humans, dreadful) judgment but (to quote Stannard) as &#x201c;a domesticated haven, a place where all would be welcomed home&#x201d;&#x2014;a kind of celestial version of a comfortable, middle-class Victorian household. &nbsp; <br><br>As the Victorian age gave way to the modern era, powerful social factors&#x2014;urbanization, advances in medical science, the breakdown of tight-knit communities, a growing secular outlook that undermined the traditional faith in an afterlife&#x2014;caused another major shift in American death attitudes. The dead were segregated from the living, banished from sight. People no longer expired at home surrounded by their loved ones but died in sterile hospital rooms, tended by strangers. The elaborate mourning rituals of earlier times were abandoned, rendered obsolete by the feel-good ethos of contemporary U.S. consumer culture (what sociologists Nathan Leites and Martha Wolfenstein call American &#x201c;fun morality&#x201d;). Funerals became, in the caustic phrase of sociologist Robert Fulton, &#x201c;low-grief&#x201d; affairs. With the spread of &#x201c;perpetual care&#x201d; cemeteries, visiting the final resting places of departed family members to pay respects and tend their graves became an increasingly quaint and outmoded custom. &nbsp; <br><br>Death itself became a taboo topic, something not to be dwelled upon or even spoken of. In her excellent book, Death&#x2019;s Door: Modern Dying and the Ways We Grieve (Norton, 2006), Sandra Gilbert relates an anecdote that perfectly captures the extent to which death has become an unmentionable subject in our time. In the mid-1990s, while compiling a book called Confronting Death, sociologist David Moller asked the American Cancer Society for pe...</p><h2>Land Of Promise (Counter-Caliphate Chronicles)</h2><p><p><i>New York Times</i> Bestselling author James Wesley, Rawles's Land of Promise is a bold piece of speculative fiction that posits the establishment of a Christian nation of refuge, in response to the establishment of a global Islamic Caliphate in the near future.

To get that nice, crunchy texture, I avoid cutting it into thin slices. Seedy slices weep, making the eggs watery. Instead, I cut a halved squash into larger chunks. That reduces the moisture it releases and keeps the squash crisp when nestled in the creamy eggs. <br> &nbsp;<br> 6 large eggs <br> Coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper <br> 2 teaspoons chia seeds <br> 4 tablespoons grass-fed unsalted butter, cut into small pieces <br> 1&#x2044;4 cup thinly sliced leeks (white and pale green parts only) <br> 1 small summer squash, such as zucchini, halved lengthwise and cut into 3&#x2044;4-inch chunks at angles <br> 1&#x2044;4 teaspoon champagne vinegar <br> 1&#x2044;4 cup fresh curly parsley, chopped <br> 1&#x2044;4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped Espelette pepper or pimentï¿½n (smoked sweet paprika) <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Beat the eggs in a large bowl with a fork until a little bubbly but still retaining some white streaks. Season with salt and black pepper, then fold in the chia seeds and 2 tablespoons of the butter. Let stand so the chia seeds can plump while you prepare the vegetables. <br><br> Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, the leeks, and the squash. Season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute. Add the vinegar and let it cook off, then add the egg mixture. <br><br> Use a silicone spatula to stir and scrape the set eggs around the edges of the pan into the wet center, then let them sit for a minute. They should start to set. Add the parsley and cilantro and fold well until the eggs are moist but not runny, 1 to 2 minutes. <br><br> Remove from the heat and sprinkle with Espelette.

Some things could not be rushed. Patience and preparation were necessary for the successful completion of even the most routine professional killings. Such jobs could be considered routine only because of the preparation that went into them and the patience displayed in their execution. If corners were cut in the lead-up to the job&#x2014;should any contingency not be considered and planned for&#x2014;mistakes would surely follow. Mistakes would also occur if the job was undertaken with anything less than the requisite calm and diligence. In this instance, considering the target, adherence to these two protocols was not only necessary but imperative.</p><p>He was a man somewhere in his mid-thirties, but maybe older, maybe younger. It was hard to be sure because almost all of the intel on him was unverified. It was either speculation or hearsay, rumor or guesswork. He had no name. He had no residence. No friends or family. His background was nonexistent. He was not a politician or drug baron or war criminal. He was not military or intelligence&#x2014;at least actively serving&#x2014;but he could not be called a civilian either. The only thing that was known with any certainty was his profession. He was a killer. The client had referred to him as <i>the </i>killer, warning that he had recently dispatched another team sent after him. If a book had been written on the art of professional assassination, he would have authored it. No such book existed, of course. If it had, the team getting ready to murder him would have memorized every word.</p><p>He had an unremarkable appearance. He was tall, but no giant. He had dark hair and eyes. The team&#x2019;s women could not decide if he was handsome or not. He dressed like a lawyer or banker in good-quality suits, though ones that were a little too big for his frame. When first they saw him he had been clean-shaven, but he now sported a few days&#x2019; beard growth. The only notable thing about him was his slight limp, as he favored his right leg over the left. Not severe enough to take advantage of, they agreed.</p><p>A million euros sat in a Swiss escrow account. It was theirs upon providing proof of the killer&#x2019;s death. His intact head, preferably, or at the very least irrefutable photographic or video evidence.</p><p>They were a tight quartet&#x2014;two men and two women. All Scandinavians: two Danes, a Swede, and a Finn. They had worked together for years. Always the four of them. Never using anyone else. Never operating if any of them could not be present. They were friends as well as colleagues. It was the only way to guarantee trust in the business of contracted killing. When they were not working, they socialized whenever they could. They took turns hosting the others for barbecues, dinner parties, and movie nights. They had been more than friends at various times, but those times had passed. Interteam relations were bad for business, they had eventually agreed. Their assignments were inherently dangerous. They could not afford to be distracted.</p><p>There was no leader because they each had unique skills and talents and therefore inherent superiority in their own fields of expertise. When a bomb was used it was used under the instruction of the Danish demolitions expert, who named his devices after former lovers. When performing a long-range kill the Finnish woman, who had the most rifle experience, held seniority. When poison was required the Swedish chemist made the decisions in his authoritarian baritone. When shadowing a target the second Dane, who was an exceptional actress and knew the most about surveillance techniques, gave the orders. They operated democratically when no single team member held obvious authority. The arrangement worked well. Egos were kept in check. Jobs ran smoothly. No one got hurt&#x2014;except the target. And never more than they were paid to be. The Scandinavians were not sadists. Except when they were hired to be.</p><p>It had been a unanimous conclusion that today they could only wait. The target was even more difficult to corner than they had been led to believe from the intel provided. He had no idea he was under surveillance, but his routine preventative measures bordered on the obsessive. Yet he was smart to use them. He was, after all, being hunted, and so far had given the team no opportunity to strike. Not only was he reputed to be an exceptional killer, but he was also proving exceptionally hard to kill. A good combination of talents, they all agreed, similarly agreeing that they should adopt some of his precautions into their own repertoire when this was over. Like him, maybe one day they would find themselves on the wrong end of a contract.</p><p>He was staying in a grand hotel in the city&#x2019;s central district. Aside from the main entrance, the hotel had three other ways in and out. They could watch them all, given their number, but in doing so spread themselves out too thinly to act when he showed. He never departed via the same exit nor returned through the same entrance twice in a row&#x2014;until he did, obliterating any chance they had at predicting his next choice. The Finn, who was something of a statistician in addition to being an accomplished sniper, snapped a pencil in annoyance.</p><p>The target had a deluxe guestroom on the second floor. He had also booked the room next to it. That made it problematic to know in which he slept. The door that joined the two rooms made it impossible. It seemed he slept during the daytime. At least, he spent most of his time at the hotel during daylight hours, though never for a duration that would be conducive to a proper sleep pattern. The single longest period of time he could be verifiably in either of his rooms was five hours. Often he was in the hotel considerably longer, whether in the bar, restaurant, fitness center, or just reading a newspaper in the lobby. He never arrived at or left the hotel at anything close to the same time. The only habit he showed was in opting for the stairs, never the elevator, despite the limp.</p><p>Not that the hotel was a good strike point. The rooms he&#x2019;d booked were located near the elevators, where foot traffic was common. They had little to no chance of orchestrating a kill without the interruption of other guests. It was hard not to become frustrated. They were used to choosing where and when to finish a job, not having their target decide for them where not to make it. They kept their annoyance in check, reminding one another to stay cool. This was all to be expected. Preparation and patience.</p><p>He appeared to have no routine outside the hotel. Sometimes he patronized street vendors peddling artery-clogging junk food. At other times he dined in restaurants serving the most exquisite and expensive cuisine. One afternoon he might spend several hours browsing exhibits in a single museum. The next he&#x2019;d read a book, moving from cafï¿½ to cafï¿½ with it, never staying in any one establishment for more than an hour at a time, and sometimes for only a matter of minutes. When they had figured him so impersonal as to be almost a recluse, he then spent an evening charming women in a cocktail bar.</p><p>He had no mobile phone, but at what the Finn deemed random intervals he used Internet cafï¿½s or pay phones. They found no traces of his activities when the Danish surveillance specialist then used the same terminal or phone booth. They debated whether such activities were even necessary for him or if they were merely for show, to trip up and distract any undetected tail.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s working,&#x201d; the Swede said.</p><p>They had no idea why he was present in the city. It could be for any number of reasons. Perhaps he was preparing for a job of his own, getting to know the city and his area of operations. Maybe he was on the run and keeping incognito where he hoped his enemies could not find him. Or could this even be how he lived day-to-day when he was not himself working? It was no life, they all agreed, however many zeroes he could command for his services. If every waking moment had to be spent in a perpetual sense of alertness, then there had to be better ways to make a living. It made them appreciate how fortunate they were. They looked forward to this job&#x2019;s completion and their next get-together. It was the Swede&#x2019;s turn to host and his wife was universally adored. She taught physics but could be a professional party planner, as they would often tell the Swede to his pride.</p><p>A hit on the move proved just as troublesome to organize as one based on location. The target used buses, taxis, subways, aboveground trains, and walking with no discernible pattern. Distances were irrelevant. He might walk three miles to visit a coffee shop, yet take a cab for two blocks or spend an hour on the subway only to exit via the same station. How much the limp bothered him on such journeys, they could not tell.</p><p>In open areas he stayed in crowds and never walked in straight lines. When on narrow streets he kept away from the curb and close to storefronts. His hands were always outside his pockets. When he drank coffee on the move he did so by holding the cup in his left hand.</p><p>&#x201c;So his primary hand is always available,&#x201d; the Finn observed.</p><p>&#x201c;What if he&#x2019;s ambidextrous?&#x201d; one of the Danes asked.</p><p>The Finn replied, &#x201c;Less than a one percent chance of that. For all we know, he uses his left hand to make observers think he&#x2019;s left-handed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s assume he is ambidextrous,&#x201d; the second Dane said. &#x201c;Whatever hand is occupied, we consider him just as dangerous.&#x201d;</p><p>The other three nodded.</p><p>They operated from a vehicle that was changed daily, renting a different van each morning. They would take turns sleeping in the back compartment while the others worked. They had multiple changes of clothes and other accessories to make sure he never recognized who followed him on foot. Sometimes they lost him in order to maintain their cover, but that was to be expected. <i>Take no risks</i>, they would tell one another. They knew he would return to the hotel at some point, because the Danish surveillance expert had hacked into the hotel&#x2019;s registry system. They knew how long he was staying, how much he was paying for the two rooms, even what he ordered from room service and that he had requested feather-free bedding and smoking rooms.</p><p>&#x201c;But he hasn&#x2019;t smoked a single cigarette in all the time we&#x2019;ve watched him,&#x201d; the Swede noted.</p><p>&#x201c;No assumptions,&#x201d; the Finn reminded him. &#x201c;This guy&#x2019;s only consistency is inconsistency.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sound like you respect him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a lion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A lion?&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded and grinned. &#x201c;His head will look great mounted above my fireplace.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Two days later the voice of the female Dane, who was one of the pair shadowing on foot, sounded through the speaker of the mobile radio unit set up in the back of the rental van.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s buying camping supplies.&#x201d;</p><p>The Swede pressed the SEND button on the radio control panel and spoke into the microphone. &#x201c;What kind of supplies are we talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A stove, solid fuel, waterproof sleeping bag, bungee cords, padded sleeping mats, a walking cane&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. items like that. I can&#x2019;t see everything he&#x2019;s loaded into the trolley.&#x201d;</p><p>The Finn was also shadowing, but currently outside the store. Her distinctive red hair was hidden beneath a wig. &#x201c;Any cold-weather gear?&#x201d;</p><p>The Swede waited for the Dane to respond when there was no danger of being observed. After a moment&#x2019;s silence she answered, &#x201c;Not from what I can see. Shall I get closer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maintain a safe distance,&#x201d; the Swede replied. &#x201c;This could be a ruse to draw out potential surveillance. We make no assumptions about this guy. Take no risks. Okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;</p><p>The Finn said, &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s planning for a job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be certain of that,&#x201d; the Swede replied.</p><p>She responded without pause because while outside the store there was no danger of being exposed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not going camping for the fun of it. I know that much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t be sure he is going camping.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Talk quieter,&#x201d; the male Dane said, and rolled over.</p><p>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½</p><p>The next day was the same: more waiting. During that time they had witnessed him buying used mobile phones from a market trader and top-up credit from two different stores. The Finn had point for the foot surveillance. She enjoyed watching the target from relatively close proximity. She enjoyed pitting her skills at remaining unseen against such a careful mark. She didn&#x2019;t take risks, of course, however much she wanted to impress the others. Particularly the Swede, who aroused her and frustrated her in equal measure in those moments when she did not think of her boyfriend or the Swede&#x2019;s lovely wife.</p><p>The Finn wanted to be the one that ended this. Not necessarily with the kill itself, but by providing that advantage they had so far struggled to acquire. Perhaps if she did not lose the target, as the others often did, she would be led to somewhere that could be used as a strike point, or learn some extra intelligence that they could exploit to create one.</p><p>Gunning him down on the street wasn&#x2019;t their style. They wanted to live free and enjoy their hefty tax-free commissions. It was rare they even left a body behind. A combination of the Swede&#x2019;s cocktails of flesh-dissolving enzymes and acids and the Finn&#x2019;s willingness to use power tools ensured that after they had made a kill, not enough of the target remained to be identified. They charged extra for such cleanup, but would do it regardless. The Finn kept her thrill at putting to use circular saws and belt sanders a secret from the other three. As a girl, gutting reindeer had always been her favorite part of hunting with her father.</p><p>She inspected such tools while following the target around a hardware and DIY superstore. They had on sale a handheld circular saw produced by her preferred manufacturer. It had a 1900 mm blade and used 1300 watts of power. Fun times could be had with that, providing one wore the right protective clothing. So much mess.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s bought himself an oxyacetylene torch,&#x201d; she whispered into her lapel mike. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good one too.&#x201d;</p><p>The deep, sweet voice of the Swede responded in her ear: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this guy up to? I know you&#x2019;re going to say he&#x2019;s preparing for a job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s building something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But what?&#x201d; the Swede said in return.</p><p>She kept the target at the limits of her sight and observed as he added a set of protective goggles, fuel tank, and heavy-duty gloves to use with the cutting torch. He then went on to buy a small generator, diesel, and a folding four-wheel trolley to transport his purchases. At the till, he spent a minute flirting with the much older woman who served him. The smile that lingered on her face long after he&#x2019;d gone told the Finn she had enjoyed the experience.</p><p>The Finn didn&#x2019;t follow the target outside. She updated the Swede on his new acquisitions, and the Danish man was put into rotation, wearing smart business clothes&#x2014;the opposite of the casual jeans and leather jacket he&#x2019;d worn the previous day. Though arguably ...</p></p><h2>Metagenealogy: Self-Discovery through Psychomagic and the Family Tree</h2><p>A practical guide to recognizing and overcoming the patterns and influences of the four generations before you <br> <br>ï¿½ Provides exercises to uncover your family&#x2019;s psychological heritage, heal negative patterns of behavior and illness in your family tree, and discover your true self <br> <br>ï¿½ Explains how we are the product of two forces: repetition of familial patterns from the past and creation of new ideas from the Universal Consciousness of the future <br> <br>ï¿½ Interwoven with examples from Jodorowsky&#x2019;s own life and his work with the tarot, psychoanalysis, and psychomagic <br> <br>The family tree is not merely vital statistics about your ancestors. It is an embodied sense of self that we inherit from at least four prior generations, constituting both a life-giving treasure and a deadly trap. Each of us is both an heir of our lineage and a necessary variation that brings the family into new territory. Are you doomed to repeat the patterns of your parents and grandparents? Or can you harness your familial and individual talents to create your own destiny? <br> <br>In <i>Metagenealogy</i>, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Marianne Costa show how every individual is the product of two forces: the imitating force, directed by the family group acting from the past, and the creative force, driven by the Universal Consciousness from the future. Interweaving examples from Jodorowsky&#x2019;s own life and his work with the tarot, psychoanalysis, and psychomagic, the authors provide exercises, visualizations, and meditations to discover your family&#x2019;s psychological heritage and open yourself to the growth and creativity of Universal Consciousness. They reveal how identifying the patterns, emotional programming, and successes and failures of the four generations that influence you--your siblings, parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and great-grandparents--allows you to see beyond the stable identity formed by family lineage. It frees you to overcome your inherited subconscious patterns of behavior and illness, stop the transmission of these patterns to future generations, and reconnect with your true self and unique creative purpose in life. <br> <br>By understanding your family tree and your place in it, you open your ability to heal the ancient struggle between the repetitive forces of the past and the creative forces of the future.</p><p>Alejandro Jodorowsky is the legendary filmmaker of <i>El Topo</i> and <i>The Holy Mountain</i>.

Indeed, upon my servants and my handmaids I will pour out a portion of my spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy. And I will work wonders in the heavens above, and signs on the earth below: blood, fire, and a cloud of smoke. The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the coming of that great and glorious day of the Lord. Then shall everyone be saved who calls on the name of the Lord. <br>Acts 2: 17-21 <br>In the rural hamlet of Medjugorje, nestled in the mountains of southwestern Yugoslavia, where Marxist-Leninism was once the state-imposed Communist regime, the Blessed Mother of Jesus Christ appeared quite suddenly one evening to two teenager girls. Shocked, frightened, and confused, they fled. Later that same evening, June 24, 1981, the two girls and several other teenagers again saw the Blessed Virgin Mary at the same place, Mount Podbrdo, now known as Apparition Hill. This time she was holding the Infant Jesus. Several claim she called to them and they heard her, and that they saw her and the Child quite clearly, though the distance was at least three soccer fields away. Such a humble beginning augured what may be the most profound and important series of apparitions in history, for the Blessed Mother says this is her last apparition on earth in this way. Twenty-five years later she continues to appear daily to three of the original visionaries. She has given ten secrets that allegedly contain the final chapters in the history of the world. She states, according to the visionaries, that after the secrets are fulfilled, she will not need to come to earth again. <br>The place of the apparitions, which have occurred daily since 1981, is fraught with a violent, bloodstained history that goes back at least one thousand years. It contains scars of such violence to this day. The Blessed Mother tells the visionaries: <br>I am the Queen of Peace <br>I am the Mother of God <br>I am the Mother of All People on Earth <br>They say she appears standing on a cloud wearing a gray dress, a white veil, and a crown of twelve stars. The cloud itself is significant in that never have the visionaries seen her feet or shoes. Her contact with the bloodstained earth is six young people who became the visionaries of Medjugorje: Mirjana Dragicevic Soldo, Ivanka Ivankovic Elez, Ivan Dragicevic, Marija Pavlovic Lunetti, Jacov Colo, and Vicka Ivankovic Mijatovic (no relation to Ivanka). <br>Are these the last days? Does mankind stand on the abyss of self-extinction? Is that what the Blessed Mother comes to tell the world? The weapons for such a cataclysm exist. Kindergarten children have seen the means of their own global annihilation on the television screen as death and destruction have exploded for years in the Middle East. Yet the Blessed Mother calls herself the Queen of Peace. The visionaries say she is so beautiful that there are no words to describe her. They say she is &#x201c;pure love.&#x201d; The appearance of &#x201c;pure love&#x201d; juxtaposed with a region so bloody produces a dramatic contrast. The area itself is harsh. The people, for the most part, give evidence in their demeanor of the lived memories of oppression and deprivation. <br>Medjugorje means &#x201c;Between the Mountains,&#x201c; and so it is. Thousands of years ago the sea covered the valley that separates the ranges. Here in the poorest, most economically undeveloped region of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the earth itself is often stony and stingy. Though tobacco and grapes have been harvested since the Middle Ages, the crop yield is never abundant. Currency was in such short supply at the time of the first apparition that it was standard for the able-bodied men to labor as migrant workers in West Germany or Italy, while the women and children kept the fields and the animals.1 The hard currency the men were able to earn abroad bought cars and televisions, indoor bathrooms, and even washing machines. <br>The great-grandmothers of the village still dress in the traditional black garb of widows, since most are indeed widows. World War II took its toll on the older men, and those who survived were often debilitated by excessively hard work and malnutrition. Assets that were desirable in Medjugorje, as recently as 1981, were sheep, cows, chickens, donkeys, and goats, which would wander over the dirt roads. The women and children tended the animals in this village of four hundred families, who live in small stucco houses with red roofs. Each has a little garden, but the land is rarely fertile. The great-grandfathers, who are the increasingly few survivors of World War II, find joy for the most part in rest. Many spend their summers sitting in the hot sun silently staring at life around them; in winter they sit by the woodstove or play cards and drink schnapps. And some do work in the fields. With growth and development of the shrine, fewer and fewer local homes lack modern equipment and heating. Farming is giving way to commerce. <br>For seven hundred years, the people have had a Lenten tradition of fasting on only bread and water. This tradition dates back to the days when Saint Francis of Assisi sent his first group of missionaries to Herzegovina and on to Medjugorje. The church has been the center of village life ever since. Saint James Church is large, with twin towers. It holds about sixteen hundred people. Behind the church, across the fields, stands Cross Mountain, thirteen hundred meters high and dotted with fourteen Stations of the Cross erected along a rocky and treacherous path that culminates at the summit where a high, gray concrete cross was erected by the villagers in 1933. <br>The concrete cross was constructed to commemorate the nineteen hundredth anniversary of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. There is a practical purpose to the cross. Since its erection, the devastating hailstorms that had bombarded the village, bringing destruction and death, have stopped. A popular legend in Medjugorje has it that Pope Pius XI had a dream in which an angel commanded him to have a high cross erected on Mount Sipovac. It is then by Pontifical Commission that Mount Sipovac became the recipient of the high cross built by the villagers, who changed not only the name of the mountain to Mount Krizevac (Cross Mountain) but the very course of their lives.2 <br>Opposite Mount Krizevac is another, smaller mountain known as Podbrdo. This is where the Blessed Virgin Mary first appeared to two teenage girls as they walked along a dusty road in the area of Bijakovici. They were friends of long standing. Fifteen-year-old Ivanka Ivankovic lived in Mostar but spent summers with her grandparents in Bijakovici, where her family owned a small vineyard. Mirjana Dragicevic, sixteen, who lived in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, also spent summers with her grandmother in Bijakovici. <br>On the feast day of Saint John the Baptist, June 24, 1981, a mysterious light hovered over the small mountain (Mount Podbrdo) in Medjugorje. In that brilliant light, the two teenagers saw a beautiful woman holding an infant whom she was uncovering to show to them. Incredulous, they heard her call to them. They fled in fear. <br>The young girls talked to their friends, and a group of them returned to the foot of the mountain. There she was! They wondered if she could really be the Blessed Virgin Mary. They all ran away in terror. &#x201c;Why would she come here?&#x201d; the young people&#x2019;s families asked. &#x201c;You are not holy,&#x201c; someone thundered at Ivan, sixteen, who was in the group who saw. &#x201c;How dare you suggest you have seen the Mother of God! It&#x2019;s blasphemy!&#x201d; various members of the families challenged. <br>Sixteen-year-old Vicka, also one of the group, has a mother who was more sympathetic. &#x201c;Did you really see the Virgin?&#x201d; she asked. Vicka was so certain that she said she was ready to die, if it should come to that, rather than deny the apparition. <br>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s the devil. Sometimes he disguises himself as an angel of light to fool people,&#x201c; said Vicka&#x2019;s wise old grandmother. <br>&#x201c;How would I know?&#x201d; asked Vicka. &#x201c;She was so beautiful! I know she was from heaven.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If you ever see her again, take holy water and throw it at the apparition. The devil can&#x2019;t stand holy water. Then you&#x2019;ll know for sure,&#x201c; Vicka&#x2019;s grandmother asserted. Soon everyone was talking.3 <br>Vicka&#x2019;s neighbor Marinko gave Vicka and her friend Marija a ride to school the next morning. As they drove past the parish church of Saint James, Marija quietly said, &#x201c;Marinko, Vicka and some others saw the Blessed Mother last night.&#x201d; <br>Marinko laughed. &#x201c;Teenage girls and all their fantasies,&#x201c; he mumbled. &#x201c;Too early for jokes.&#x201d; <br>It was five a.m. Marinko&#x2019;s wife looked hard at Vicka, who was silent. For Vicka that was strange. She was known for her forthright, opinionated chatter. On June 25, 1981, Vicka seemed unaware of everybody in the car. Marinko&#x2019;s wife asked, &#x201c;Did you see the Blessed Virgin Mary, Vicka?&#x201d; <br>Suddenly Vicka&#x2019;s eyes blazed. &#x201c;I did. It was the Blessed Mother. And she held the baby Jesus, too. She was showing Him to us.&#x201d; <br>Marinko had had enough. &#x201c;Who else was with you, Vicka?&#x201d; he asked. <br>&#x201c;Ivanka and Mirjana and Milka [Marija&#x2019;s sister] and Ivan,&#x201c; Vicka said. <br>&#x201c;Ivan Dragicevic?&#x201d; Marinko interrupted. <br>&#x201c;Yes, Ivan Dragicevic,&#x201c; said Vicka. <br>&#x201c;If Ivan says he saw the Virgin, I might believe you, Vicka,&#x201c; said Marinko. &#x201c;Ivan! Amazing, he&#x2019;s not the kind who would have fantasies like you foolish girls.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How I would love to be where the Blessed Mother is,&#x201c; Marija sighed. &#x201c;Just to be near her would be enough for m...</p></p><h2>From Sacrament to Contract, Second Edition: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition</h2><p><p>This newly revised and enlarged edition of John Witte's authoritative historical study explores the interplay of law, theology, and marriage in the Western tradition. Witte uncovers the core beliefs that formed the theological genetic code of Western marriage and family law. He explores the systematic models of marriage developed by Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, and Enlightenment thinkers, and the transformative influence of each model on Western marriage law. In addition, he traces the millennium-long reduction of marriage from a complex spiritual, social, contractual, and natural institution into a simple private contract with freedom of entrance, exercise, and exit for husband and wife alike.</p> <p>This second edition updates and expands each chapter and the bibliography.

Number Twelve River Road.&#x201d;<br><br>Wade MacGregor hoisted the squirming child onto his shoulders. Delighted to be released from the car seat where he&#x2019;d spent way too much time over the past few days, the little boy kicked his feet in the air, wanting down more than he wanted up. &#x201c;Hasn&#x2019;t changed a whole heck of a lot since then.&#x201d;<br><br>Wade studied the exterior of the house for a long moment. &#x201c;Looks like there have been a few changes in some of the trim color there around the porch. Aunt Berry always likes to keep up with the latest trends. Must always be on the cutting edge, you know?&#x201d;<br><br>He paused momentarily to stare at the fence that ran across the front of the property. He wondered when the fence had been installed, and why. No one had mentioned it in recent phone calls.<br><br>Then again, there were things he hadn&#x2019;t mentioned, either.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go check out the river. See the water?&#x201d; Wade crossed the broad lawn to the wooden pier in long strides, fully aware that he was procrastinating. &#x201c;Right down here is where I learned to fish and canoe and row and crab and do all kinds of fun things.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked up into the face of the dark-haired cherub whose heels kicked gleefully into his chest.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I suspect you&#x2019;ll be wanting to do those things one day, too. I&#x2019;ll teach you whenever you&#x2019;re ready,&#x201d; Wade told him. &#x201c;I promised your mama that I&#x2019;d raise you the best I could. I can&#x2019;t think of any better place for you to spend your summers than right here in St. Dennis, just like I did.&#x201d;<br><br>A sleek boat passed by, kicking up some wake as it headed toward the mouth of the New River, where it met the Chesapeake Bay.<br><br>&#x201c;Someday soon, we&#x2019;ll go sailing out there. You&#x2019;ll like that. We&#x2019;ll have to get you a little life jacket first, though.&#x201d; Wade thought for a moment. &#x201c;Your mama loved the water. That&#x2019;s one thing you&#x2019;ll want to know about her when you get older. She loved to swim and water-ski and dive. Maybe one day you&#x2019;ll want to do those things, too. She wanted to teach you herself, but that&#x2019;s not going to happen now.&#x201d; Wade swallowed the lump that threatened to close his throat. &#x201c;I know you miss her, buddy. I miss her, too . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Overhead a gull drifted, and attracted by something on the dock, dropped down onto one of the pilings to get a better look. It hopped to the deck, pecked at something solid for a moment, then took flight, the unexpected prize held in its beak. The bird changed direction, and angled back toward the Bay. Wade followed it with his eyes until it disappeared.<br><br>&#x201c;Ring-billed gull,&#x201d; Wade said aloud. &#x201c;Not to be con?fused with the herring gull. Someday you&#x2019;ll know the difference. Someday you&#x2019;ll know all the shorebirds.&#x201d;<br><br>Figuring he&#x2019;d gotten about all he was going to get out of his efforts to put off the inevitable, he glanced over his shoulder at the house.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I guess it&#x2019;s time to face the music.&#x201d; He started back across the lawn. &#x201c;You ready to meet your aunt Dallas and your cousin Cody and your great-great-aunt Berry?&#x201d;<br><br>The back door opened and a golden retriever sped out, a fluffy white dog on its heels, both barking wildly at the intruders.<br><br>&#x201c;Fleur!&#x201d; A little boy of six or seven raced after the dogs. &#x201c;Ally! Stop! Come back!&#x201d;<br><br>The dogs continued to run toward Wade.<br><br>&#x201c;See doggie!&#x201d; The toddler demanded and struggled to get down. &#x201c;Wanna see doggie!&#x201d;<br><br>Wade stood stock-still, waiting to see just how close the dogs would come, if they&#x2019;d continue to bark, and if they&#x2019;d show signs of real aggression.<br><br>&#x201c;Ally! Fleur!&#x201d; The boy ran after them and caught up with them when they stopped about ten feet from Wade.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Cody,&#x201d; Wade said. &#x201c;Do you remember me?&#x201d;<br><br>Cody narrowed his eyes and searched Wade&#x2019;s face momentarily before a smile appeared.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re my uncle Wade,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You live in Texas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not anymore.&#x201d; Wade gestured to the dogs, who had calmed down a little. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t bite, do they?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nah.&#x201d; The boy shook his head. &#x201c;They just act tough. Mom says they think they&#x2019;re Dobermans or rottweilers or something.&#x201d;<br><br>Wade laughed. &#x201c;Where is your mom?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s in the house. She didn&#x2019;t say you were coming today.&#x201d; Cody pointed to Austin, who was trying to wiggle out of Wade&#x2019;s grasp to get to the ground. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cody, this is Austin.&#x201d; Wade lifted the toddler in an arc over his head and placed him on his feet on the grass. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s your cousin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Austin.&#x201d; Cody knelt down in front of Austin, who pointed a chubby finger at the dogs, who approached cautiously, wagging their tales. &#x201c;Austin, this is Ally. She&#x2019;s Aunt Berry&#x2019;s dog. And this one&#x201d;&#x2014;he pointed to the white dog&#x2014;&#x201c;is Fleur. She&#x2019;s mine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here, doggie!&#x201d; Austin chortled as the golden retriever drew closer.<br><br>Cody glanced up at Wade. &#x201c;My mom didn&#x2019;t tell me I had a little cousin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your mom doesn&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boy, will she be surprised.&#x201d; Cody commanded the dogs to sit, then led Austin to them.<br><br>&#x201c;Boy, will she ever,&#x201d; Wade muttered.<br><br>A woman started around the side of the house, her pale blond hair pulled back in a ponytail, her dark glasses obscuring half her face.<br><br>&#x201c;Cody, who are you talking&#x2014;&#x201d; she began, then stopped in her tracks. &#x201c;Wade?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Dallas.&#x201d; Wade walked to meet his sister as she started toward him. &#x201c;We were just on our way up to the house when Cody and his furry friends came out to greet us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You stinker! You didn&#x2019;t tell us you were coming home this week!&#x201d; Dallas MacGregor wrapped her arms around him and hugged tightly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking good, kiddo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking even better.&#x201d; Wade hugged her in return and spun her halfway around before setting her down. &#x201c;St. Dennis agrees with you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you let us know you were coming? And what&#x2019;s with the trailer?&#x201d; She pointed to the drive, where Wade&#x2019;s Jeep sat with a trailer hooked up to the back. &#x201c;You hauling your beer in there? Expanding your business to the Chesapeake?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, I closed the business. I sold the equipment and the building.&#x201d;<br><br>Dallas&#x2019;s jaw dropped. When she recovered, she asked, &#x201c;What happened? Your brewery was doing so well. All those awards you won . . . I thought you were really solid.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were. It&#x2019;s a long story, Dallas.&#x201d;<br><br>Wade looked away. He&#x2019;d been dreading this conversation for weeks. He&#x2019;d been so proud of Kenne?Mac, the brewery he&#x2019;d started from scratch with his best friend from college. He&#x2019;d hated closing it down, but hated the idea of selling it even more. The company name&#x2014;that had been his and Robin&#x2019;s. His brew?ing secrets had taken him years to perfect. ?Kenne?Mac Brews had been the best part of his life for the past eight years. Giving it up was one thing.

It&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; Wade&#x2019;s smile was genuine. He adored his great-aunt. She&#x2019;d been the indulgent grandmother he hadn&#x2019;t known and Auntie Mame all in one. He counted the years he&#x2019;d lived with her as some of the best of his life.<br><br>She came down the porch steps, holding on, he noticed, to the railing all the way. She was always so spry, so clever and lively, he often forgot that she&#x2019;d turned eighty-one on her last birthday and had another approaching. He quickened his step so that she wouldn&#x2019;t have to walk across the entire yard to greet him.<br><br>&#x201c;You are a sight for these old eyes, Wade MacGregor.&#x201d; She hugged him fiercely. &#x201c;How dare you stay away for so long.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What was I thinking?&#x201d; He embraced her gently.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be damned if I know.&#x201d; She stood back and held him at arm&#x2019;s length. &#x201c;You look more and more like your father every year.

We learn of the correspondences they kept with their equally passionate colleagues and come to understand the unique collaborative climate that fostered virtuoso discoveries in the areas of medicine, astronomy, mathematics, biology, chemistry, botany, geography, and engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ingenious Pursuits</b> brilliantly chronicles the true intellectual revolution that continues to shape our very understanding of ourselves, and of the world around us.</p><p>Even Einstein had to eat. We seem to forget that scientists live in the same world as the rest of us, and that their work is informed by everything they encounter day to day. Lisa Jardine explores this interconnectedness in the context of the late 17th-century scientific revolution in <i>Ingenious Pursuits</i>, a well-planned journey back in time that delivers precious insight into the lives of those who laid the groundwork for cloning, nuclear weapons, and Internet commerce. Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Gian Domenico Cassini are just a few of the multitalented explorers that Jardine profiles through diaries, letters, and scientific records. Taking the time to fully flesh out the lives of these adventurous spirits, she shows the reader that science began as a natural curiosity about the material world, inspired by diverse interests: art, religion, medicine, engineering, and more.<p> Political meddling in science is nothing new; even 300 years ago rulers competed for knowledge and the status that came from scientific achievement. Jardine expands on this premise to see the colonial expansion of the time as a driving force behind research, responsible for the contemporary explosions in cartography, botany, and optics. While <i>Ingenious Pursuits</i> stays for the most part in the 17th century, it does remind us of our own interwoven scientific and social threads, and that perhaps the next revolutionary breakthrough will come about as much because of telemarketers as National Science Foundation grants. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Lisa Jardine is Professor of Renaissance Studies at Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, and Honorary Fellow of King&#39;s College, Cambridge.</p><h2>English Women&#39;s Clothing in the Nineteenth Century: A Comprehensive Guide with 1,117 Illustrations (Dover Fashion and Costumes)</h2><p>The nineteenth century was a period of continuous change for women's clothing in England. The growing prosperity of the merchant class meant an ever-larger number of women for whom "dress" was a principal function in life, while the increasing availability of lower-priced ready-made garments enabled women of moderate means to purchase the fashions of the day. In addition, the development of the railways spurred the spread of new goods, while the removal of the tax on papers in 1854 produced an abundance of fashion magazines at cheap prices, bringing news of the latest styles to the multitudes.<br>The magnificent array of ladies' fashions that characterized the century are on display in this remarkably complete decade-by-decade overview. Drawing almost exclusively on contemporary sources &#x2014; fashion magazines, newspapers, rare period photographs, memoirs, Victorian novels, periodicals, and other publications, as well as firsthand observation of actual garments &#x2014; the author describes and explains the couture that evolved in response to changing social conditions, technological innovations, and cultural developments.<br>Over 1,100 line and tone drawings and photographs depict hundreds of outfits ranging from lovely morning dresses and starkly attractive riding outfits to elegant carriage costumes, opulent evening dresses, and exquisite bridal gowns. Full-page plates also depict period millinery, footwear, underclothing, and other apparel, while three useful glossaries provide descriptions of materials, definitions of technical terms, and more.<br>Museum curators, vintage clothes collectors, and fashion historians will find this carefully researched and well-written book an indispensable tool for dating, identifying, and authenticating vintage clothing. Not only are styles described and illustrated in detail for each year; all the small details of construction by which specimens can be dated are given wherever possible. Moreover, designers, illustrators, and fashion enthusiasts will be delighted by the superbly detailed illustrations, which painstakingly document the fashionable finery of the Victorian era.<br></p><p></p><h2>Our Idea of God</h2><p>Our Idea of God [Paperback] [Jan 01, 1997] Morris, Thomas V. and Morris, Thom...</p><p></p><h2>Death of a Pumpkin Carver (Hayley Powell Mystery)</h2><p><i>For Hayley Powell, food and cocktails columnist for the </i>Island Times<i>, Halloween is all about costume parties and holiday treats&#x2014;until a killer crashes the party...</i><br><br>This Halloween, Hayley can&#x2019;t imagine a worse trick than her ex-husband Danny returning to Bar Harbor.

Tate&#x2019;s remarkable work&#x2014;filled with dark wit, dry humor, and deceptive simplicity&#x2014;is considered among the most accessible poetry written in the last several decades, and it has inspired acclaimed poet W.S.

His surrealist style strikes its own utterly new and original note in American poetry, transforming our everyday world into sublime burlesque&#x2014;a world where women give birth to wolves, wild babies are found in gardens, and Saint Nick visits on a hot July day. Tate's signature style draws on a marvelous variety of voices and characters, all of which sound vaguely familiar but are each fantastically unique, brilliant, and deeply particular.</p><p><em>The Eternal Ones of the Dream</em> features Tate's work from the last two decades, selected from seven books of poetry. The poems span from 1990's <em>Distance from Loved Ones</em> to 2009's <em>The Ghost Soldiers</em>, showcasing the impressive breadth of talent. As W. S. Merwin said of Tate, "Mr. Tate's gift is such that many of [his] poems move me at least to plain envy of what he can do."</p><p>James Tate was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1943. He is the author of seventeen books of poetry, including <em>Worshipful Company of Fletchers</em>, which won the National Book Award in 1994; <em>Selected Poems</em>, which won the Pulitzer Prize and the William Carlos Williams Award in 1991; and <em>The Lost Pilot</em>, which was selected by Dudley Fitts for the Yale Series of Younger Poets. He has also published a novel and a collection of short stories, as well as edited <em>The 1997 Best American Poetry Anthology</em>. His honors include a National Institute of Arts and Letters Award for Poetry, the Tanning Prize, the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.

In public talks worldwide, he strove to free listeners from conventional beliefs and psychological mind-sets in order to understand what is. This 3-volume series records his meetings with individual seekers from all walks of life, during which he comments on the struggles common to those who work to break the boundaries of personality and self-limitation. This second volume of the 3-part series includes discussions of creative happiness, devotion, worship, the fear of death, karma and an experience of bliss.</p><p>Many people with problems come to Krishmamurti hoping for answers. Their questions, and his replies, replies that transcend the intellect, are inside this book-242 pages of intuitionsJ. Krishnamurti (1895-1986) was a renowned spiritual teacher whose lectures and writings have inspired thousands. His works include On Mind and Thought, On Nature and the Environment, On Relationship, On Living and Dying, On Love and Lonliness, On Fear, and On Freedom.<br><br>Jiddu Krishnamurti lived from 1895 to 1986, and is regarded as one of the greatest philosophical and spiritual figures of the twentieth century. He was first discovered by the Theosophists on a beach in South India in 1910 at the age of 13 and was educated to be the new World Teacher for the ages. Then he took an extraordinary turn. In 1929, at one of the enormous annual European gatherings of the Theosophists in Holland, he announced his decision to step down from any formal role to promote him as a World Teacher, resigned as figure head of the Theosophists, and cut all ties to any notion of a religious or spiritual organization.Krishnamurti claimed no allegiance to any caste, nationality or religion and was bound by no tradition. His purpose was to set humankind unconditionally free from the destructive limitations of a conditioned mind. For nearly sixty years, he traveled the world and spoke spontaneously to large audiences until the end of his life in 1986 at the age of 90. He had no permanent home, but when not traveling, he often stayed in Ojai, California, Brockwood Park, England, and in Chennai, India. In his talks, he pointed out to people the need to transform themselves through self knowledge, by being aware of the subtleties of their thoughts and feelings in daily life, and how this movement can be observed through the mirror of relationship.</p><h2>Script Lettering for Artists (Lettering, Calligraphy, Typography)</h2><p>One feature of the general resurgence of the graphic arts is the revival of the script letter. Media such as advertising, packaging, book and periodical page designs, etc. have brought the glories of the master penmen of the past back into vogue. This volume, prepared by a noted authority and containing numerous examples of his handiwork, is a basic guide to the construction of the script letter and its practical use.<br>The book gives the beginner a thorough, straightforward course of instruction, with advice on virtually every facet of the art of script lettering. In his clear and economical presentation, the author tells you how to hold the pen, how the letters should be slanted, how to "build" the letters out of a few primary strokes, the direction of the pen in inking, and every other step of the process. He also deals with the construction of numerals, the flourish and its basic elements, how to correct mistakes, commercial handwriting, etc and gives a concise introduction to layout and package design. Throughout his account, Thompson stresses materials, tools, and equipment needed and provides exact specifications, brand names, penpoint types and sizes, and the like.<br>The history of lettering is also briefly sketched, and there are examples from early copybooks, including the work of some of the famous penmen and engravers of history: Bickham, Tompkins, Cocker, Barbedor, and others. In addition, the book offers dozens of illustrations of script work in present-day advertising and packaging, together with samples of various styles (round hand, bï¿½tarde, coulï¿½e, free style, and more). All this illustrative material furnishes excellent models for study and practice.<br>This, then, is an essential book for every art director and designer concerned with lettering. It is also a fundamental text used in advertising and commercial art courses throughout the country; no student in the field should be without a copy.</p><p></p><h2>On Looking: Essays</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Purpura is the real deal, and so is every successive sentence in this collection. A cornucopiac vocabulary is married to a strict economy of expression; an offbeat curiosity is married to the courage of difficult witnessing. . . .&#x201d;&#x2014;Albert Goldbarth</p><p>&#x201c;Purpura's prose is a system of delicate shocks&#x2014;leaps and connections and syncopated revelations, all in the service of the spirit negotiating the truth of its experience.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sven Birkerts</p><p>Lia Purpura's daring new book of lyric essays, <i>On Looking</i>, is concerned with the aesthetics and ethics of seeing. In these elegantly wrought meditations, patterns and meanings emerge from confusion, the commonplace grows strange and complex, beauty reveals its flaws, and even the most repulsive object turns gorgeous. Purpura's hand is clearly guided by poetry and behaves unpredictably, weaving together, in one lit instance, sugar eggs, binoculars, and Emerson's words: "I like the silent church before the sermon begins."<br><br>In "Autopsy Report," Purpura takes an intimate look at the ruin of our bodies after death, examining the "dripping fruits" of organs and the spine in its "wet, red earth." A similar reverence is held for the alien jellyfish in "On Form," where she notes that "in order to see their particular beauty...we have to suspend our fear, we have to love contradiction." Her essays question art and its responses as well as its responsibilities, challenge familiar and familial relationships, and alter the borders between the violent and the luminous, the harrowing and the sensual.&nbsp;<br><br>Above all, Purpura's essays are a call to notice. She is writer-as-telescope, kaleidoscope, microscope, and mirror.&nbsp; As she says: "By seeing I called to things, and in turn, things called me, applied me to their sight and we became each as treasure, startling to one another, and rare." This is, indeed, a rare and startling treasure of a book.<br><br><b>Lia Purpura </b>is the author of <i>Increase </i>(essays), <i>Stone Sky Lifting</i> (poems), <i>The Brighter the Veil</i> (poems), and <i>Poems of Grzegorz Musial: Berliner Tagebuch</i> and <i>Taste of Ash</i> (translations). Her awards include a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in Prose, a Pushcart Prize, a Fulbright Fellowship, the Associated Writing Programs Award in Creative Nonfiction, and the Ohio State University Press/The Journal Award in Poetry. Her poems and essays have appeared in Agni, DoubleTake, The Georgia Review, The Iowa Review, Parnassus: Poetry in Review, Ploughshares, and elsewhere. She is Writer-in-Residence at Loyola College in Baltimore, Maryland, and teaches at the Rainier Writing Workshop MFA Program in Tacoma, Washington.</p></p><p>Purpura&#39;s Increase won the 2000 AWP Creative Nonfiction Award. Stone Sky Lifting: Poems, won the 2000 Ohio State/The Journal Award. Also the author of The Brighter the Veil (the Towson University Prize in Literature), and Poems of Grzegorz Musial, translated on a Fulbright in Poland, Purpura teaches at Loyola in Baltimore and at the Rainier Writing Workshop in Tacoma.Looking, Purpura writes, is a way of paying attention; it is an almost spiritual practice, and it was "the sole practice I had available to me as a child." In these 18 pieces, the essayist (<i>Increase</i>) looks at colors (brown and red seem to be favorites), at shape and time, at dead bodies, weather, fear. The most trenchant essay muses about women being seen. These pieces are not so much essays as prose poems, lyrical hymns to beauty and aesthetics. Purpura describes single objects beautifully: Chinese lanterns are "those orange, papery pods gone lacy in fall, with a dim, silver berry burning inside." Though her putative topic is the visual, Purpura also ponders language, explaining word games and playing with the precision of diction (which verb best describes the things you do to drapes, she wonders: do you draw them, shut them or pull them?). Indeed, Purpura's prose is sometimes a tad too opaque: "If I can call the pin <i>image, memento, moment suspended,</i> then the whole northeastern Ohio sky draws close...." This slim volume requires careful, slow parsing, but readers who persevere will be rewarded with Purpura's deep intelligence. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book also widens the lens to reveal how the Bauhaus drew women from many parts of Europe and beyond, and how, through these cosmopolitan female designers, artists, and architects, it sent the Bauhaus message out into the world and to a global audience.<br>&nbsp;<br>Essential reading on the Bauhaus or for anyone interested in the too-often missed centrality of women artists to modern art and design,&nbsp;Bauhaus Women: A Global Perspective&nbsp;reclaims the other half of Bauhaus history, yielding a new understanding of the radical experiments in art and life undertaken at the Bauhaus and the innovations that continue to resonate with viewers around the world today.&nbsp;</p><p>Elizabeth Otto&nbsp;is a professor of modern and contemporary art history at The State University of New York at Buffalo.

Aided by some of the ruthlessly warlike Dasati and the enigmatic youth Bek, Pug has infiltrated the Dasati homeland. Back in Midkemia, the Dasati invasion proceeds, capturing Pug&#x2019;s wife, Miranda, who fortunately has more resources than Pauline ever had to deal with her perils; she is one of the strongest female characters in current high fantasy. Pug finds a friend thought long-dead in time for a climactic battle that may decide the fate of Midkemia, or not. High-class entertainment. --Roland Green</p><h2>The Tower: A Facsimile Edition (Yeats Facsimile Edition)</h2><p>The first edition of W. B. Yeats's <i>The Tower</i> appeared in bookstores in London on Valentine's Day, 1928. His English publisher printed just 2,000 copies of this slender volume of twenty-one poems, priced at six shillings. The book was immediately embraced by book buyers and critics alike, and it quickly became a bestseller. <br> Subsequent versions of the volume made various changes throughout, but this Scribner facsimile edition reproduces exactly that seminal first edition as it reached its earliest audience in 1928, adding an introduction and notes by esteemed Yeats scholar Richard J. Finneran. <br> Written between 1912 and 1927, these poems ("Sailing to Byzantium," "Leda and the Swan," and "Among School Children" among them) are today considered some of the best and most famous in the entire Yeats canon. As Virginia Woolf declared in her unsigned review of this collection, "Mr. Yeats has never written more exactly and more passionately."</p><p>William Butler Yeats is generally considered to be Ireland&#x2019;s greatest poet, living or dead, and one of the most important literary figures of the twentieth century. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>A last-minute shopper entering a London bookstore on Valentine's Day in 1928 with six shillings to spend on a gift for his or her beloved could hardly have made a better investment -- either poetically or financially -- than one of the 2,000 copies of a volume Macmillan &amp; Co. had published that morning: <i>The Tower</i> by W. B. Yeats. Twenty-one poems in 104 pages; six pages of notes; olive green cloth with a design by T. Sturge Moore stamped in gold on front and spine, also reproduced on the dust jacket. No illustrations, no book club dividends: simply one of the seminal volumes of Modern Poetry, indeed of poetry in English as we know it. Doubtless not every lyric is a masterpiece, but how often have we been given between two covers such "monuments of magnificence" as "Sailing to Byzantium," "Leda and the Swan," and "Among School Children" -- not to mention "The Tower," "Meditations in Time of Civil War," "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," or "Two Songs from a Play"? "A thing never known again," indeed.<br><br>The gestation of <i>The Tower</i> was a long process. A draft of "The New Faces" was sent to Lady Gregory on 7 December 1912; a draft of "From 'Oedipus at Colonus'" was sent to Olivia Shakespear on 13 March 1927. Yeats began to publish the poems that would form <i>The Tower</i> in journals as early as March 1921 and in book form the following year: <i>Seven Poems and a Fragment</i>, an edition of only 500 copies by the Cuala Press, the private press run by his sisters. Two more Cuala Press volumes would follow -- <i>The Cat and the Moon and Certain Poems</i> (1924), again in a printing of only 500 copies; and <i>October Blast</i> (1927), one of the rarest of all Cuala publications, only 350 copies. The single poem in <i>The Tower</i> not previously published would be "Colonus' Praise." Finally, on 16 September 1927, Yeats submitted copy for the volume to Macmillan:<br><br>I send you...the manuscript of 'The Tower.' Feeling that it was exaggerated in certain directions I continually put off sending it, but I cannot delay any longer. If, when you have received the Manuscript, you think the book too small, or have any fault to find, please delay it for a few months.<br><br>Yeats went on to explain that he was writing a series of poems for a limited American edition (<i>The Winding Stair</i>, 1929) and that these could be added to <i>The Tower</i> in a year. Seldom has a Nobel Laureate been quite so diffident about his latest work.<br><br>Although the Cuala Press <i>Michael Robartes and the Dancer</i> (1921) had been included in <i>Later Poems</i> (1922), Macmillan had not published a major new volume of Yeats's poetry since <i>The Wild Swans at Coole</i> (1919). It is thus not surprising that the publisher gave little heed to Yeats's reservations about <i>The Tower</i> and instead put the book into production, with publication on 14 February 1928. The volume quickly sold out, and a second impression was issued in March. In July 1929 Macmillan published a third impression with some corrections. An edition by Macmillan, New York, appeared on 22 May 1928, with a second impression in January 1929.<br><br>As usual, Yeats treated <i>The Tower</i> as a unique work, not simply a collection of poems. The order of the poems was anything but chronological, either in terms of composition or of the events depicted. For instance, the second poem written and the first published, "All Souls' Night," was placed last. "Meditations in Time of Civil War," describing the violence in Ireland of 1922-23, precedes "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen." A poem that concludes with the story of Christ, "Two Songs from a Play," is followed by one that describes the union of Leda and Zeus.<br><br>Yeats's interest in <i>The Tower</i> as a separate work of art extended to the physical book itself. Once the arrangements for the volume had been made with Macmillan, he enlisted his friend T. Sturge Moore, a writer and artist, to undertake the design, writing him on 23 May 1927:<br><br>I want you to design the cover -- design in gold -- and a frontispiece. The book is to be called <i>The Tower</i>, as a number of the poems were written at and about Ballylee Castle. The frontispiece I want is a drawing of the castle, something of the nature of a woodcut. If you consent I will send you a bundle of photographs. It is a most impressive building and what I want is an imaginative impression. Do what you like with cloud and bird, day and night, but leave the great walls as they are.<br><br>Moore immediately agreed. Yeats sent him some poems and photographs and made the further suggestion that "the Tower should not be too unlike the real object, or rather that it should suggest the real object. I like to think of that building as a permanent symbol of my work plainly visible to the passer-by. As you know, all my art theories depend upon just this -- rooting of mythology in the earth" (<i>LTSM</i> 114). Yeats approved of Moore's design of the Tower reflected in the adjacent stream, telling him, "It is interesting that you should have completed Tower symbolism by surrounding it with water" (<i>LTSM</i> 111). Unfortunately, because of some lost or misdirected correspondence, Moore failed to produce a frontispiece. But when Yeats received a copy of the volume, he wrote Moore from Rapallo on 23 February 1928, "Your cover for <i>The Tower</i> is a most rich, grave and beautiful design, admirably like the place..." (<i>LTSM</i> 123).<br><br>Yeats's earliest recorded comment on the book as a whole was made in a letter to Lady Gregory on 24 March 1928: "<i>The Tower</i> astonishes me by its bitterness." On 25 April 1928 he told Olivia Shakespear, "Re-reading <i>The Tower</i> I was astonished at its bitterness, and long to live out of Ireland that I may find some new vintage. Yet that bitterness gave the book its power and it is the best book I have written."<br><br>Although there was the odd dissenting voice, by and large the reviewers were in accord with Yeats's judgment on his achievement. Writing to Yeats less than two weeks after publication, Lennox Robinson commented that "'The Tower' seems to be getting wonderful notices, the <i>Observer</i> has it as a 'best seller'....and the <i>Independent</i> this morning is extraordinarily intelligent." Yeats himself told Lady Gregory on 1 April 1928 that "<i>Tower</i> is receiving great favour. Perhaps the reviewers know that I am so ill that I can be commended without future inconvenience....Even the Catholic Press is enthusiastic" (<i>L</i> 740). Likewise, he wrote Olivia Shakespear on 25 April 1928, "<i>The Tower</i> is a great success, two thousand copies in the first month, much the largest sale I have ever had..." (L 742). In an unsigned review in <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> for 1 March 1928, for example, Austin Clarke found in <i>The Tower</i> "a freedom of the poetic elements, an imaginative and prosodic beauty that brings one the pure and impersonal joy of art"; he also praised "the delightful cover design of this book." Writing in <i>The Criterion</i> for September 1928, John Gould Fletcher offered <i>The Tower</i> as evidence that Yeats "corresponds, or will correspond, when the true literary history of our epoch is written, to what we moderns mean by a great poet." In <i>The New Republic</i> for 10 October 1928 Theodore Spencer noted that "on the whole, the poems in this book are among the finest Mr. Yeats has written" and that "many...will remain a permanent part of English poetry." In sum, the consensus of both the reviewers and most later critics and readers of Yeats's poetry is well represented by Virginia Woolf's judgment in an unsigned review in <i>The Nation &amp; Athenaeum</i> for 21 April 1928: "Mr. Yeats has never written more exactly and more passionately."<br><br>Most other poets would have been more than content with such acclaim, and the story of <i>The Tower</i> would have ended. But Yeats as usual was not content, and over the next five years he would make significant changes to the volume, so much so that readers who know <i>The Tower</i> only from its final version will find this facsimile edition more than a little surprising.<br><br>For the 1929 third impression Yeats made only minor changes, some as small -- but telling -- as the addition of a hyphen in "moon-luminous" ("Meditations in Time of Civil War," III.10), some more significant, such as that to lines 5-6 of "Sailing to Byzantium." The text in 1928 is virtually unpronounceable:<br><br>Fish flesh or fowl, commend all summer long<br><br>Whatever is begotten born and dies.<br><br>One is tempted to think that both Yeats and the proofreader at Macmillan had nodded off, but in fact the exact same version had appeared a year earlier in <i>October Blast</i>, and on the proofs of that volume Yeats made a correction elsewhere in the first stanza of the poem but left these lines untouched. A second version appeared when the poem was used as the epigraph in <i>Stories of Red Hanrahan and The Secret Rose</i> (1927):<br><br>Fish, flesh or fowl, commend all summer long<br><br>Whatever is begotten born and dies.<br><br>This is arguably worse, and one is again tempted to assume somnolence. However, on 10 September 1927 Yeats had written Macmillan, "I return the proof of the poem, which is now correct. Through vacillation over the punctuation of the first stanza I have made a blotted proof but I think it is clear." So it was not until the 1929 version of <i>The Tower</i> that we are offered what surely seems the inevitable version (even if grammarians would protest the comma after "fowl"):<br><br>Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long<br><br>Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.<br><br>Yeats's next opportunity to revise <i>The Tower</i> occurred in connection with the volume of <i>Poems</i> in the Edition de Luxe, a project that in the event would never see the light of day. Either when he submitted copy on 1 June 1931 or when he corrected two sets of proofs from June through September 1932, Yeats made only one change of note, but it is an important one: "From 'Oedipus at Colonus'" was removed from its placement after "The Three Monuments" and was now included as section XI of "A Man Young and Old." As the new conclusion to the sequence, the choral ode, with its celebration of "the silent kiss that ends short life or long" and its invocation of "a gay goodnight," ameliorates, or at least puts into a changed perspective, the "bitterness" of the original ending, in which the speaker lamented that "Being all alone I'd nurse a stone / And sing it lullaby."<br><br>With the Edition de Luxe in limbo, Yeats suggested to his publishers that they should bring out a regular edition of a <i>Collected Poems</i>, and they agreed. This provided another opportunity to revise <i>The Tower</i>, and Yeats did not fail to seize it. The most visible change of all was the removal of "The Gift of Harun Al-Rashid" to the "Narrative and Dramatic" section at the end of the book, where it became the final poem in the volume. In a letter of 30 March 1933, Macmillan had suggested such a two-part division for the new collection and had listed five candidates for the second section. Yeats quickly indicated that he was "delighted" with the proposal. "The Gift of Harun-Al-Rashid" had not been on Macmillan's list, but it was nevertheless absent from <i>The Tower</i> when the <i>Collected Poems</i> was published in London on 28 November 1933, in an edition of 2,040 copies. Whether this was based on a later suggestion by Macmillan or was Yeats's own idea is unknown. (My guess is the latter.) In any case, Yeats in effect replaced "The Gift of Harun Al-Rashid" with the inclusion of an entirely new poem, "Fragments": part I had been published in an essay in the <i>Dublin Magazine</i> for October-December 1931; part II was taken from a draft of the Introduction to <i>The Resurrection</i>. From a biographical perspective, "The Gift of Harun Al-Rashid" is a veiled tribute to the automatic writing and other activities by Mrs. W. B. Yeats that produced the materials for <i>A Vision</i> (1925). Its placement at the end of the <i>Collected Poems</i> was thus altogether appropriate. "Fragments" is a fanciful epitome of the longer poem, with Mrs. Yeats quite literally the "medium" who provided Yeats with the "truth" that <i>A Vision</i> would present:<br><br><b>I</b><br><br>Locke sank into a swoon;<br><br>The Garden died;<br><br>God took the spinning-jenny<br><br>Out of his side.<br><br><b>II</b><br><br>Where got I that truth?<br><br>Out of a medium's mouth,<br><br>Out of nothing it came,<br><br>Out of the forest loam,<br><br>Out of dark night where lay<br><br>The crowns of Nineveh. (<i>P</i> 217-18)<br><br>Yeats situated "Fragments" in a rather important position, between "Two Songs from a Play" and "Leda and the Swan," displacing "Wisdom" to follow "Colonus' Praise." He made two other major changes to <i>The Tower</i>: he added to "Two Songs from a Play" a fourth stanza, first published in <i>Stories of Michael Robartes and His Friends</i> (1932); and he deleted the first seventeen lines of "The Hero, the Girl, and the Fool," printing the final ten lines as "The Fool by the Roadside," the form used in <i>A Vision</i> (1925).<br><br>Yeats had one more opportunity to revise <i>The Tower</i>, in June 1937 when he submitted copy for another never-to-be-published project, the Scribner Edition; but for once he restrained himself. Thus from 1933 onward, <i>The Tower</i> was understood to be the form included in the <i>Collected Poems</i>. It is a fundamentally different volume from that first published. This present edition allows readers access to the original version, with unadorned texts and only the handful of Notes provided by Yeats. Perhaps it will also enable us to imagine how someone opening the pages of <i>The Tower</i> for the first time on Valentine's Day in 1928 would have received the masterful poems therein.<br><br>Copyright ï¿½ 2004 by Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.</p><h2>The Trouble with Women</h2><p>Perfect for fans of Kate Beaton, Lena Dunham, and Caitlin Moran, <i>The Trouble with Women</i> is a feminist's brilliant, tongue-in-cheek, <i>hysterical</i> look at women's "issues," "frailties," and "failures" in our not-so-distant history.<br><br>Ever noticed that women don't feature much in history books, and wondered why?

The book explores what people are already doing to build ethical economies, presenting these deeds as mutual concerns: What is necessary for survival, and what do we do with the surplus produced beyond what will fulfill basic needs? What do we consume, and how do we preserve and replenish the commons&#x2014;those resources that can be shared to maintain all?

They listen to and dissect recordings of some of their favorite performances, and Murakami questions Ozawa about his career conducting orchestras around the world. Culminating in Murakami&#x2019;s ten-day visit to the banks of Lake Geneva to observe Ozawa&#x2019;s retreat for young musicians, the book is interspersed with ruminations on record collecting, jazz clubs, orchestra halls, film scores, and much more. A deep reflection on the essential nature of both music and writing, <i>Absolutely on Music </i>is an unprecedented glimpse into the minds of two maestros.</p><p><b>HARUKI MURAKAMI</b> was born in Kyoto in 1949 and now lives near Tokyo.

Coetzee, Milan Kundera, and V. S. Naipaul.<br><br>Translated from the Japanese by Jay Rubin.Introduction <br> My Afternoons with Seiji Ozawa<br> &nbsp;<br> Until we started the interviews in this book, I had never had a serious conversation with Seiji Ozawa about music. True, I lived in Boston from 1993 to 1995, while he was still music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and I would often go to concerts he conducted, but I was just another anonymous fan in the audience. Not long after that, my wife and I happened to become friends with his daughter, Seira, and we would see and talk to her father now and then. But our acquaintance was casual and had nothing to do with either his work or mine. <br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps one reason we never talked seriously about music until recently is that the maestro&#x2019;s work kept him so fully involved. As a result, whenever we got together to have a drink, we&#x2019;d talk about anything other than music. At most, we might have shared a few fragmentary remarks on some musical topics that never led anywhere. Ozawa is the type of person who focuses all his energy on his work, so that when he steps away from it, he needs to take a breather. Knowing this, I avoided bringing up musical topics when I was in his company.<br> &nbsp;<br> In December of 2009, however, Ozawa was found to have esophageal cancer, and after major surgery the following month, he had to restrict his musical activities, largely replacing them with a challenging program of recuperation and rehabilitation. Perhaps because of this regime, we gradually began to talk more about music whenever we met. As weakened as he was, he took on a new vitality whenever the topic turned to music. Even when talking with a musical layman such as myself, any sort of conversation about music seemed to provide the refreshment he needed. And the very fact that I was <i>not</i> in his field probably set him at ease.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have been a fervent jazz fan for close to half a century, but I have also been listening to classical music with no less enjoyment, collecting classical records since I was in high school, and going to concerts as often as time would permit. Especially when I was living in Europe&#x2014; from 1986 to 1989&#x2014;I was immersed in classical music. Listening to jazz and the classics has always been both an effective stimulus and a source of peace to my heart and mind. If someone told me that I could listen to only one or the other but not to both, my life would be immeasurably diminished. As Duke Ellington once said, &#x201c;There are simply two kinds of music, good music and the other kind.&#x201d; In that sense, jazz and classical music are fundamentally the same. The pure joy one experiences listening to &#x201c;good&#x201d; music transcends questions of genre. <br> &nbsp;<br> During one of Seiji Ozawa&#x2019;s visits to my home, we were listening to music and talking about one thing or another when he told me a tremendously interesting story about Glenn Gould and Leonard Bernstein&#x2019;s 1962 performance in New York of Brahms&#x2019;s First Piano Concerto. &#x201c;What a shame it would be to let such a fascinating story just evaporate,&#x201d; I thought. &#x201c;Somebody ought to record it and put it on paper.&#x201d; And, brazen as it may seem, the only &#x201c;somebody&#x201d; that happened to cross my mind at the moment was <i>me</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> When I suggested this to Seiji Ozawa, he liked the idea immediately. &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got plenty of time to spare these days. Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d; To have Seiji Ozawa ill with cancer was a heart-wrenching development for the music world, for me personally, and of course for him; but that it gave rise to this time for the two of us to sit and have good, long talks about music may be one of those rare silver linings that are not in fact to be found in every cloud.<br> &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br> As much as I have loved music over the years, I never received a formal musical education, have virtually no technical knowledge of the field, and am a complete layman where most things musical are concerned. During our conversations, some of my comments may have been amateurish or even insulting, but Ozawa is not the sort of person to let such things bother him. He gave each remark serious thought and responded to each question, for which I was tremendously grateful. <br> &nbsp;<br> I handled the tape recorder, transcribed our conversations myself, and presented the manuscript to him for corrections. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come to think of it, I&#x2019;ve never really talked about music like this before, in such a focused, organized way.&#x201d; This was the very first thing Ozawa said to me after reading the finished manuscript. &#x201c;But wow, my language is so rough! Do you think readers are going to understand what I&#x2019;m saying?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s true, the maestro does speak his own special brand of Ozawa-ese, which is not always easy to convert to standard written Japanese. He gesticulates grandly, and many of his thoughts emerge in the form of songs. Still, whatever &#x201c;roughness&#x201d; there may be in the way he expresses himself, the feeling he seeks to convey comes through with startling immediacy, overarching the &#x201c;wall of words.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite being an amateur (or perhaps because of it), whenever I listen to music, I do so without preconceptions, simply opening my ears to the more wonderful passages and physically taking them in. When those wonderful passages are there, I feel joy, and when some parts are not so wonderful, I listen with a touch of regret. Beyond that, I might pause to think about what makes a certain passage wonderful or not so wonderful, but other musical elements are not that important to me. Basically, I believe that music exists to make people happy. In order to do so, those who make music use a wide range of techniques and methods which, in all their complexity, fascinate me in the simplest possible way.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tried my best to preserve this attitude when listening to what Maestro Ozawa had to say. In other words, I tried my best to remain an honest and curious amateur listener on the assumption that most of the people reading this book would be amateur music fans like me.<br> &nbsp;<br> *******<br> &nbsp;<br> At the risk of sounding somewhat presumptuous, I confess that in the course of our many conversations, I began to suspect that Seiji Ozawa and I might have several things in common. Questions of talent or productivity or fame aside, what I mean here is that I can feel a sense of identity in the way we live our lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> First of all, both of us seem to take the same simple joy in our work. Whatever differences there might be between making music and writing fiction, both of us are happiest when absorbed in our work. And the very fact that we are able to become so totally engrossed in it gives us the deepest satisfaction. What we end up producing as a result of that work may well be important, but aside from that, our ability to work with utter concentration and to devote ourselves to it so completely that we forget the passage of time is its own irreplaceable reward.<br> &nbsp;<br> Secondly, we both maintain the same &#x201c;hungry heart&#x201d; we possessed in our youth, that persistent feeling that &#x201c;this is not good enough,&#x201d; that we must dig deeper, forge farther ahead. This is the major motif of our work and our lives. Observing Ozawa in action, I could feel the depth and intensity of the desire he brought to his work. He was convinced of his own rightness and proud of what he was doing, but not in the least satisfied with it. I could see he knew he should be able to make the music even better, even deeper, and he was determined to make it happen even as he struggled with the constraints of time and his own physical strength.<br> &nbsp;<br> The third of our shared traits is stubbornness. We&#x2019;re patient, tough, and, finally, just plain stubborn. Once we&#x2019;ve decided to do something in a certain way, it doesn&#x2019;t matter what anybody else says, that&#x2019;s how we&#x2019;re going to do it. And even if, as a result, we find ourselves in dire straits, possibly even hated, we will take responsibility for our actions without making excuses. Ozawa is an utterly unpretentious person who is constantly cracking jokes, but he is also extremely sensitive to his surroundings, and his priorities are clear. Once he has made his mind up, he doesn&#x2019;t waver. Or at least that is how he appears to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have met many different people in the course of my life, some of whom I have come to know pretty well, but where these three traits are concerned, I had never encountered anyone before Seiji Ozawa with whom I found it so easy and natural to identify. In that sense, he is a precious person to me. It sets my mind at ease to know that there is someone like him in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course, we are also different in many ways. For example, I lack his easy sociability. I do have my own sort of curiosity about other people, but in my case it rarely comes to the surface. As a conductor of orchestras, Ozawa is quite naturally in touch with a large number of people on a daily basis and has to act as the guiding member of a team. But no matter how talented he might be, people would not follow him if he were constantly moody and difficult. Interpersonal relations take on a great significance. A conductor needs like-minded musical colleagues, and he is often called upon to perform social and even entrepreneurial tasks. He has to give much thought to his audiences. And as a musician, he has to devote a good deal of energy to the guidance of the next generation.<br> &nbsp;<br> By contrast, as a novelist I am free to spend my life hardly seeing or talking to anyone for days at a time, and never appearing in the media. I rarely have to do anything that involves teamwork, and while it&#x2019;s best to have some colleagues, I don&#x2019;t especially need any. I just have to stay in the house and write&#x2014;alone. The thought of guiding the next generation has never crossed my mind, I&#x2019;m sorry to say (not that anyone has ever asked me to do such a thing). I&#x2019;m sure there are significant differences in mentality that come from such differences in our professional functions, not to mention innate personality differences. But I suspect that on the most basic level, deep down in the bedrock, our similarities outnumber our differences.<br> &nbsp;<br> Creative people have to be fundamentally egoistic. This may sound pompous, but it happens to be the truth. People who live their lives watching what goes on around them, trying not to make waves, and looking for the easy compromise are not going to be able to do creative work, whatever their field. To build something where there was nothing requires deep individual concentration, and in most cases that kind of concentration occurs in a place unrelated to cooperation with others, a place we might even call <i>dï¿½monisch</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, letting one&#x2019;s ego run wild on the assumption that one is an &#x201c;artist&#x201d; will disrupt any kind of social life, which in turn interrupts the &#x201c;individual concentration&#x201d; so indispensable for creativity. Baring the ego in the late nineteenth century was one thing, but now, in the twenty-first century, it is a far more difficult matter. Creative professionals constantly have to find those realistic points of compromise between themselves and their environment<br> &nbsp;<br> What I am trying to say here is that while Ozawa and I of course have found very different ways to establish those points of compromise, we are likely headed in pretty much the same direction. And while we may set very different priorities, the way we set them may be quite similar. Which is why I was able to listen to his stories with something more than mere sympathy.</p><h2>PandoraHearts, Vol. 2 - manga (PandoraHearts, 2)</h2><p>&#39;The answer you seek lies within them.&#39;Oz Vessalius may have survived his stint in the Abyss, but he is no closer to discovering the truth behind the &#39;sin&#39; for which he was condemned.

So said one of the most accomplished practicioners writing in English today, Seamus Heaney. For him, the power of the poem is achieved by running more voltage through the poetic device, by "over-languaging the language." What distinguishes this very specialized work from all the rest of written expression is that palpable sense of more. Or sometimes less. . . . <p>Despite a number of interesting experimental movements, the dominant mode in American poetry over the past quarter-century is a kind of secular plainsong that steers clear of rich musicality, complicated structures and that notion of superfluity. Perhaps the contemporary sensibility has been affected by how frequently we've seen bad ideas trotted out in elaborate intellectual clothing. From poetry to politics to pop culture, we've learned to be wary of the thorn tucked away inside the dramatic flourish, the manipulative impulse concealed by stylistic embellishment. In reaction, the governing poetic principles seem to be clarity and simplicity.</p><p>In the hands of a skilled writer, especially one who has committed years to observing and thinking about some small corner of existence -- poets such as Jack Gilbert, Mary Oliver and Louise Glï¿½ck -- this poetry can achieve breathtaking effects that are all the more mystifying because, at first, we can find no apparent cause for this sudden in-rush of energy.</p><p>Very quietly, Jane Hirshfield has been producing work that is earning her a place in the pantheon of those modern masters of simplicity. The publication of her sixth volume of poetry, After, will only serve to broaden her audience and solidify that reputation. </p><p>Hirshfield is a practicing Buddhist who has made her home in northern California -- as did the venerable Gary Snyder before her. But her religious discipline is rarely an overt presence in her texts. Her poems are more in the spirit of the T'ang Dynasty masters such as Wang Wei, whose spiritual outlook was wholly ingrained in the simplest practices of daily life, a reflected light emanating from the landscape. By paring down the moment to its essential elements and allowing ephemeral thoughts to be anchored within the tangible things of the world, Hirshfield comes up with poems that brilliantly portray even mundane experiences as if they were nothing short of revelation.</p><p>Take the following short poem, which appears near the end of the new collection:</p><p>Red Scarf</p><p>The red scarf <br>still hangs over the chairback.<br>In its folds, <br>like a perfume <br>that cannot be quite remembered, <br>inconceivable before.</p><p>That the scarf "still" hangs over the chair makes us privy to a passage of time, a certain intimacy, the utter daily-ness of even the dearest relationships. Who laid it there, after a long day, intending to tidy up later when time allowed? And who voices the poem's two simple observations, all while leaving the depths of emotion unrevealed? Why can't she bring herself to put away the errant scarf, to restore the household to its proper order? That "inconceivable before" gradually solidifies in our consciousness until it becomes an irrevocable border; beyond it remain those old days of normality that, as is often the case, only convey how loved they were through their absence. </p><p>The elegiac spirit of the poem is quietly reinforced in even the smallest elements; and though the aural quality of the poem is subdued, listen to the interplay between the soft burr of the abundant r's set against the hard-edged limitation of the c's. Even before the mind comprehends, the ear responds to that muted tug-of-war between longing and the acceptance of loss.</p><p>The poet's approach is clearly at work in "After Long Silence," the collection's opening poem, bringing to bear, in equal measures, precise vision and rigorous thought; the result is a marvelous sense of spaciousness. As she stands alone in her kitchen at night, Hirshfield's words create a clearing where even the ordinary moment is capable of yielding a sense of life's momentousness (which the Buddhist terms "mindfulness" but the poet is too self-possessed to lecture us about). The poem concludes with two lines that set the benchmark for the work to come:</p><p> The untranslatable thought must be the most precise.<br> Yet words are not the end of thought, they are where it begins.</p><p> Even when tackling subjects of obvious emotional intensity -- the deathbed of a friend ("The Bell Zygmunt"), the challenges of a spiritual life ("Theology" and "Between the Material World and the World of Feeling") -- Hirshfield strives for that same equanimity and unswerving attention, envying "the blue-green curve of a vase's shoulder, which holds whatever is placed within it -- the living flower or the dead -- with an equally tender balance."</p><p>Of course, Hirshfield's thoroughly human poems can only steer toward that perfection: "I, who am made of you only," she says to and about her concept of the moment, "speak these words against your unmasterable instruction -- // A knife cannot cut itself open,/ yet you ask me both to be you and to know you" ("Instant Glimpsable Only for an Instant"). This metaphysical balancing act is where the poet has situated her writing. When the poems are less than enthralling, we find the balance has shifted dangerously toward the "knowing" rather than the "being" side of the scale, as in some of the "Assays" series -- deep investigations of the ordinary (like "Gravel," "Tears," and even those humble prepositions "Of," "To," and "And"). Yet even the least successful of them is still thoughtful, inventive, beautiful -- qualities many a lesser poet would bargain for in a heartbeat. And in the case of her best work, the poems are so open-hearted and marvelously conceived that they are not just beautiful themselves but effortlessly contain beauty -- much like her imagined blue-green vase. What's more, they make us suddenly aware of what we too contain at every savored moment of the day. </p><p>Reviewed by Steven Ratiner <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

In addition to its importance to the history of ideas, this 1795 essay remains relevant to our own time.<br>Beginning with a political analysis of contemporary society &#x2014; in particular, the French Revolution and its failure to implement universal freedom &#x2014; Schiller observes that people cannot transcend their circumstances without education. He conceives of art as the vehicle of education, one that can liberate individuals from the constraints and excesses of either pure nature or pure mind. Through aesthetic experience, he asserts, people can reconcile the inner antagonism between sense and intellect, nature and reason.<br>Schiller&#x2019;s proposal of art as fundamental to the development of society and the individual is an enduringly influential concept, and this volume offers his philosophy&#x2019;s clearest, most vital expression.</p><p>Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller (1759-1805), usually known as Friedrich Schiller, was a German poet, philosopher, historian, and dramatist.Text: English, German</p><h2>You Come Too: Favorite Poems for Readers of All Ages</h2><p><p><b>A feast for lovers of American literature-the work of our greatest poet, redesigned and relaunched for a new generation of readers </b></p><p>No poet is more emblematically American than Robert Frost.

Inspired by Hannah Arendt, Reinhart Koselleck, and Paul Ricoeur, Hartog analyzes a broad range of texts, positioning <i>The Odyssey</i> as a work on the threshold of historical consciousness and contrasting it with an investigation of the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins's concept of "heroic history." He tracks changing perspectives on time in Chateaubriand's <i>Historical Essay</i> and <i>Travels in America</i> and sets them alongside other writings from the French Revolution. He revisits the insights of the French Annales School and situates Pierre Nora's <i>Realms of Memory</i> within a history of heritage and today's presentism, from which he addresses Jonas's notion of our responsibility for the future. <br><br>Our presentist present is by no means uniform or clear-cut, and it is experienced very differently depending on the position we occupy in society. We are caught up in global movement and accelerated flows, or else condemned to the life of casual workers, living from hand to mouth in a stagnant present, with no recognized past, and no real future either (since the temporality of plans and projects is inaccessible). The present is therefore experienced as emancipation or enclosure, and the perspective of the future is no longer reassuring, since it is perceived not as a promise, but as a threat. Hartog's resonant readings show us how the motor of history(-writing) has stalled and help us understand the contradictory qualities of our contemporary presentist relation to time.</p><p>Franï¿½ois Hartog explores crucial moments of change in society&#39;s &#34;regimes of historicity,&#34; or its ways of relating to the past, present, and future.

Inspired by the bizarre and uncanny, it is an attempt to use science and rationality to lift the veil off the irrational. Its ways are unconventional: weaving along its path one finds UFOs and fairies, quantum mechanics, analytic philosophy, history, mathematics, and depth psychology. The enterprise of constructing a coherent story out of these incommensurable disciplines is exploratory. But if the experiment works, at the end these disparate threads will come together to unveil a startling scenario about the nature of reality. The payoff is handsome: a reason for hope, a boost for the imagination, and the promise of a meaningful future. Yet this book may confront some of your dearest notions about truth and reason. Its conclusions cannot be dismissed lightly, because the evidence this book compiles and the philosophy it leverages are solid in the orthodox, academic sense.<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Bernardo Kastrup has a Ph.D. in philosophy and another in computer engineering.

What is an apprentice? It is a young person who is learning a skill from a master teacher. Our students will serve as apprentices to the great writers and great stories of history. </p><p> Students are often expected to write with no clear model before them. Modern composition scolds traditional writing instruction as rote and unimaginative. It takes imitation to task for a lack of freedom and personal expression. And yet, effective communication from writer to reader always requires some sort of form and structure. Many of historys greatest writers learned by imitation. In other words, writing takes the same kind of determined study as ballet or diving. Creativity uses conventional form as a stage or a springboard from which to launch grand jetï¿½s and somersaults. Too often students are expected to tackle complex writing assignments without learning the necessary intermediate steps. The assumption is that because most everyone can speak English well enough to be understood, and form letters with a pencil, that everyone should be able to write well. Yet how many of us would expect a child to sit at a piano, without piano lessons, and play a concerto? Writing is never automatic. </p><p> The Writing &amp; Rhetoric series method employs fluent reading, careful listening, models for imitation, and progressive steps. It assumes that students learn best by reading excellent, whole-story examples of literature and by growing their skills through imitation. Each exercise is intended to impart a skill (or tool) that can be employed in all kinds of writing and speaking. The exercises are arranged from simple to more complex. Whats more, the exercises are cumulative, meaning that later exercises incorporate the skills acquired in preceding exercises. This series is a step-by-step apprenticeship in the art of writing and rhetoric. </p><p> The word chreia (cray-a) comes from the Greek word chreiodes (cray-o-dees), which means ''useful.'' It is a short essay or remembrance that praises the author of a saying or proverb and shows why the saying is useful. This book employs all the skills of the preceding books in the series and teaches students how to write a six-paragraph essay on the basis of a saying or an action. The thinking and exercises occur within the framework of the stories which, in this book, include wonderful historical figures such as King Arthur, King Alfred, Lady Godiva, King Canute, Omar Khayyam, and more.</p><p> The six-paragraph essay using the five Ws (who, what, when, where, why) is arranged this way: </p><p> Praise the person or saying of your chreia or proverb<br> Restate the saying in your own words<br> Explain why this is useful<br> Contrast your example with another person in history<br> Compare your example with another similar example in history<br> Epilogue-conclude your essay</p><p>Classical Academic Press </p><p> Educators will find all curricula by Classical Academic Press to be created with four important attributes.

He lives in California.The Girl From Venice <br> <br>1<br> <br>Without a moon, small islands disappeared and Venice sank into the dark. Stars, however, were so brilliant that Cenzo felt drawn to them, even as mud oozed between his toes. The faint report of church bells carried over the lagoon, from farms drifted the smell of manure, and once or twice he caught the tremolo of a German gunboat plowing the water.<br> <br>A curfew barred all nighttime activity, no exceptions except for fishermen. Fishermen were nocturnal creatures who slept by day and fished by night. They stayed out on the lagoon for days at a time and when they came ashore they smelled so much of fish that cats followed them through the streets.<br> <br>Cenzo&#x2019;s only illumination was an oil lamp that hung on the mast, but he didn&#x2019;t need to see his catch; one touch told him whether he was handling sea bass, mullet, or a lost boot. He wore no shoes or boots himself; the mud would only suck them off. He did have a variety of nets and traps, tridents and rakes, for catching fish and damp sailcloth to cover them with. Every night was different. Tonight&#x2019;s catch was mainly cuttlefish come to lay their eggs. They rolled their otherworldly eyes toward the lamp. Fifty percent of fishermen said that cuttlefish were best caught on a full moon. Another fifty percent claimed the opposite. Sole, sea bass, and orata Cenzo laid in wicker baskets. Bullheads he threw back into the water.<br> <br>The air reverberated as Allied bombers passed overhead on their way to rain destruction on Turin or Milan or Verona. Anywhere but Venice. Sacred Venice was attacked only by pigeons. The population of the city had tripled as refugees poured in, hidden by the blackout.<br> <br>From the market Cenzo planned to sail home. For a week he had not bathed in freshwater or eaten more than grilled fish and polenta cakes. He pushed the boat off the grass to drop in the rudder when something sizable rose to the surface. Cenzo held his lamp over the water as the body of a girl took shape.<br> <br>A chill ran through Cenzo. He expected any second that the girl would become a hallucination. Fishermen saw all sorts of things at sea and eyes played tricks at night. At a touch she might separate into the white belly of a ray and the blank face of an octopus. But no, she stayed intact.<br> <br>She floated faceup in a dirty nightgown. He was no expert on the ages of girls but he guessed she was in her late teens. She was barefoot, her eyes were closed, and her skin was a nearly translucent white. Her lips were purple and long hair and sea grass wrapped around her neck. Cenzo was hardly a believer but he crossed himself automatically and lifted her into the Fatima&#x2014;no easy task, because the dead were so loose-limbed. Even as he laid her out on the bottom of the boat he knew that he should have left her alone. A woman on a boat was bad luck, and he supposed a dead girl was even worse.<br> <br>Trouble he didn&#x2019;t need. On one side were Fascists, on the other side partisans, and on the third side German soldiers who would shoot you as soon as look at you. Only a madman would raise his hand and say, &#x201c;Excuse me, signori, I found this dead girl floating by.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still, Cenzo wondered how a girl had gotten so far from land. Granted, most of the lagoon was shallow, but its channels were labyrinths, and between channels and the push and pull of different currents a person was trapped as much as a fish in a net. Someone must have brought her this far and then, for whatever reason, abandoned her, although Cenzo did not see any bruises or signs of violence.<br> <br>Cenzo untangled her hair. She had feathery black lashes and a small chin and with her closed eyes and youth she looked as serene as a Virgin in a painting. He couldn&#x2019;t throw her back as if she were trash. For decency&#x2019;s sake, he folded her hands over her breast and covered her with sailcloth he kept damp to cool the fish.<br> <br>What to do? According to the Bible, the dead had to bury the dead and it was the business of the living to keep on living. All the same . . . all the same, there was something about the death of anyone young that was a slap in the face. He didn&#x2019;t count himself a virtuous man. In his experience, no survivor could. But he could compromise. In this blackness no one had seen him. He could deposit the body on the Ponte della Paglia in Venice, where the dead were displayed for identification, and still sell his catch before the fish market closed.<br> <br>Enough! Decided! Cenzo stood facing forward, fit his oars into their locks, and rowed cross-handed, thrusting his entire body forward with each stroke. In a moment he found his rhythm and moved swiftly toward the margin between night and an abyss.<br> <br>He deliberately did not speculate on the origins of the girl. A cruel father, a jealous lover, a suicidal impulse, insanity? Perhaps she was sent by the devil to lure honest fishermen to their doom. At the first tug of wind he ran up his sail, a sheet with the emblem of three cupids barely visible in the dark.<br> <br>Fishermen believed in demons and wraiths. Everyone knew stories about men who took their place at the family table a day after they had drowned. Or of a miraculous vision of Saint Angelo that calmed a storm. Or of a captain who ignored a warning from the Madonna herself and was sucked by a whirlpool into the drink. Superstitions. Fables. Bedtime stories to scare children.<br> <br>He had barely passed from marsh to open water when the motor he had heard before returned, but much closer. A German gunboat was bearing down on him like a train and its spotlight crisply outlined him in white.</p><h2>Wonder Tales: The Book of Wonder and Tales of Wonder</h2><p>Irish writer Edward J. M. D. Plunkett (1878&#x2013;1957), the eighteenth Baron Dunsany, was one of English literature's most original talents. The author of many of the best fantastic tales in the language, he was also a great influence on other writers of the genre. American novelist H. P. Lovecraft wrote: "[Dunsany's] rich language, his cosmic point of view, his remote dream-worlds, and his exquisite sense of the fantastic, all appeal to me more than anything else in modern literature."<br>These 33 tales by one of the grand masters of fantasy contain all of the stories from two of Dunsany's finest&nbsp; collections &#x2014; <i>The Book of Wonder</i> and <i>Tales of Wonder</i> &#x2014; including the famous "The Three Sailors' Gambit," possibly the best chess story ever written; "The House of the Sphinx," "The Wonderful Window," "The Bad Old Woman in Black," "The Watch-Tower," "The Three Infernal Jokes," "The Secret of the Sea," and 26 other literary gems.</p><p>&#34;[Dunsany&#39;s] rich language, his cosmic point view, his remote dream-worlds, and his exquisite sense of the fantastic, all appeal to me more than anything else in modern literature.&#34;</p><h2>Daughters of the Church</h2><p><p>Rich in historical events and colorfully written, this fascinating account of women in the church spans nearly two thousand years of church history. It tells of events and aspirations, determination and disappointment, patience and achievement that mark the history of daughters of the church from the time of Jesus to the present. The authors have endeavored to present an objective story. The very fact that readers may find themselves surprised now and again by the prominent role of women in certain events and movements proves an inequality that historical narrative has often been guilty of. This is a book about women. It is a setting straight off the record -- a restoring of balance to history that has repeatedly played down the significance of the contributions of women to the theology, the witness, the movements, and the growth of the church. An exegetical study of relevant Scripture passages offers stimulating thought for discussion and for serious reevaluation of historical givens. This volume is enriched by pictures, appendixes, bibliography, and indexes. Like many of the women whose stories it tells, this book has a subdued strength that should not be underestimated.</p></p><p><p>Ruth A.

The history of this city--known as Byzantium, then Constantinople, now Istanbul--is at once glorious, outsized, and astounding. Founded by the Greeks, its location blessed it as a center for trade but also made it a target of every empire in history, from Alexander the Great and his Macedonian Empire to the Romans and later the Ottomans. At its most spectacular Emperor Constantine I re-founded the city as New Rome, the capital of the eastern Roman empire, and dramatically expanded the city, filling it with artistic treasures, and adorning the streets with opulent palaces. Around it all Constantine built new walls, truly impregnable, that preserved power, wealth, and withstood any aggressor--walls that still stand for tourists to visit.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From its ancient past to the present, we meet the city through its ordinary citizens--the Jews, Muslims, Italians, Greeks, and Russians who used the famous baths and walked the bazaars--and the rulers who built it up and then destroyed it, including Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the man who christened the city "Istanbul" in 1930. Thomas F. Madden's entertaining narrative brings to life the city we see today, including the rich splendor of the churches and monasteries that spread throughout the city.<br><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Istanbul </i>draws on a lifetime of study and the latest scholarship, transporting readers to a city of unparalleled importance and majesty that holds the key to understanding modern civilization.

Revered by such filmmaking giants as Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa, Tarkovsky is famous for his use of long takes, languid pacing, dreamlike metaphorical imagery, and meditations on spirituality and the human soul. His <i>Andrei Roublev</i>, <i>Solaris</i>, and <i>The Mirror</i> are considered landmarks of postwar Russian cinema.</p><p><i>Andrei Tarkovsky: Interviews</i> is the first English-language collection of interviews with and profiles of the filmmaker. It includes conversations originally published in French, Italian, Russian, and British periodicals. With pieces from 1962 through 1986, the collection spans the breadth of Tarkovsky's career. </p><p>In the volume, Tarkovsky candidly and articulately discusses the difficulties of making films under the censors of the Soviet Union. He explores his aesthetic ideology, filmmakers he admires, and his eventual self-exile from Russia. He talks about recurring images in his movies--water, horses, fire, snow--but adamantly refuses to divulge what they mean, as he feels that would impose his own meaning onto the audience. At times cagey and resistant to interviewers, Tarkovsky nevertheless reveals his vision and his rigorous devotion to his art.</p></p><p><p>A collection of interviews with the Russian filmmaker who directed <i>Andrei Roublev</i>, <i>Solaris</i>, and <i>The Mirror</i></p>These career-spanning interviews with the director of Andrei Roublev, Solaris, and The Mirror <p>--- Offer the first collection of interviews in the English language with the Russian director </p><p>--- Feature interviews ranging from 1962 to 1986, the year of Tarkovsky&#x2019;s death </p><p>--- Include interviews from French, Italian, and Russian periodicals that are made available in English for the first time </p><p>--- Expand the Conversations with Filmmakers Series</p></p><h2>Dance of Death: The Life of John Fahey, American Guitarist</h2><p>John Fahey hovers ghostlike in the sound of almost every acoustic guitarist who came after him, from Leo Kottke to Jimmy Page. In essence, John Fahey is to the solo acoustic guitar what Jimi Hendrix was to the electric: the man whom all subsequent musicians had to listen to.&nbsp;<br><br>Fahey made more than forty albums between 1959 and his death in 2001, most of them featuring only his solo steel-string guitar. He fused elements of folk, blues, and experimental composition, taking familiar American sounds and recontextualizing them as something entirely new. His artistic voice transformed the cultural landscape of his time&#x2014;and ours.&nbsp;<br><br>Yet despite his stature as a groundbreaking visionary, Fahey's intentions&#x2014;as a man and as an artist&#x2014;remain largely unexamined. His memoir, How Bluegrass Music Destroyed My Life, was largely fiction; his liner notes were full of half-truths. John Fahey's real story has never been told&#x2014;until now.&nbsp;<br><br>Journalist Steve Lowenthal has spent years researching Fahey's life and music, talking with his producers, his friends, his peers, his wives, his business partners, and many others. He describes how Fahey introduced prewar blues records and the men who made them to a broader public; how his independent label Takoma set new standards; how he battled his demons, including stage fright, alcohol, and prescription pills; how he ended up homeless and mentally unbalanced; and how, despite his troubles, he managed to found a new record label, Revenant, that won Grammys and remains critically revered.&nbsp;<br><br>This portrait of a troubled and troubling man in a constant state of creative flux is the compelling story of a great American outcast.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Steve Lowenthal</b>&nbsp;is a longtime music writer whose work has been published in&nbsp;<i>Spin</i>, the&nbsp;<i>Village Voice</i>, and many other publications, including his own magazine&nbsp;<i>Swingset</i>. He runs the VDSQ record label dedicated to current instrumental guitar music and manages the label Black Editions. He lives in Los Angeles.&nbsp;<b>David Fricke</b>&nbsp;is a senior editor at&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone</i>&nbsp;magazine.John Fahey is hardly a household name, yet it is surprising that this is the first biography of the idiosyncratic acoustic guitarist. Fahey, who died in 2011, was a singular if peculiar figure in the music world, a cult figure, really. Even as a high-school student, Lowenthal notes, Fahey felt like an outsider, &#x201c;more miserable and alienated&#x201d; than the average teenager, and he sought refuge in music. Fahey recorded more than 40 albums, mostly folk and blues in the so-called American Primitive style&#x2014;he was a virtuoso finger-picker&#x2014;while releasing some experimental material later in his career. But he struggled with many inner demons, including a bad case of stage fright and addiction to alcohol and prescription pills. Prone to self-destructive behavior, he even ended up homeless at one point. The fact that Fahey was able to maintain a long career and establish his own record labels, Takoma and Revenant, is in itself remarkable. While not always engaging, journalist Lowenthal does offer a sympathetic portrait of a troubled yet undeniably talented man. --June Sawyers</p><h2>The Husband Hunt (The Madison Sisters, 3)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t help but fall in love with Lynsay Sands!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Christina Dodd</p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Lynsay Sands takes romance fans on <em>The Husband Hunt</em>.

Today, the familiar news organizations of the legacy press are operating in a fragmenting and expanding mediaverse that resembles a big bang of proliferating online competitors that are challenging the very definition of news itself. Audience-powered sites such as the <i>Huffington Post</i> and <i>Vox</i> blend conventional political reporting with opinion blogs, celebrity gossip, and other ephemera aimed at getting clicks and shares.

It explains the mix of old and new, and points to possible outcomes. Where areas of change are clearly established, key concepts from earlier editions have been revised. There are new case studies, updates on old favorites, and insightful analyses of how the new media system and novel kinds of information and engagement are affecting our politics.

The Monied Metropolis is the first comprehensive history of New York&#39;s economic elite, the most powerful group in nineteenth-century America. Beckert explains how a small and diverse group of New Yorkers came to wield unprecedented economic, social, and political power from 1850 to the turn of the twentieth century. He reveals the central role of the Civil War in realigning New York&#39;s economic elite, and how the New York bourgeoisie reoriented its ideology during Reconstruction, abandoning the free labor views of the antebellum years for laissez-faire liberalism. Sven Beckert is the Dunwalke Associate at Harvard University. He is the recipient of several honors and fellowships, including the Aby Warburg Foundation prize for academic excellence, a MacArthur Dissertation Fellowship and a Andrew W. Mellon fellowship. This is his first book.</p><p>The Monied Metropolis is the first comprehensive history of the most powerful group in the nineteenth-century United States: New York City&#39;s economic elite. Using the insights of social history and a burgeoning historiography on the European bourgeoisie, the author examines the business activities of the city&#39;s merchants, industrialists, and bankers; describes their flamboyant social life; looks at their politics; and analyzes their view of the world. The Civil War, Reconstruction, labor, and democracy figure largely in the story. By the end of the Gilded Age, the book argues, upper-class New Yorkers had consolidated themselves into a self-conscious social class that put their stamp on the major issues of the day."Sven Beckert's Monied Metropolis is an extraordinary work of scholarship, certain to have a major impact on how we understand social change in the nineteenth century. Beckert deftly illuminates the complex interplay of economic, social, and political power that transformed scattered New York elites into a national ruling class. The Monied Metropolis is vigorously written, widely researched, and compellingly argued. I am confident it will open up a long-overdue debate about the uses of power in the nineteenth century United States." (T. Jackson Lears, Rutgers University) <p>"New York is a city known for the getting and spending of money, a story Sven Beckert relates in its full, fascinating physical and cultural impact." (Ada Louise Huxtable) </p><p>"The Monied Metropolis is an important analysis of class formation in New York City, impressively blending social, intellectual, and political history. Beckert, equally at home discussing intricate local conflicts and elaborating on the national consequences of these developments, has a great deal to offer to our understanding of politics in the nineteenth century."

Following Columbus&#x2019;s voyage, the Atlantic turned into a conduit for transferring these things among the four continents bordering the ocean in ways that affected people living on each of them.</p> <p>The appearance of The Atlantic World marks an important achievement, for it stands out as the first successful attempt to combine the many strains of Atlantic history into a comprehensive, thoughtful narrative. At the core of this ground-breaking and eloquently written survey lies a consideration of the relationships among people living in Europe, Africa, and the Americas, with a focus on how these relationships played important roles&#x2015;often the most important roles&#x2015;in how the histories of the people involved unfolded. The ways of life of millions of people changed, sometimes for the better but often for the worse, because of their relationship to the larger Atlantic world. And unlike existing texts dealing with one or another aspect of Atlantic history, The Atlantic World does not subjugate the history of Africa and South America to those of the &#x201c;British Atlantic&#x201d; or Europe.</p> <p>With historians and other scholars beginning to reconceptualize the Atlantic World as a dynamic zone of exchange in which people, commodities, and ideas circulated from the mid-fifteenth century until the dawn of the twentieth century, the interconnections between people along the Atlantic rim create a coherent region, one in which events in one corner inevitably altered the course of history in another. As this book testifies, Atlantic history, properly understood, is history without borders&#x2015;in which national narratives take backstage to the larger examination of interdependence and cultural transmission.</p> <p>Conceived of and produced by a team of distinguished authors with countless hours of teaching experience at the college level, this thoughtfully organized, beautifully written, and lavishly illustrated book will set the standard for all future surveys intended as a core text for the new and rapidly growing courses in Atlantic History.</p></p><p><p>THE Atlantic World</p><p><b>DOUGLAS R.

The book&#x2019;s exploration of this new language demonstrates a renaissance of functional ideas in modern programming. While functional programming isn&#x2019;t new in principle, it&#x2019;s seen a boost in popularity based on the current computer hardware available and the changing nature of projects programmers wish to tackle. Functional language constructs make it possible to efficiently automate currency, make use of multiple cores without much effort on the side of the programmer, are both more elegant and readable, and offer great potential in solving the issue of parallel hardware.

Having failed to write his intended novel (<i>The Great Fire of London</i>), instead Roubaud creates a book that is about that failure, but in the process opens up the world of the creative process.

Busy streets served as the setting for a bustling vegetable market, teeming with customers, awash in produce&#x2014;a rich bounty spread out over hundreds of stands. As far as one could see, makeshift shops in the open air stretched down the street&#x2014;in post&#x2013;World War II Romania. Communism, in the early 1950s, still had not gained total control of the Romanian market, and farmers came from the countryside to sell their goods. A young Romanian, Gabriel Bohm, walked through the marketplace with his mother in awe of the cornucopia of fruits and vegetables, displayed under homemade tents or on crates by ordinary farmers. Bohm remembered seeing a market &#x201c;full of merchandise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. good looking, healthy stuff.&#x201d; Yet within twenty years, Bohm witnessed a dramatic change. The same scene in 1965 would be much different: empty streets, devoid of vendors, patrolled by police. &#x201c;Those markets were deserted,&#x201d; he recalled years later: &#x201c;not a single carrot, not a single vendor selling a carrot.&#x201d;</p><p>There were other changes as well, ending many of the mainstays of life. Churches were closed, political gatherings banned. What had happened in the interim to Bohm and other Romanians? Communism took full control of the economy. &#x201c;We saw the country deteriorate,&#x201d; he noted. &#x201c;Anyone who could get out would. You had to be brain dead not to get out.&#x201d;1 Yet they could not get out. Nor could their neighbors in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, or East Germany, all of them trapped as prisoners of the Soviet Union, which since 1945 had embarked on a program of expansionism dictated by Soviet communism&#x2019;s godfather, Vladimir Lenin. Nor were the scenes of want and desperation in those Communist-controlled countries different in any of the other Eastern European nations that could be observed&#x2014;Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland&#x2014;and often they were worse.</p><p>East Germans lived in constant fear of the Stasi, the state&#x2019;s secret police, which recruited informants and compiled dossiers on almost every citizen to crush any potential opposition to the state. Even so much as an anti-Communist cartoon or joke was sufficient grounds for jail. One East Berliner who escaped to West Germany discovered decades later, after communism&#x2019;s collapse, that one of her best friends had informed on her to the Stasi. Everywhere in the Iron Curtain countries (as they were labeled by Winston Churchill in 1946), the state spied on average citizens. Even children were tricked into informing on parents. Bulgarians knew that people simply disappeared&#x2014;but they did not know that a secret prison island, kept off official maps, was their ultimate destination.</p><p>An atmosphere of discontent and fear permeated the Communist bloc. After a time, the fear and depression produced a numbing absence of vitality. Western visitors to Eastern Europe at this time all came back with the same impression of the visual images that awaited them there: &#x201c;gray,&#x201d; &#x201c;it was grime, gray,&#x201d; &#x201c;all gray,&#x201d; they said.2 Millions of people were prisoners in their own countries, unable to leave and usually afraid to resist.</p><p>A stunning contrast could be seen, literally, across borders where Western European nations thrived after 1945. Even Germany, crushed into rubble, with up to 10 percent of its 1939 population killed or wounded in the war, staged an astonishing revival after VE Day.3 The success could be attributed to the massive humanitarian and economic assistance provided by the United States, the adoption (even in quasi-socialist countries such as France, Italy, and Greece) of markets and price mechanisms, and the determination of Europeans themselves to recover from war yet again.</p><p>But Western Europe would soon drift into a lethargy of planned economies at the very time that a cold war was being waged to free Eastern Europe from those very ideas. By the time the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the West had lost or deliberately given up many of the freedoms that the East had sought and just gained. And within another decade still, the advent of the European Union would subtly and quietly impose controls on ordinary life that, while wrapped in a velvet glove, felt to some like the iron fist they had resisted.</p><p>Worse still, Europe was not alone. From 1945 to 1970, virtually all of the then-labeled Third World, including Africa, Asia, and Latin America, embraced state planning and rejected markets. Many of the European colonies (Uganda, Congo, Rwanda), winning their freedom in the postwar division of the world, immediately put dictators in power who squelched talk of republics and democracy. By the 1970s, postwar optimism had been replaced by widespread anger and desperation, with one set of masters exchanged for another.</p><p>None of this was supposed to have happened. Just as in the post&#x2013;World War I era, the end of war was to have meant a golden age of freedom and equality. Unlike after World War I, however, this time there was little doubt in non-Communist countries that the United States was in charge of the postwar world. Emerging from the war with its homeland and domestic industries not only entirely intact, but cranked up to full production, American productivity exceeded the wildest expectations of the Truman administration. Racing to shore up Europe from 1947 to 1950, the United States introduced the Marshall Plan, aiding war-torn Europe without asking for anything in return. Understanding the Soviet threat to the rest of Europe, America created a new alliance system and took virtually all of the major Western European nations under its protection.</p><p>As much as America was to be the leader and role model in this new era, all the efforts of U.S. occupation forces and all the money delivered by foreign aid could not address the fundamental weakness of postwar development efforts. The salient point of the post&#x2013;World War II period was that by 1957 no nation had adopted the four pillars that made American exceptionalism successful in the first place. As developed in the first volume of this history, those pillars consisted of a Christian (mostly Protestant) religious foundation, free enterprise, common law, and private property with titles and deeds. Missing even in postwar Europe, these features were almost totally unknown throughout the rest of the world. Long-established nations such as France and Italy seemed little different from emerging states such as Uganda or Cameroon, or the reconstructed countries of Germany or Japan.</p><p>Thus, another thirty years later&#x2014;by 2000&#x2014;the promise of global liberty that appeared so imminent in 1946 seemed to have slipped away to a significant degree almost everywhere. Drone spy technology monitored the movements of ordinary citizens; big-city mayors banned not only guns, but also soft drinks and fats and plastic bags; European cities saw &#x201c;no-go&#x201d; zones of Muslims abolish Western law and replace it with Sharia; countries published lists of children&#x2019;s names that were permitted and not permitted; street preaching was banned, and pastors jailed for speaking the Gospel aloud in churches. That these liberty-limiting developments occurred in African or Asian nations hardly raised an eyebrow&#x2014;so far had many of those countries fallen after 1945&#x2014;but that they all occurred in the United States or Europe seemed a shocking and stunning reversal of the very reasons the &#x201c;Good War&#x201d; had been fought in the first place.</p><p>Why had this subtle but dangerous reversal occurred so rapidly and so unexpectedly (to some)? Indeed, what were &#x201c;democracies&#x201d; doing engaging in such practices at all? In fact, all along the promise of postwar liberty itself was illusory, constructed on the premise that most of the world would be rebuilt along the lines of American-style democracy and freedoms. Our argument is that without the four pillars of American exceptionalism, such developments were not only likely, they were inevitable. Moreover, we argue that Europeans&#x2019; use of terms such as &#x201c;democracy,&#x201d; &#x201c;republic,&#x201d; and even &#x201c;liberty&#x201d; were not the same as those understood by Americans, and therefore other nations never entertained any intention of adopting the American pillars. In our previous volume of <i>A Patriot&#x2019;s History of the Modern World: From America&#x2019;s Exceptional Ascent to the Atomic Bomb</i>, we reviewed the impact of common law, a Christian (mostly Protestant) religious culture, access to private property (including ownership with easy acquisition of deeds and titles), and free-market capitalism, which brought America to the forefront of world power by the end of the war. Instead of copying American success, victorious or liberated nations more often sought only to dip their toes in the water of freedom, adopting free markets without common law or restricting capitalism, permitting Christian religion but steadily edging away from acknowledging the Christian foundations of society, paying lip service to private property without instituting the land-ownership institutions, such as titles and deeds, that are necessary to make it a reality. More often still, nations ignored all four of the pillars. Thus, the American model was only implemented piecemeal, where implemented at all (South Korea, for example). As we pointed out in volume 1, while any one of the pillars might be beneficial to a society, without all four no true American-style republic could be developed. The pillars were simply mutually dependent.</p><p>This volume continues the story of America&#x2019;s rise to world dominance through three themes. First, we trace the battle that began early in the twentieth century between the Progressives and the Constitutionalists. The former, grounded in the &#x201c;reform&#x201d; movement of the late 1800s, sought to perfect man and society by a process of government-directed and controlled change. The Progressives wanted to deemphasize the Constitution as it was written, and with it, American exceptionalism. They conducted a century-long assault on the notion that the United States had any providential founding, that its heroes and heroines were particularly wise, just, or courageous. By insisting that laws needed to be continually reassessed in light of current morality, Progressives saw the Constitution as outdated or irrelevant. Constitutionalists, on the other hand, maintained that America&#x2019;s founding stemmed from her Christian roots, and that the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were representative of common law doctrines in which codes of conduct, given by God to the people, bubbled up, supported and promoted by the people (as opposed to being handed to a king or ruler to be dispensed downward). Moreover, Constitutionalists maintained that the Founding Fathers were, in fact, wise and visionary, and that they established a framework of laws that addressed every eventuality. Progressives enacted a legislative campaign to regulate markets, redistribute wealth, and limit private property ownership. Constitutionalists wanted to free markets, enable all to pursue wealth, and restrain government&#x2019;s ability to infringe upon individuals&#x2019; property rights. Finally, the Progressives&#x2014;many of whom, in the early stages of the movement, were nominal Christians&#x2014;fervently labored to remove Christianity from the public square, from all political discourse, and from entertainment. Indeed, Christianity stood in the way of implementing most of their reforms. Constitutionalists, of course, understood the admonitions of the Founders, who urged that the nation adhere to its Christian roots and above all pursue virtue.</p><p>Over the course of the second half of the twentieth century and the first decade of the next, American exceptionalism faced hostility abroad, but more surprisingly, antipathy by numerous groups at home. The Progressive Left endeavored through the educational system, the law, and entertainment to denigrate and ridicule the very concept that America had anything special to offer, and to insist that the United States had become just one nation among many. That a number of Western and non-Western powers arose to challenge American dominance was to be expected, particularly when the American public had so generously provided the financial and commercial means of their recovery in many cases. Germany and Japan took the best of the American industrial, manufacturing, and management practices, modified them, and implemented them with zeal, producing world-class automobiles, electronics, robotics, and a host of other products that drove American goods either fully or partially from the market. Once several nations could claim economic proximity to the United States (though none could claim parity), were not their systems, goals, practices, and cultures worthy of emulation as well? But the Progressive assault did not stop there: it insisted that undeveloped cultures were no worse than ours, only different. Americans were urged to seek out the value in what in previous generations would have been termed &#x201c;backward&#x201d; cultures, and to &#x201c;understand&#x201d; practices once deemed undesirable at best or barbaric at worse. President Barack Obama&#x2019;s 2009 Cairo speech, as one example, cited advances and greatness in Islamic culture that never existed, implying that Americans needed to be more like Egypt rather than Egyptians being more like Americans.4 Absurdly saying that &#x201c;Islam has always been a part of America&#x2019;s story,&#x201d; Obama claimed that Islam &#x201c;pav[ed] the way for Europe&#x2019;s Renaissance&#x201d; and gave us &#x201c;cherished music,&#x201d; the &#x201c;magnetic compass and tools of navigation,&#x201d; and furthered &#x201c;our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed.&#x201d;5 Although his intention may have been to strike new chords of friendship, the act of ascribing to people accomplishments they never achieved looked phony and, according to polls in the subsequent three years, had no effect on Muslim views of America.</p><p>By 2012, the culmination of this Progressive march saw the United States elect a president with little or no understanding of free market capitalism, no appreciation of private property rights, little demonstrable Christian religious influence (to the point that by 2012 polls showed that up to half of the American public thought he was a Muslim), and an apparent disdain for American exceptionalism. Barack Obama repeatedly apologized to foreign nations for past American &#x201c;mistakes&#x201d; or transgressions and denigrated (or greatly mischaracterized) American exceptionalism by insisting that &#x201c;the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.&#x201d; As the British magazine <i>The Economist</i> stated, Americans had put into power &#x201c;a left-wing president who has regulated to death a private sector he neither likes nor understands.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;6 In 2008, in his famous &#x201c;Joe the Plumber&#x201d; comment, Obama stated that it was government&#x2019;s duty to &#x201c;spread the wealth around,&#x201d; and in 2012, referring to private businesses that had become successful, he said, &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t build that [business].&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Somebody else made that happen.&#x201d; That &#x201c;somebody else&#x201d; was, of course, government&#x2014;not the private sector. Comments such as those showed Obama had no concept of what made markets work. Likewise, in his bailout of General Motors, he demonstrated that he had no regard for private property&#x2014;in that case, the property of the bondholders who were saddled with an enormous loss to protect union pensions.</p><p>Obama&#x2019;s...</p></p><h2>Pathways (Valdemar Anthologies)</h2><p><b>The eleventh anthology of short stories set in Mercedes Lackey's beloved Valdemar universe features stories by debut and established authors and a brand-new story from Lackey herself</b><br><br>The Heralds of Valdemar are the kingdom&#x2019;s ancient order of protectors.

The distant voices rumbled like thunder at the horizon&#x2019;s edge. Thunder told tales about lightning, and lightning could drop with little warning to those who didn&#x2019;t understand the language of the weather. Selte did understand it&#x2014;at least, as well as she could. She&#x2019;d studied the weather all her life.<br> &nbsp;<br> What left her floundering was conversation with people. She hadn&#x2019;t had to find a way to communicate with anyone other than a few Heralds since being Chosen, and what little she did with those Heralds barely qualified anyway. Being alone with her understanding Companion in the wilderness, where she didn&#x2019;t have to listen to spoken words or Mindspeech, kept her from feeling her losses too much.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cerilka&#x2019;s sides buzzed against Selte&#x2019;s legs. Selte dug her knees inward before the Companion finished soothing her. Too hard, she realized, but nothing to do about it now.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cerilka tossed her head, but she did not repeat her buzzing.<br> &nbsp;<br> But her Companion was right. The storm cloud existed only in Selte&#x2019;s head. Sunlight beat down upon the dry, cracked dirt road. Even under the mottled shade of browned and curled leaves, the heat of high summer barely lifted. The air tasted of dust rather than ozone on the scarred remains of Selte&#x2019;s tongue.<br> &nbsp;<br> The weather had whispered the same tale for three months now, until there could be no mistaking it: parched, choking, much of Valdemar a dried-out, crumbling husk in the continuing drought. Selte had included as much in the written report of her weather studies upon her return to Haven and had received in exchange a new, uncomfortable set of orders.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ride Circuit through towns and villages rather than the wilderness. Ensure the people of Valdemar have the knowledge and tools to protect themselves from fires while the drought continues. Take this Herald Trainee and somehow, without the use of voice or Mindspeech, teach her to read weather.<br> &nbsp;<br> Selte didn&#x2019;t have any power over the weather. She could do nothing to affect when the rains came or how hard they fell. But she tried to be a good listener, and the weather offered no judgments on Selte&#x2019;s lack of replies. It simply confided in her, and she interpreted its meanings as her limited abilities allowed. Sometimes she got it wrong, and that was on her.<br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t blame the weather for the things her village had done to her in anger.<br> &nbsp;<br> Selte felt her buttocks tighten against the too-stiff leather of Cerilka&#x2019;s fancy saddle, and Cerilka&#x2019;s tail swish reply came more tentatively than usual. Selte brushed her fingers through her Companion&#x2019;s mane in a soft apology.<br> &nbsp;<br> She wished she could have ditched the fancy saddle back at the Collegium for the broken-in one she didn&#x2019;t have to be afraid to use, but their assigned Circuit meant they had to adhere to the official Herald and Companion uniform. She couldn&#x2019;t even scramble out of her own fancy Whites.<br> &nbsp;<br> But a pleasantly worn saddle and comfortable clothes wouldn&#x2019;t override the invasive presence of Herald Trainee Marli and Companion Taren behind Selte and Cerilka.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe how I&#x2019;ve gotten used to the Collegium. It&#x2019;s so quiet out here.&#x201d; Marli&#x2019;s voice rippled with ingrained laughter.<br> &nbsp;<br> Selte tensed. Was the girl laughing at her? Sounds abounded out here, with birds singing and the wind rushing, and these ridiculous bells chiming on the saddles with every step the Companions took. The only quiet one was Selte, since Marli apparently couldn&#x2019;t go even part of a candlemark without saying something. Selte had yet to give any kind of response to the girl&#x2019;s prattle, hoping she&#x2019;d get the hint and keep quiet eventually.<br> &nbsp;<br> No such luck yet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It really reminds me of my hometown, you know? Like life is at a slower pace outside of the city.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Trying to parse the chatter made it hard to focus on the subtleties of the weather, so Selte did her best to ignore the conversation she couldn&#x2019;t participate in anyway.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not that I dislike the city. I thought I would, you know, when I first came here. If it weren&#x2019;t for Taren, I&#x2019;d have been completely terrified out of my skull leaving home. But Haven isn&#x2019;t really so different.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Taren whickered, and Marli laughed again.<br> &nbsp;<br> A thin breeze wound across the road, gossiping about tomorrow&#x2019;s wind and flapping Selte&#x2019;s sweat-soaked Whites. Then it blustered into the brush off the road and disappeared into the wild.<br> &nbsp;<br> Selte sighed after it, a silent curse on her new, constricting Circuit.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know, right? The other Trainees say I&#x2019;m still a country bumpkin, but I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Selte twisted around, her pants squeaking against the fancy saddle, and glared at the Trainee. With one hand she covered her own mouth, and with the other she pointed at Marli.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marli stared, eyes wide and mouth open, but no more sound came out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Satisfied her point had finally been received, Selte righted herself. She let Cerilka take over following the road, tipped her head back, and watched the thin, teasing shreds of cloud drift overhead. They were too high and too thin to shed even a single raindrop onto parched Valdemar, but at least they were something. They were the weather hemming and hawing over the idea of maybe changing course sooner than later. Unless they weren&#x2019;t. She could never be entirely sure of the weather until it happened.<br> &nbsp;<br> There wasn&#x2019;t much Selte could teach anyone, really. A brief pressure flared in her mind, Cerilka&#x2019;s sign for Selte to emerge from her solitary musings. The Companion knew better than anyone Selte&#x2019;s preference for silence, and she always kept their mental contact gentle and unobtrusive, reserving actual words for emergencies.<br> &nbsp;<br> Taren had moved up beside Cerilka, and Selte glanced over to see Marli smiling at her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So, do you think it&#x2019;ll rain?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Selte bit back a groan and focused on the long, tortuous road before them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marli had never run into a person she couldn&#x2019;t talk to. Before Taren had Chosen her, she&#x2019;d been the peacekeeper in her hometown, which was no small feat, considering how the farming families back home mistrusted the Heralds that tried to solve their long-standing grudges. At the Collegium, she&#x2019;d solved a multitude of disputes of varying degrees of seriousness. She&#x2019;d made tons of friends throughout her training, getting people excited about working together no matter the task. People just felt comfortable opening up to her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Herald Selte, however, had given her the cold shoulder at every turn, except when circumstances forced them to interact. Then she&#x2019;d either glare at Marli or shy away, until Marli felt guilty for even opening her mouth.<br> &nbsp;<br> The situation had her feeling cramped and constrained.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>:How am I supposed to learn anything if Herald Selte won&#x2019;t talk to me?: </i>she asked Taren.<br> &nbsp;<br> They were riding through the cobbled streets of a lakeside town, checking that the people had followed the fire safety instructions another Herald had left a few weeks earlier. From here Marli had a view down the hill to the lake itself and the enlarged strip of rocky beach the drought had exposed. Small boats lay stranded on the stones, and the breeze carried the odor of rotting fish from where the carcasses lay baking in the unrelenting sun.<br> &nbsp;<br> Taren snorted. <i>:The Collegium told you Herald Selte was mute. What sort of miracle do you expect her to pull off?:</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>:That&#x2019;s not what I meant,: </i>Marli replied. <i>:She clearly has a way to communicate with Cerilka. Why can&#x2019;t she try something like that with me? Or she could write. All Heralds</i><br> <i>learn that.: </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>:Perhaps she is not comfortable having someone listen to her.:</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Marli supposed that must be true. At each stop along their Circuit, whether the stop was a check-in like this one or a full teaching session for the fire-safety guidelines, Selte had stepped back and let Marli lead the discussions. While Marli enjoyed the process of working through people&#x2019;s issues with the new codes, she was still a Trainee. She could use a little help every now and then. But once they were back on the road, Selte&#x2019;s prickly silence reigned, and Marli&#x2019;s plans to confront her would-be mentor fizzled away. The woman looked ready to bolt every time Marli asked for guidance.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>:There must be </i>something <i>I can do to put her at ease,: </i>Marli said. She could find common ground with anyone.<i> </i>She wasn&#x2019;t an Empath or anything, her mental gifts being<i> </i>Farsight and Fetching, but she didn&#x2019;t need a supernatural<i> </i>enhancement to pick up on people&#x2019;s signals.<i> </i>Usually, anyway. The only signal she got from Herald<i> </i>Selte was &#x201c;leave me alone,&#x201d; and it came through like a<i> </i>clap of thunder.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marli wrapped up her inspection of the last row of houses, marking them on her list as &#x201c;compliant.&#x201d; As Taren turned them away from the lake view and back toward the center of town, Marli tilted her head back the way she&#x2019;d seen Selte do time after time. Not a single cloud drifted above today, but the harsh sunlight leached the sky of all color until it looked oppressively overcast. Marli hardly had time to feel the moisture of her own sweat before the thirsty air wicked it away. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mimicking Selte once more, Marli sniffed, grimacing at the fish odor. She wondered what Selte read of the coming weather from the weak breeze. Not that broaching the topic of the weather had a different effect than any other conversation Marli might start. Herald Selte seemed content to bristle and sulk her way through this Circuit.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marli and Taren arrived at the town&#x2019;s main gate in time to see Selte and Cerilka plodding up from the opposite side of town. Both Herald and Companion moved as though they had burrs under the saddle but were too burned by the sun to care. The creases in Selte&#x2019;s weathered face were etched deeper than they&#x2019;d been this morning, and her rumpled Whites masked her wiry frame, making her look older than she was.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marli erred on the side of caution, as well as conserving her own energy, and merely raised a hand in greeting. Selte rewarded her with a short version of the stink-eye.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shade?&#x201d; Marli said when Selte drew closer. The path out of town would soon take them to a stand of oak and birch, as well as the Waystation the four of them were utilizing while they worked with this town.<br> &nbsp;<br> Selte nodded curtly and proceeded to share all kinds of gestures with Cerilka as they all moved along the road.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>:She&#x2019;s certainly comfortable with Cerilka listening to her,: </i>Marli said. She didn&#x2019;t begrudge her own plaintive<i> </i>tone. It was hot, she&#x2019;d had a long day, and Herald Selte<i> </i>simply wasn&#x2019;t being fair. When they reached the Waystation,<i> </i>Marli would confront Herald Selte. No more letting<i> </i>guilt silence her.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>:You can&#x2019;t solve everyone&#x2019;s problems, my love,: </i>Taren said.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>:I&#x2019;m just not trying hard enough.:</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Taren chuckled, and Marli let the affectionate sound soothe her ruffled feathers. He always indulged her need to grope for a solution, even when she hadn&#x2019;t been asked. <i>Most </i>people were grateful anyway.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the station, Marli and Selte settled the Companions as comfortably as could be expected in the shade of a tall oak before heading inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> A layer of grime coated the floor and fixtures, mostly dust blown in by the hot wind. This Waystation didn&#x2019;t have the homey, welcoming feel of the one by Marli&#x2019;s hometown, but it was stocked with what they needed for a couple of nights, and it was serviceable as a shelter from the elements. Of course, rain would have been the more usual worry, but the Waystation provided a bit of relief from the unending sun, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> Selte moved to where her saddlebags lay on the floor and, without any shame, stripped out of her Whites.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marli averted her eyes. So much for a confrontation now. Even after all her time at the Collegium, she hadn&#x2019;t been able to let go of her small-town breeding. A person deserved privacy while naked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Instead, she grabbed her own saddlebags and went back outside to sit in the biggest patch of shade she could find. Dry grass crunched under her as she got comfortable. The heat still beat down too much to be pleasant, but she&#x2019;d endured worse on this trip. She removed a piece of dried meat and the map from her bag.<br> &nbsp;<br> She liked tracing her finger along the roads of the map, liked charting the course from one stop on their Circuit to the next. She liked imagining the conversations she could have with a more willing companion on the long stretches between settlements.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her finger paused at the upcoming turn the road would take once they moved on from the lake town. If they took the northern fork, they would reach her own hometown within a day and a half. Instead, their assigned Circuit directed them to the southern fork.<br> &nbsp;<br> Homesickness and relief warred within her. It was becoming harder to pretend she&#x2019;d simply been too busy to use her Farsight even once to check in on her family and friends back home. The possibility that they had denounced her for becoming a Herald always drifted through the back of her mind. She missed everyone so terribly, but they might want nothing to do with her now.<br> She&#x2019;d never had to grow accustomed to loneliness.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fighting the burn behind her eyes, Marli tore a bite from her dried meat. She had to chew a while before her throat loosened enough to swallow. Taren was with her, she reminded herself. He would never leave her. But her Companion simply didn&#x2019;t understand how her family&#x2019;s rejection would hurt her. He wasn&#x2019;t as reliant on other people&#x2019;s approval as she was.<br> &nbsp;<br> Something rustled in the dry grass behind her.

In this volume, The Library of America collects the finest of these stories: twenty-four in all, along with some revealing essays and an earlier version of his novel&nbsp;<i>The Thin Man</i>.<br><br>Mixing melodramatic panache and poker-faced comedy, a sensitivity to place and a perceptive grasp of social conflict, Hammett&#x2019;s stories are hard-edged entertainments for an era of headlong change and extravagant violence. For the heroic sagas of earlier eras Hammett substituted the up-tempo, devious, sometimes nearly nihilistic exploits of con men and blackmailers, fake spiritualists and thieving politicians, slumming socialites and deadpan assassins.<br><br>As a guide through this underworld he created the Continental Op, the nameless, laconic detective, world-weary and unblinking, who serves as protagonist of most of these stories. The deliberately unheroic Op is separated only by his code of professionalism from the brutality and corruption that run rampant in stories such as &#x201c;Zigzags of Treachery,&#x201d; &#x201c;Dead Yellow Women,&#x201d; &#x201c;Fly Paper,&#x201d; and &#x201c;$106,000 Blood Money.&#x201d;<br><br>Hammett&#x2019;s years of experience as a Pinkerton detective give even his most outlandishly plotted mysteries a gritty credibility, and his intimate knowledge of San Francisco made him the perfect chronicler of that city&#x2019;s waterfronts, back alleys, police stations, and luxury hotels. By connecting crime fiction to the realities of American streets and American speech, his&nbsp;<i>Black Mask</i>&nbsp;stories opened up new vistas for generations of writers and readers.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.</p><p><b>Dashiell Hammett </b>(1894-1961), a master of the&nbsp;hard-bolied detective fiction, was the&nbsp;author of&nbsp;<i>The Maltese Falcon</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Thin Man</i>, and the Continental Op stories, among other celebrated works.The first great author in the hard-boiled detective genre, Hammett remains one of the most entertaining, as demonstrated by this largest single gathering ever of his short fiction. This collection's main distinction is that editor Steven Marcus uses the original story texts from their appearance in Black Mask magazine, recovering occasional pieces of lost wording, chapter breaks and other niceties. However, because Hammett is such a standard figure, most of these stories will be familiar to mystery fans from readily available collections. Marcus repeats everything except "Tulip" and "Corkscrew" from The Big Knockover (1966), edited by Lillian Hellman, and every story from The Continental Op (1974), which he edited. The recent Nightmare Town (2001) scooped the original Nick and Nora-less Thin Man fragment out from under him, plus "Zigzags of Treachery," "Two Sharp Knives" and others that would have made this book a highly desirable purchase. Only "Arson Plus," "Slippery Fingers" and "Creeping Siamese" are unique to this selection. Unless you make a line-by-line comparison, you won't notice great differences between these texts and those in the other books (still, the Black Mask wording is the most satisfying). One senses a missed opportunity for the major collection Hammett fandom has longed for: the complete Continental Op short stories, in order, original texts, under one set of covers that would be irresistible. Nonetheless, for the non-specialist, this volume stands as the best compendium yet of this classic crime author's shorter fiction. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Living Yogacara: An Introduction to Consciousness-Only Buddhism</h2><p>Yogacara is an influential school of Buddhist philosophy and psychology that stems from the early Indian Mahayana Buddhist tradition.

Throughout the book, Gorman demonstrates the centrality of participating in Christ for Paul&#39;s theology and spirituality.</p><p>"Michael Gorman is one of the leading Paul scholars of our time, committing his professional career to expounding the significance of union with Christ for both academic theology and for practical Christianity.

This novel presents the story of the Pintor sisters - from a family of noble landowners now in decline - their nephew Giacinto, and their servant Efix, who is trying to make up for a mysterious sin committed many years before. Around, below, and inside them the raging Mediterranean storms, the jagged mountains, the murmuring forests, and the gushing springs form a Greek chorus of witness to the tragic drama of this unforgiving land. Deledda tells her story with her characteristic love of the natural landscape and fascination with the folk culture of the island, with details about the famous religious festivals held in mountain encampments and the lore of the &#34;dark beings who populate the Sardinian night, the fairies who live in rocks and caves, and the sprites with seven red caps who bother sleep.&#34; Introduction by the Sardinian ethnographer, Dolores Turchi.</p><p>Grazia Deledda was born in 1871 in Nuoro, Sardinia. She had a limited formal education, but was an avid reader. She published her first story in 1886 when she was fifteen, in a newspaper in Nuoro. Her stories continued to be published in one of the many fashion magazines of the late nineteenth century, Ultima Moda. Although the dismay of her family and friends distressed her, it also strengthened her resolve to succeed. In 1899 she left Nuoro and went to Cagliari, where she met and married Palmiro Madesani. A year later they moved to Rome, where Deledda lived a quiet life writing and caring for her husband and two sons until her death in 1936, at sixty-five. Deledda wrote thirty-three novels and many books of short stories, almost all of them set in Sardinia. Among her better-known novels are Elias Portolu, Canne al vento (forthcoming from Italica Press in 1998 as Reeds in the Wind), La madre, Annalena Bilsini, and Cosima (Italica Press, 1988), her posthumous autobiographical novel. Grazia Deledda became, in 1926, the first Italian woman to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature.Efix, the Pintor sisters&#39; servant, had worked all day to shore up the primitive river embankment that he had slowly and laboriously built over the years. At nightfall he was contemplating his work from where he was sitting in front of his hut halfway up White Doves&#39; Hill. A blue-green fringe of reeds rustled behind him. Silently stretching out before him down to the river sparkling in the twilight was the little farm that Efix considers more his than the owners&#39;: thirty years of possession and work had certainly made it his, and the two hedgerows of prickly pear that enclose it like two gray walls meandering from terrace to terrace, from the hill to the river, are like the boundaries of the world to him. In his survey the servant ignored the land on either side of the farm because it had once been Pintor property. Why dredge up the past? Useless regret. Better to think about the future and hope in God&#39;s help. And God promised a good year, or at least He had covered all the almond and peach trees in the valley with blossoms; and this valley, between two rows of white hills covered with spring vegetation, water, scrub, flowers, together with the distant blue mountains to the west and the blue sea to the east, gave the impression of a cradle billowing with green veils and blue ribbons, with the river murmuring monotonously like a sleepy child. But the days were already too hot and Efix was also thinking about the torrential rains that swell the bankless river and make it leap like an all-destroying monster. One could hope, but had to be watchful, like the reeds along the riverbank beating their leaves together with every breath of wind as though warning of danger. That was why he had worked all day and now, waiting for night, he wove a reed mat so as not to waste time and prayed that God make his work worthwhile. What good is a little embankment if God&#39;s will doesn&#39;t make it as formidable as a mountain? Seven reeds across a willow twig, and seven prayers to the Lord and to Our Lady of Rimedio, bless her. In the intense twilight blue her little church and the quiet circle of cabins around it down below lay like a centuries-old abandoned prehistoric village. At this hour, as the moon bloomed like a big rose in the bushes on the hill and euphorbia spread its perfume along the river, Efix&#39;s mistresses were also praying. Donna Ester, the oldest, bless her, was certainly remembering him, the sinner. This was enough to make him feel happy, compensated for his efforts. Footsteps in the distance made him look up. They sounded familiar. It was the light, swift stride of a boy, the stride of an angel hurrying with some happy or sad announcement. God&#39;s will be done. It&#39;s He who sends good and bad news; but Efix&#39; heart began to pound, and his black cracked fingers trembled on the silvery reeds shining in the moonlight like threads of water. The footsteps were no longer heard. Nevertheless, Efix remained motionless, waiting. The moon rose before him, and evening voices told him the day had ended: a cuckoo&#39;s rhythmical cry, the early crickets&#39; chirping, a bird calling; the reeds sighing and the ever more distinct voice of the river; but most of all a breathing, a mysterious panting that seemed to come from the earth itself. Yes, man&#39;s working day was done, but the fantastic life of elves, fairies, wandering spirits was beginning. Ghosts of the ancient Barons came down from the Castle ruins above Galte on Efix&#39;s left and ran along the river hunting wild boar and fox. Their guns gleamed in the short alder trees along the riverbed, and the faint sound of barking dogs in the distance was a sign of their passing. Efix could hear the sound that the panas - women who died in childbirth - made while washing their clothes down by the river, beating them with a dead man&#39;s shin bone, and he believed he saw the ammattadore (the elf with seven caps where he hid his treasure) jumping about under the almond woods, followed by vampires with steel tails. It was the elf that caused the branches and rocks to glitter under the moon. And along with the evil spirits were spirits of unbaptized babies - white spirits that flew through the air changing themselves into little silvery clouds behind the moon. And dwarfs and janas - the little fairies who stay in their small rock houses during the day weaving gold cloth on their golden looms - were dancing in the large phillyrea bushes, while giants looked out from the rocks on the moon-struck mountains, holding the bridles of enormous horses that only they can mount, squinting to see if down there within the expanse of evil euphorbia a dragon was lurking. Or if the legendary canana, living from the time of Christ, was slithering around on the sandy marshland. During moonlit nights especially this entire mysterious population animates the hills and valleys. Man has no right to disturb it with his presence, just as the spirits have respected him during the sun&#39;s course; therefore it&#39;s time to retire and close one&#39;s eyes under the protection of guardian angels. Efix made the sign of the cross and stood up, but he was still waiting for someone. Nevertheless he shoved the plank that served as a door across the entry way and leaned a big reed cross against it to keep spirits and temptation from entering his hut....</p><h2>Poetics and Rhetoric (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics)</h2><p>&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RPoetics and Rhetoric&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R, by &amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RAristotle&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R, is part of the &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RBarnes &amp; Noble Classics&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;R&nbsp;&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;Rseries, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

In the &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RPoetics&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R he focuses mainly on drama, especially tragedy, and introduces ideas that are still being debated more than two thousand years later. Among them is the often misunderstood theory of the unities of action, place, and time, as well as such concepts as: art as a form of imitation, and drama as an imitation of human actions; plot as a drama&#x2019;s central element, and &#x201c;reversal&#x201d; and &#x201c;recognition&#x201d; as important elements within a plot; and the purging of pity and fear from the audience as the function of tragedy. Rather than offer these ideas merely as abstract theories, Aristotle applies them in cogent analyses of the classic Greek dramas&#x2015;the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&nbsp;&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;RIn the &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RRhetoric&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R, Aristotle turns to the principles of persuasive writing, including argumentation and the logical development of proof, appeals to emotion, and matters of delivery and style.

Performing and watching a tragedy were political acts, part of the celebration of a festival in honor of the god Dionysus. But the political context and significance of tragedies are not obvious, and are certainly less apparent than that of rhetoric. Though they came into being as Athens became a democracy, modern democracies do not create a central role for tragedy, and Shakespeare's England and Racine and Corneille's France were not especially democratic places. The two&#x2014;tragedy and democracy&#x2014;are not necessary for one another. </p><p>Tragedy, according to Aristotle, has a double origin in nature: We take pleasure in imitating and in seeing or experiencing imitations. While "imitation" is its traditional translation, <i>mimesis</i> needn't mean copying as in the modern word "mimeograph." Since chapter 2 tells us that tragedy imitates people who are "better than in real life," tragic imitation cannot be simply copying. <i>Mimesis</i> can just as well be translated as representation, depiction, or portrayal. Keeping those options in mind can help make us more flexible in understanding Aristotle's meaning. </p><p>The history of tragedy, according to Aristotle, also had an ending at the time of Sophocles (496-406): "Having passed through many changes, it found its natural form, and there it stopped" (4.1449a15). I will talk about that beginning and ending later, but in between Aristotle traces what he sees as the crucial intermediate stages after the natural beginning in imitating and recognizing imitations: </p><p>Poetry now diverged in two directions, according to the individual character of the writers. The graver spirits imitated noble actions, and the actions of good men. The more trivial sort imitated the actions of meaner persons. . . . Tragedy&#x2014;as also comedy&#x2014;was at first mere improvisation. The one originated with the authors of the dithyramb, the other with those of the phallic songs, which are still in use in many of our cities. . . . Aeschylus first introduced a second actor; he diminished the importance of the chorus, and assigned the leading part to the dialogue. Sophocles raised the number of actors to three, and added scene-painting (4.1448b25-1449a18). </p><p>Other sources supplement what the <i>Poetics</i> tells us. Tragedies were performed before audiences that could contain half the citizens of Athens, perhaps up to 30,000 people, seated in sections divided according to their membership in political groups and military units. Non-citizens were present too, wealthy foreigners and resident aliens, and maybe&#x2014;the question is debated&#x2014;women. They were there to be witnesses to the power and greatness of the city, while the citizens in the audience were in a sense participants: Young men about to begin their military service constituted the chorus, while the citizens in the audience were war veterans. Each year three poets were chosen and each presented three tragedies and a satyr-play&#x2014;plays that recounted the more grotesque parts of myths and heroic stories&#x2014;in competition for a prize, as part of a religious and civic celebration in honor of the god Dionysus. The poets were well-known citizens: Aeschylus fought at the battles of Marathon and Salamis, and Sophocles was a general. (The author as professional didn't yet exist, and the artist as society's victim or as rebel had yet to be invented.) The importance of these performances to the city is signaled by the fact that poor people received a public subsidy to allow them to attend, just as they were paid to attend juries and serve in the military. Paying for the actors, the choruses, costumes, etc. was a duty of the wealthy, in the same way that outfitting naval vessels was. (Instead of luxury taxes, the wealthy were expected to make heavy voluntary contributions, and there were penalties if they didn't.) </p><p>These facts about tragedy are important reminders that in the Greek world, there were no separate categories of the ethical, the political, the military, the religious, and the aesthetic. They also help us to see what a remarkable book the <i>Poetics</i> is. None of the facts in the last paragraph could be found in the <i>Poetics</i>. Plato had discussed drama and poetry in relation to the ethical and political effects that acting and watching had, as did Aristotle in the <i>Politics</i>. The <i>Poetics</i> by contrast seems to be a modern work: It considers only the aesthetic qualities of a work of art and says nothing at all about its ethical and political effects. While dividing our experiences into distinct categories of the political, the ethical, the religious, and the aesthetic is a recent development, Aristotle himself wrote the <i>Ethics</i>, the <i>Politics</i>, and the <i>Poetics</i> as separate works. We might naturally expect those distinct subjects to be covered in different books, but Aristotle separates them within a culture that didn't think of them as separate spheres of activity. Reading the <i>Poetics</i>, one would never think that there were gods involved in the stories of most tragedies or that tragedies took place as part of religious festivals. If it is easy for us to think of works of art in such isolation, we need to keep in mind how strange it was for a Greek of Aristotle's time.<br></p></p><h2>The Public and Its Problems: An Essay in Political Inquiry</h2><p><p>More than six decades after John Dewey&#x2019;s death, his political philosophy is undergoing a revival.

Stevens</b> is an editor, journalist, and author of eleven books.<br><br></p><p><b>Prologue</b></p><br><p><b>A Needle in A Haystack</b></p><p>On June 18, 1944, a young man lurched across the searing sand of Rockaway Beach, New York. As he picked his way through a maze of blankets, beach chairs, and umbrellas, throngs of beachgoers stared at him. He looked out of place in long pants hiked up to his ankles and a sweat-dampened, white button-down shirt embroidered with his name. Among the crowd in bathing suits and trunks, it was not his attire that caught people&#x2019;s attention. It was the cardboard sign he held aloft. He was looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack.</p><p>The young man had received a frantic telephone call an hour ear- lier at the beachfront candy store where he worked. An urgent voice had launched him out into the sweltering heat with a message he had hastily scrawled on the cardboard. He was hoping to find someone, a husband and wife whom he had never met, had never even seen.</p><p>Scores of men and women were watching the candy clerk as they enjoyed the hot summer day, some casting brief glances, others staring intently. They instinctively understood the sign&#x2019;s message. America&nbsp;had now been at war with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan for some two and a half years, and most people on the beach knew someone in uniform. Many had lost a loved one in action. As more and more beachgoers realized what the young man was doing, they stepped aside to let him pass. A handful of the more curious ones trailed him down the shoreline.</p><p>Frequently wiping his brow, squinting from the sunlight, he wan- dered up and down the beach for more than an hour, his face flushed from the heat and visibly sunburned. As the minutes dragged on, he could not help but think that he had been dispatched on a well- intentioned but futile errand. He wondered what the chances were that his message would find the two total strangers in the dense crowds. Still, he kept walking, with the sign over his head, through the forest of umbrellas.</p><p>He stopped to take a few long breaths, his arms aching from hold- ing up the sign. Several yards behind him, a middle-aged couple and a pretty, black-haired young woman stumbled through the thick white sand toward him. Tears streamed down their sun-darkened faces. They had spotted the words hastily scrawled on the cardboard sign.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>&#x201c;Just A Milk RuN&#x201d;</p><p><i>December 31, Early Morning of New Year&#x2019;s Eve, 1943</i><br><i>Seething Airfield, Norfolk, England<br>&nbsp;</i></p><p>An icy gust slapped against Staff Sergeant Arthur Meyerowitz as he stepped outside from the 448th Bomb Group&#x2019;s aluminum-walled mess hall just after 5 a.m. Wincing, he turned up the fleece collar of his leather bomber jacket and tugged his cap and earmuffs tightly. He peered for a few moments at the neat rows of cylindrical barracks arrayed on frost-cloaked farmland along the southern flank of Seeth- ing Airfield, home to his unit, the 715th Squadron, in Norfolk, England. He lingered on the mess hall&#x2019;s stoop as other airmen and pilots brushed past him.</p><p>A hell of a way to spend the last day of the year, he thought, but he had to do the premission checks for <i>Harmful Lil Armful</i>, a B-24&nbsp;Liberator in the 448th Bomb Group. He had been up since 2:30 a.m., when he had been rousted from sleep by an officer&#x2019;s flashlight and ordered to go out with <i>Harmful Lil Armful</i>, whose flight engineer and top-turret gunner, Sergeant George Glevanick, had just been&nbsp;rushed to the base hospital. Now, after the premission briefing and breakfast, Arthur steeled himself for his second mission.</p><p>His maiden mission had come on December 24 aboard a B-24 named <i>Consolidated Mess</i>. The target was a Nazi V-1 missile site at Labroye, a relatively short hop across the English Channel in the Pas-de-Calais, in northern France. With luck, Arthur might be back at Seething in time for the New Year&#x2019;s Eve parties that he had planned to attend on base and in Norwich, some ten miles away on the east coast.</p><p>Lucky bastard, he mused about Glevanick, shivering. At least Glevanick was guaranteed to make it into 1944. Then Arthur lowered his shoulder against the raw wind and stepped off the stoop onto a muddy path that wound toward three concrete airstrips.</p><p>A few yards from the mess hall, Arthur spotted a group of young Englishwomen, slowed down, and removed his cap and earmuffs as he passed them. Despite the early hour, they were waiting to pick up their 8th Air Force boyfriends who had two-day passes for New Year&#x2019;s Eve and Day. Usually, the girlfriends had to stand outside the main gate, but they had been allowed on the base for the holidays after a security check.</p><p>As they waited for their airmen to emerge from the building, the women were chatting amid a swirl of cigarette smoke. Running his hand through his dense, dark hair, Arthur shot them a grin. Several smiled back at the handsome twenty-five-year-old airman.</p><p>A pretty blonde spotted Arthur&#x2019;s shoulder patch, which was embla- zoned with the image of a grinning, muscular rabbit clad in a super- hero&#x2019;s costume and cape who was perched atop a light blue bomb.</p><p>&#x201c;The 715th, is it? Where are the Rabbits off to, then, in such a rush so close to New Year&#x2019;s?&#x201d; she called out.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a date with some Germans,&#x201d; he replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Good luck&#x2014;and give the bastards our regards,&#x201d; another woman chimed in as Arthur picked up his pace and waved.1</p><p>Attention from women was something Arthur was used to. The five-foot ten-inch, 160-pound staff sergeant possessed the street smarts and swagger of his Bronx neighborhood, and he exuded a con- fidence to which women were drawn. Before enlisting in the Army, Arthur had loved dressing stylishly, heading to the Garment District and stretching part of his paychecks into good deals on fashionable clothes. His family was accustomed to seeing beautiful young women on his well-tailored sleeves.</p><p>At Norfolk, Arthur enjoyed chatting with attractive Englishwomen, but it never went beyond a few pints and dances in town or on base. Tucked in the breast pocket of his flight suit, his wallet held a snapshot of Esther Loew, his dark-haired, dark-eyed girlfriend back in the Bronx. An aunt had introduced him to the pretty twenty-one-year-old Esther before he had shipped out to England, and he was quickly smitten, so much so that he had considered marriage. He had decided, however, that with the casualty rate of bomber crews in the European and Pacific theaters of operation reaching the highest of any service branch&#x2014;even more than the submarine fleet&#x2014;he could not justify making her another in the sadly burgeoning ranks of young war widows. Still, she intended to wait for him, and he could not talk her out of it.</p><p>Arthur carried another memento of home besides Esther&#x2019;s photo. Around his neck was a thin gold chain with a <i>chai</i>, the Hebrew sym- bol for &#x201c;life.&#x201d; His mother had given it to him before he had left for England.</p><p>As the rows of B-24s lining the airstrip materialized through the mist and freezing rain, Arthur had no time to think of Esther and of his parents and brother back in New York. <i>Harmful Lil Armful </i>had to be inspected, and his crewmates depended on Arthur, the flight engineer, to make sure that the plane was fit to fly. Everyone knew that the Allied invasion of Fortress Europe loomed. The waves of American and British bombers pounding German targets in France around the clock were &#x201c;preparing the ground&#x201d; for Operation Overlord,&nbsp;the largest amphibious assault in history. What no one except the top brass knew yet was where and when the Allies would strike across the British Channel.</p><p>A few hours earlier at the mission briefing, the 448th&#x2019;s charismatic commander, thirty-seven-year-old Colonel James M. Thompson, had unveiled a huge map of Europe and thrust a pointer at three red- circled spots. Silence enveloped the crowded room as the pilots and crews waited to hear Thompson, whose neatly parted salt-and-pepper hair and trim Clark Gable mustache made him the very picture of a tough pilot and leader, speak in his no-nonsense Texan drawl. From airfields across eastern and central England, 250 B-17s and B-24s, including <i>Harmful Lil Armful</i>, would be escorted by hundreds of P-47</p><p>Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang fighter planes as they unleashed a daylight strike against the Nazi airfield at La Rochelle/Laleu, south- west of the Brest Peninsula. If the clouds over the site proved too dense, the secondary target was another Nazi airstrip, at Chï¿½teau- bernard.</p><p>Thompson, a nerveless pilot who had racked up fifty-five missions over Europe and had earned a reputation for never sugarcoating danger for his men, told the assembled airmen that German flak and fighter attacks all the way into and out of the target run would be intense.</p><p>Arthur knew they would soon be &#x201c;in the soup&#x201d; over France. Arthur could never have envisioned that he would see France or&nbsp;England, let alone go to war. Still, the eldest son of David and Rose&nbsp;Meyerowitz had always thirsted for adventure.</p><p>Arthur was born on August 15, 1918, in the Bronx, in a tough neighborhood largely composed of Jewish, Irish, and Italian families crowded into old, yellow-brick, flat-roofed apartment buildings that clotted Findlay Avenue. At 1205 Findlay Avenue, built in 1915, the Meyerowitz family lived in a third-floor, one-bedroom apartment.&nbsp;David and Rose had a second child, Seymour, on August 11, 1927. When Seymour was old enough, he and Arthur shared a Murphy bed in the living room.</p><p>Forty-three-year-old David Meyerowitz had emigrated from Roma- nia to New York as a boy and had been compelled to leave school at eighth grade to help the family survive. He went on to work as a driver and salesman in the wholesale bakery business and to marry Rose Blumen- thal, a vivacious, dark-haired woman born and raised in the Bronx. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, times turned increasingly tight for the Meyerowitz family and their Findlay Avenue neighbors. David always managed to keep his family fed, housed, and clothed, but money was always short. He and Rose were constantly juggling the bills, unable to think about moving out of their apartment.</p><p>To survive on Findlay Avenue, Arthur learned how to use both his instincts and his fists. He had to because on the corners of Find- lay and adjoining streets, Russian and Eastern European Jews, Irish, and Italian kids claimed patches of local asphalt as their personal turf. In Arthur&#x2019;s building people watched out for each other, and when a job was lost or an illness struck families, neighbors helped out as best they could.</p><p>Raised to respect women and imbued with a strong sense of right and wrong, Arthur was never afraid to stand up to bullies. Once, when the din of a man beating his wife echoed down the third-floor hallway of the apartment complex, Arthur rushed toward the noise and started banging on the neighbors&#x2019; apartment door. The husband opened it, red-faced and sweating. In the small living room, his wife was sobbing, her clothes disheveled, bruises rising on her face.</p><p>Arthur, clenching his fists at his side, glared at the older man, who backed away a step as Arthur stood in the doorway, saying nothing, his eyes still fixed on the neighbor. Then Arthur leaned forward, jabbed a finger just under the man&#x2019;s chin, and nodded in the direction of the cringing woman. Arthur turned around and waited for the door to&nbsp;close. He lingered in the hall, listening as the man and the woman talked in low, almost hushed tones. There were no more slaps or shouts.</p><p>Over the following days and weeks, it became apparent that the husband had gotten the message: if he threatened his wife again, his tough young neighbor would give him a dose of the same. The beat- ings stopped.</p><p>Arthur graduated from Robert Morris High School, built in 1897 as the first public high school in the Bronx, and the education he received in the soaring Gothic brick structure complete with turrets and spires was rated as one of the finest offered by any of the city&#x2019;s public high schools. In the school&#x2019;s sprawling auditorium, Arthur and the rest of the student body gathered for daily assemblies amid the hall&#x2019;s ornate columns and a commemorative World War I mural that would earn the school a place on the National Historic Register. Arthur saw that masterpiece daily for four school years. The mural had been rendered by renowned French artist August Gorguet and entitled <i>After Conflict Comes Peace</i>. At the time, the vivid images of war-scarred France did not matter much to the teenager.</p><p>After his 1936 graduation from Morris, Arthur immediately began working; any thought of college was out of the question with the Depression still battering the nation and the family needing every dol- lar. He sold electrical fixtures for Jack Meyerowitz, his uncle, and dou- bled as a receiving and shipping clerk and supervisor of ten men for a wholesale lampshade company in Brooklyn for three and a half years. Although fortunate to have any work in the midst of the Depression, in 1939 Arthur was employed only for twenty-eight weeks, earning $400. Fortunately for the family, his father worked all fifty-two weeks and brought home $1,560, but there was never much left over after the bills were paid.</p><p>Wanting to contribute more and finding his life too sedate despite his busy social calendar, Arthur began to think about other avenues for a steadier and more exciting financial future. He had always been&nbsp;interested in airplanes and yearned for the chance to fly, and in late&nbsp;1940, he spoke to an Army recruiter in Manhattan about the Army Air Corps. The sergeant told Arthur that a college education was not mandatory for aviation cadets so long as they had graduated from a good high school. The recruiter added that once Arthur completed basic training, he &#x201c;could transfer to the Air Corps if he passed the physical and mental examinations.&#x201d;</p><p>Filled with excitement, Arthur, who had never traveled beyond New York and New Jersey, signed a one-year enlistment paper on January 8, 1941. He was formally inducted at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and was soon on his way to basic infantry training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.<br><br>Once he completed basic, Arthur made two requests to his com- manding officer: a pass to attend Seymour&#x2019;s Bar Mitzvah in New York and the application to transfer to the Army Air Corps. The officer turned down the Bar Mitzvah pass brusquely and then set Private Meyerowitz straight regarding aviation training&#x2014;Arthur had signed up for one year, and the Army did not allow such enlistees to waste its time and money in flight school. The recruiting sergeant had lied to him, and Arthur, furious but trapped, started counting the days until January 8, 1942, when his assignment would be complete. Meanwhile, he sent Seymour one month&#x2019;s Army wages as a Bar Mitzvah present. He earned stellar reviews from his superiors first as a rifleman and then as a .50-caliber machine gunner.</p><p>On December 7, 1941, about a month before his enlistment was up, Arthur was stunned by the news of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x2019;s strike against Pearl Harbor. He immediately signed up for three more years, out of patriotism, out of the certainty that he would be drafted anyway, and out of hope that he could now transfer to the Air Cor...</p></p><h2>The Physics Of Consciousness: The Quantum Mind And The Meaning Of Life</h2><p>For decades, neuroscientists, psychologists, and an army of brain researchers have been struggling, in vain, to explain the phenomenon of consciousness. Now there is a clear trail to the answer, and it leads through the dense jungle of quantum physics, Zen, and subjective experience, and arrives at an unexpected destination. In this tour-de-force of scientific investigation, Evan Harris Walker shows how the operation of bizarre yet actual properties of elementary particles support a new and exciting theory of reality, based on the principles of quantum physics-a theory that answers questions such as "What is the nature of consciousness, of will?" "What is the source of material reality?" and "What is God?&#x201d;</p><p>It's not every day you hear a physicist ask what happens when we die. Evan Harris Walker, sparked by the early, tragic loss of his love, does just that and more in <i>The Physics of Consciousness</i>, a book in the same vein as Fritjof Capra's <i>The Tao of Physics</i>, but with a firmer grounding in scientific understanding. Walker marries the traditions of Southern literature--a longing for the past, a resignation toward the present, and a determined optimism about the future--to a technical explanation of the limits of materialism; a weird synthesis, certainly, but charming and engaging nonetheless. Since his primary topic is consciousness, Walker turns to neuroscience and Buddhism (its spiritual equivalent) for inspiration. His quantum-mechanical approach to synaptic transmission and "the speed of consciousness" are difficult to evaluate and seem a bit overstretched, but his discussions of the history and current events of physics are lucid and ironically lend weight to his antimaterialistic arguments. Is this, as he hopes, another step toward 21st-century religion, or just another New Age reinterpretation of the spooky world of the ultrasmall? Don't bet on either--<i>The Physics of Consciousness</i> will jog your brain in new ways and, if nothing else, you'll find a new appreciation for how little we really know about ourselves. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>Evan Harris Walker</b>, founder of the Walker Cancer Institute, has made major scientific contributions in astronomy, astrophysics, physics, neurophysiology, psychology, and medicine.

The most important of the Mysteries existed for two millennia at the village of Eleusis. Its deities were Demeter and Persephone, interchangeable in their roles as mother and daughter. The initiations and other rituals of this goddess-based cult were a profound secret: divulging information was punishable by death. For centuries, scholars have probed the secrets of the Eleusinian Mysteries and <i>kykeon,</i> its sacramental Eucharist &#x2014; a sacred drink containing psychoactive chemicals similar to those in LSD. Their discoveries have been buried in the arcane language of alchemy, the occult sciences, and secret societies. Here, in prose accessible to all readers, Carl Ruck unravels the Mysteries, revealing the awesome powers of the goddesses, as well as the pagan underpinnings of Western culture.<br></p><p></p><h2>The Age Fix: A Leading Plastic Surgeon Reveals How to Really Look 10 Years Younger</h2><p><b>Don't buy another overpriced cream.</b><b>Hold off on that invasive procedure.</b><b>Stop avoiding the reflection in the mirror.</b><b>Get your Age Fix.</b><br>Here's what the experts know but aren't telling you-until now:- The drugstore brand can be just as effective-or better-than the expensive cream at your dermatologist's office- Surgery usually isn't the best solution- Natural, DIY creams can actually get results, using ingredients that cost pennies - Diet can be your best defense against redness, acne, fine lines, and wrinkles.<br>Dr. Anthony Youn is the rare plastic surgeon who does everything he can to keep his patients out of the operating room.

New stories and examples reflect the realities of today, from the clash with radical Islam to the deep division between &#x201c;reds&#x201d; and &#x201c;blues.&#x201d; In an era of angry finger-pointing, Colson furnishes a unique insider's perspective that can't be pigeonholed as either &#x201c;religious right&#x201d; or &#x201c;religious left.&#x201d;<br> <br> Whatever your political or religious stance, this book will give you a different understanding of Christianity. If you're a Christian, it will help you to both examine and defend your faith. If you've been critical of the new religious right, you'll be shocked at what you learn. Probing both secular and religious values, God and Government critiques each fairly, sides with neither, and offers a hopeful, fair-minded perspective that is sorely needed in today's hyper-charged atmosphere.<p>Chuck Colson was a popular and widely known author, speaker, and radio commentator.

Ezra Bayda, a remarkably down-to-earth Zen teacher, believes that the happiness "boom" has been largely a bust for readers. Why? Because it's precisely the pursuit of happiness that keeps us trapped in cycles of dissatisfaction and suffering. <br><br>In <i>Beyond Happiness</i>, Bayda draws on Zen teachings to question our conventional notions about what happiness is and where we can find it. Most of us seek happiness in things that are external to us. We imagine that getting more money, a better relationship, or going on a nice vacation will finally make us happy. But Bayda shows us that the deepest and most lasting form of happiness does not rely on external circumstance at all. Bayda offers Zen insights and practices that point readers toward the true sources of lasting happiness: mindfulness, compassion, gratitude, and generosity.</p><p>Ezra Bayda teaches at Zen Center San Diego. He is also the author of <i>Being Zen, At Home in the Muddy Water, Saying Yes to Life (Even the Hard Parts),</i> and <i>Zen Heart</i>. For more information, visit www.zencentersandiego.org.&#x201c;With compassion and humor, Ezra Bayda has graced us with ways to accept what is and to reside in it fearlessly, giving us a roadmap to enduring happiness and equanimity.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Richo, PhD, author of <i>The Five Things We Cannot Change</i> <br><br>&#x201c;A wise and deep-hearted book, a must-read for today&#x2019;s world.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roshi Joan Halifax, Upaya Zen Center <br><br> &#x201c;This book offers an extremely sane, practical, and grounded approach to the larger happiness that lies beyond conventional notions of happiness. Ezra Bayda details simple yet powerful methods both to work with mental and emotional obstacles and to cultivate well-being, and it&#x2019;s clear that his hard-won insights grow out of his own dedicated inquiry and practice. Highly recommended.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Welwood, author of <i>Toward a Psychology of Awakening</i> <br><br> &#x201c;Bayda&#x2019;s writing is straightforward and his wisdom hard-earned. When he tells us that he himself was &#x2018;born with a fairly low set point for happiness,&#x2019; you get the feeling that Bayda understands what it is that gets people stuck and, having learned a few things himself over years of practice, that his only agenda for <i>Beyond Happiness</i> is to help people find their own way. Fortunately for readers, he&#x2019;s a trustworthy guide.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Tricycle Magazine</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Bayda&#x2019;s deep understanding of his topic allows him to keep a conversational tone and tie his wisdom into everyday practices. This book is a genuine attempt to help people to see beyond their daily preoccupations and move towards a path of fulfillment.&#x201d;&#x2014;PsychCentral.com <br> <br>&#x201c;Good advice from a compassionate teacher&#x201d;&#x2014;NewAgeJournal.com<br> &#x201c;In a calm, measured prose on slowing down the aggressive, hyperactive mind, Bayda guides the reader through the helpful steps of simple meditation.

Despite beer's history, which is as old as civilization, lager is a relative newcomer, ostensibly first brewed around 500 years ago, while those pale, lively lagers that we know so well today didn't arrive until the middle of the 19th century and weren't widespread until over a hundred years later.<br>In this fascinating book, beer expert Mark Dredge dives into the history of this well-loved drink. Discover: what, exactly, a lager is; how it was first brewed and how it would have tasted; what beer was like before the birth of lager; and what role was played by German monks and kings in the creation of the drink we know so well today. From the importance of 500-year-old purity laws to a scrupulously researched exploration of modern beer gardens, Mark has delved deep into the story of the world's favorite beer.<br>From 16th Century Bavaria to the recent popularity of specialist craft lagers, <i>A Brief History of Lager </i>is an engaging and informative exploration of a classic drink.</p><p><b>Mark Dredge</b> is a writer and beer expert.

This book makes a valuable contribution to the ongoing examination of our current debt crisis, one that deserves our full attention.&#x2014;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p><p>There is a growing consensus that the planet is heading toward environmental catastrophe: climate change, ocean acidification, ozone depletion, global freshwater use, loss of biodiversity, and chemical pollution all threaten our future unless we act. What is less clear is how humanity should respond. The contemporary environmental movement is the site of many competing plans and prescriptions, and composed of a diverse set of actors, from militant activists to corporate chief executives.</p><p>This short, readable book is a sharply argued manifesto for those environmentalists who reject schemes of &#x201c;green capitalism&#x201d; or piecemeal reform. Environmental and economic scholars Magdoff and Foster contend that the struggle to reverse ecological degradation requires a firm grasp of economic reality. Going further, they argue that efforts to reform capitalism along environmental lines or rely solely on new technology to avert catastrophe misses the point. The main cause of the looming environmental disaster is the driving logic of the system itself, and those in power&#x2014;no matter how &#x201c;green&#x201d;&#x2014;are incapable of making the changes that are necessary.</p><p><em>What Every Environmentalist Needs To Know about Capitalism </em>tackles the two largest issues of our time, the ecological crisis and the faltering capitalist economy, in a way that is thorough, accessible, and sure to provoke debate in the environmental movement.</p></p><p><p><b>Fred Magdoff</b> taught at the University of Vermont in Burlington, is a director of the Monthly Review Foundation, and has written on political economy for many years.

In the opening pages of <i>The Killing of the Tinkers</i>, Jack's back in Galway a year later with a new leather jacket on his back, a pack of smokes in his pocket, a few grams of coke in his waistband, and a pint of Guinness on his mind. So much for new beginnings.</p><p>Before long he's sunk into his old patterns, lifting his head from the bar only every few days, appraising his surroundings for mere minutes and then descending deep into the alcoholic, drug-induced fugue he prefers to the real world. But a big gypsy walks into the bar one day during a moment of Jack's clarity and changes all that with a simple request. Jack knows the look in this man's eyes, a look of hopelessness mixed with resolve topped off with a quietly simmering rage; he's seen it in the mirror. Recognizing a kindred soul, Jack agrees to help him, knowing but not admitting that getting involved is going to lead to more bad than good. But in Jack Taylor's world bad and good are part and parcel of the same lost cause, and besides, no one ever accused Jack of having good sense. </p><p>Ken Bruen wowed critics and readers alike when he introduced Jack Taylor in <i>The Guards</i>; he'll blow them away with <i>The Killing of the Tinkers</i>, a novel of gritty brilliance that cements Bruen's place among the greats of modern crime fiction.</p></p><p><p>"Ken Bruen confirms his rightful place among the finest noir stylists of his generation.

She is based in Los Angeles, California.</p>The electric rice cooker has proven a popular kitchen appliance among consumers of rice as a daily diet staple. The machine&#x2019;s set-it-and-forget-it ease of operation and the superior, succulent cooked grain it produces make it a worthwhile investment. As Chin points out, the rice cooker conveniently yields perfect grains beyond simply rice. Wheat, barley, rye, quinoa, oats, millet, and more come out toothsome and never scorched. Beans, peanuts, and lentils also profit from the rice cooker&#x2019;s controlled heat. Recipes encompass all these grains as well as more complex soups, stews, and chili that use the appliance to ease both cooking and cleanup. Chin inventories and explains the array of rice cookers currently available, from the least expensive to computer-controlled induction models that employ fuzzy logic to make every grain a model of perfection. She also describes turning the cooker into a steamer to produce steamed Chinese dumplings. --Mark Knoblauch</p><h2>Celtic Design Coloring Book (Dover Design Coloring Books)</h2><p>The designs in Celtic illuminated manuscripts represent a distinctive fusion of native Irish, Germanic, and Near Eastern motifs. Graphic artist Ed Sibbett has brilliantly captured the intricacy and beauty of this original art tradition in 37 drawings based on illustrations in the Book of Durrow, the Gospels of St. Willibrord, and the illustrious Book of Kells. Among the motifs are the characteristic Celtic interlacings, geometric-animal combinations, and decorative initials, plus powerful ornaments and symbolic abstractions of animals and people.

Furthermore, the petitioner is a man without identity. The ideal antihero, he remains, as does his country, unnamed throughout the intricate plot with a locale suggestive of 1970s Cairo.<br><br>The Committee pierces the inflammatory terrain between ordinary men, unbridled displays of power, and other broader concerns of the author&#x2019;s native Egypt. The novel&#x2019;s corrosive, shocking conclusion catapults satiric surrealism into a new realm.</p><p>Sonallah Ibrahim is an Egyptian novelist and a major literary figure in the Arab world. He has published short stories, historical and scientific children's books, translations of American and German fiction, and seven novels, including Tilka al-ra' iha (The Smell of It), Beirut-Beirut, and Warda.<br><br>Mary St. Germain is head of the Near East section at the University of Washington Libraries.<br><br>Charlene Constable studied Arabic at the University of Washington and has traveled in Syria, Jordan, and Egypt.<br>She has a long-standing interest in translation.This spare, swift and ultimately chilling fantasy of interrogation and persecution in contemporary Egypt suggests that all of us are controlled by forces we often have no inkling of. The novel begins with a frustrating and unexplained interview conducted by a group known simply as the Committee. A young man is forced to belly dance, drop his pants and underwear (and worse), then to name the 20th century's most important achievement. He is also asked to write "a study on the greatest contemporary Arab luminary." The young intellectual struggles to find a subject for his project, but he soon settles on a doctor with a reputation for international philanthropy. After a year has passed, the Committee appears at his apartment to inspect his progress. Just as abruptly, they depart, leaving one of their members behind to monitor the narrator's every move, until finally he is driven to murder his observer. For this crime, the Committee sentences him to a bizarre punishment worthy of Dante. In keeping with Ibrahim's reputation as the "Egyptian Kafka," the Committee is anonymous, oppressive and symbolic of familiar social forces though recent world events will prompt readers to associate it with more specific clandestine organizations. Ibrahim (The Smell of It) creates a highly claustrophobic mood with elegant descriptions and the smooth incorporation of historical detail, bringing global depth to this work. As the dark narrative proceeds, its critique of broader social madness masquerading as civilization becomes clearer and clearer, making this a provocative addition to Ibrahim's respected oeuvre. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Christianity at the Religious Roundtable: Evangelicalism in Conversation with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam</h2><p>Argues that Christian dialogue with other faiths is an integral part of our call to proclaim the message of Christ.</p><p><p>ï¿½A vigorous, clearly-written invitation to committed Christians to enter the thought-worlds of other people.

Keenly aware of these shifts, Tennentï¿½s book encourages and facilitates just this sort of serious dialogue.

I'm simply addicted to bending wire and shaping it into creative jewelry pieces. <p>In this new book, you'll learn so much about making your own jewelry components (jump rings, earring hooks, handmade clasps, bead connectors, wire links, and more), you'll never have to buy them again. It's so much more satisfying, too, to make professional-quality jewelry from the most basic materials. People who admire my jewelry often ask me, "Where did you get the kit?" There is no kit, I tell them. I start with straight wire, beads, and charms. Occasionally I will use a commercially made clasp, but 99 percent of my jewelry is handmade by me using a few simple tools. And no soldering! No harsh chemicals! Wire-art jewelry is probably the safest and the most satisfying craft you could ever undertake. </p><p>I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did writing it.</p>Sharilyn Miller is the author of four books, including Bead on a Wire, Rubber Stamped Jewelry, The Stamp Artist's Project Book, and Stamp Art.

Using common objects like glasses, marbles, and mirrors, Cornell&#39;s work evokes the strangeness of the familiar and the odd familiarity of the strange.</p><p>Diane Waldman, a distinguished art historian and Cornell expert, was the Deputy Director and Senior Curator at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.Cornell's exquisite boxes, intimate constructions filled with found objects and collaged images, merit repeated visits just as poems call out to be read again and again, and each new Cornell book discloses something fresh and illuminating about this most magnetic and lyrical of artists. Waldman, an art historian, author, and former curator and deputy director of the Guggenheim Museum, knew Cornell and was the first to study his unique art. Now, nearly four decades later, she brings a wealth of long-brewing insights to this gorgeous volume, which boasts not only Waldman's lucid and expert commentary on Cornell's intriguing influences but also some of the finest color reproductions of his work ever published. Waldman discusses Cornell's fascination with games, Victorian imagery, ballet, movies, all things French, the young Medicis, constellations, hotels, and birds and cites the many poets and artists he revered, Dickinson and Vermeer among them. Ultimately, the profound enchantment of Cornell's poetic boxes can be attributed to their reflection of his "deeply reverential attitude toward the universe as a mirror of mysterious truths."<i> <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Yet there have been major cultural exchanges across its waters and around its shores from the third millennium B.C.E. to the present day. Historian Edward A. Alpers explores the complex issues involved in cultural exchange in the Indian Ocean Rim region over the course of this long period of time by combining a historical approach with the insights of anthropology, art history, ethnomusicology, and geography.<br><br>The Indian Ocean witnessed several significant diasporas during the past two millennia, including migrations of traders, indentured laborers, civil servants, sailors, and slaves throughout the entire basin. Persians and Arabs from the Gulf came to eastern Africa and Madagascar as traders and settlers, while Hadramis dispersed from south Yemen as traders and Muslim teachers to the Comoro Islands, Zanzibar, South India, and Indonesia. Southeast Asians migrated to Madagascar, and Chinese dispersed from Southeast Asia to the Mascarene Islands to South Africa.<br><br>Alpers also explores the cultural exchanges that diasporas cause, telling stories of identity and cultural transformation through language, popular religion, music, dance, art and architecture, and social organization. For example, architectural and decorative styles in eastern Africa, the Red Sea, the Hadramaut, the Persian Gulf, and western India reflect cultural interchanges in multiple directions. Similarly, the popular musical form of taarab in Zanzibar and coastal East Africa incorporates elements of Arab, Indian, and African musical traditions, while the characteristic frame drum (ravanne) of sï¿½ga, the widespread Afro-Creole dance of the Mascarene and Seychelles Islands, probably owes its ultimate origins to Arabia by way of Mozambique.<br><br><em>The Indian Ocean in World History </em>also discusses issues of trade and production that show the long history of exchange throughout the Indian Ocean world; politics and empire-building by both regional and European powers; and the role of religion and religious conversion, focusing mainly on Islam, but also mentioning Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity. Using a broad geographic perspective, the book includes references to connections between the Indian Ocean world and the Americas. Moving into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, Alpers looks at issues including the new configuration of colonial territorial boundaries after World War I, and the search for oil reserves.<br></p><p><br><strong>Edward A.

After decades of pressure from rural Protestants such as the hatchet-wielding Carry A. Nation and organizations such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union and Anti-Saloon League, the states ratified the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Bolstered by the Volstead Act, this amendment made Prohibition law: alcohol could no longer be produced, imported, transported, or sold. This bizarre episode is often humorously recalled, frequently satirized, and usually condemned. The more interesting questions, however, are how and why Prohibition came about, how Prohibition worked (and failed to work), and how Prohibition gave way to strict governmental regulation of alcohol. This book answers these questions, presenting a brief and elegant overview of the Prohibition era and its legacy.<br><br>During the 1920s alcohol prices rose, quality declined, and consumption dropped. The black market thrived, filling the pockets of mobsters and bootleggers. Since beer was too bulky to hide and largely disappeared, drinkers sipped cocktails made with moonshine or poor-grade imported liquor. The all-male saloon gave way to the speakeasy, where together men and women drank, smoked, and danced to jazz.<br><br>After the onset of the Great Depression, support for Prohibition collapsed because of the rise in gangster violence and the need for revenue at local, state, and federal levels. As public opinion turned, Franklin Delano Roosevelt promised to repeal Prohibition in 1932. The legalization of beer came in April 1933, followed by the Twenty-first Amendment's repeal of the Eighteenth that December. State alcohol control boards soon adopted strong regulations, and their legacies continue to influence American drinking habits. Soon after, Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith founded Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). The alcohol problem had shifted from being a moral issue during the nineteenth century to a social, cultural, and political one during the campaign for Prohibition, and finally, to a therapeutic one involving individuals. As drinking returned to pre-Prohibition levels, a Neo-Prohibition emerged, led by groups such as Mothers against Drunk Driving, and ultimately resulted in a higher legal drinking age and other legislative measures. <br><br>With his unparalleled expertise regarding American drinking patterns, W. J. Rorabaugh provides an accessible synthesis of one of the most important topics in US history, a topic that remains relevant today amidst rising concerns over binge-drinking and alcohol culture on college campuses.<br></p><p><br><strong>W.

As any educator will tell you, one of the difficult duties we face year after year, semester after semester, is the selection of texts for classes. Even in the case of literature courses that cover the writings of "dead white guys" who no longer produce literary works, there is still a continuous stream of secondary books about them and myriad analyses of their writings. In the area of writings by American Indians, this task is even more difficult because of the growing body of secondary sources, of course, but also because of the tremendous increase in the numbers of pieces of literature produced by writers of Native American descent. It is a perplexing quandary when one tries to choose from such a wonderfully rich selection. </p><p> Such difficulties also arise when one tries to compile an anthology, and there are some very good examples in print today. Some try to provide the widest coverage: an expansive array of writings from as many nations and tribal groups as possible. Some try to provide an all-inclusive sense of history: coverage from the late eighteenth century to the present. Others center on specific thematic concerns&#x2014;identity issues, political policies&#x2014;and thus narrow their scope. Some simply opt for the editors' favorites. </p><p> This present endeavor, however, cuts across the various attempts of the past, and it has one simple, perhaps obvious, guiding principle. It was our intention to compile the pieces of literature that our colleagues who teach Native American literature use time and time again. To accomplish this task, we surveyed our colleagues around the globe and asked them to give us a list of their "core" texts. The questionnaires&#x2014;sent by post and also posted on the Internet&#x2014;covered all genres and eras. Our only stipulation was that we were looking for complete works of literary art and not "excerpts," that is, sections of longer works, like novels, which rarely stand as discrete units of art. (There are short stories included here that became novel chapters later.) The response was wonderful, and although there were some obviously central authors listed on significant numbers of questionnaires, there was also a great diversity in the recommendations they made. </p><p> This may seem to be a very self-serving effort: to create the anthology we always wanted to have. To a degree, this is true, but primarily this book is an attempt to construct an effective introductory collection to written Native literature. In our questionnaire, we asked for lists of pieces used most often because "they work." We did not get into a lengthy attempt to define this vague qualifier, believing that every educator knows when something has a profound, productive effect on a class, an audience. We simply wanted to bring together literary pieces that have this effect, because we also realize that the students who read these pieces of literature in the myriad courses our colleagues teach at a wide array of public and private institutions around the globe constitute the reading public itself; they come from every element of society, cutting across every group distinction employed in the world today: class, gender, race, and political ideology, to name just a few. Nonetheless, the literature speaks personally and compellingly to them, and that is a remarkable achievement. </p><p> We truly hope it speaks to you, the current reader, as well. Acknowledgments </p><p> We want to thank all the people who have made this anthology possible, including all our colleagues around the world who took the time to answer our survey and thus provided the list of works they find most useful in their courses. We would also like to thank Steven Beech, who tracked these works down, and our editor, Carrie Brandon, for helping us realize our goal. Finally, however, our greatest appreciation goes to the Native American writers and storytellers who have made such remarkable contributions to the literary arts and enriched our society with their myriad voices and their illuminating insights. </p><p> We would also like to thank the reviewers of our manuscript for their input on this anthology: Jacquelyn Kilpatrick, Ph.D., Governors State University; Gloria Lynn Larrieu, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute; Louis Roma-Deeley, Paradise Valley Community College; Patrick Clark Smith, University of New Mexico; and Norma Clark Wilson, University of South Dakota.</p><p>&#x2014; John Purdy,<br> James Ruppert</p><p>AN ANTHOLOGY THAT features both classic and contemporary Native American Literatures, <b>Nothing But The Truth</b> is a healthy collection of the best works of Native American Literature.

In <i>The Constitution of Society</i> he outlines the distinctive position he has evolved during that period and offers a full statement of a major new perspective in social thought, a synthesis and elaboration of ideas touched on in previous works but described here for the first time in an integrated and comprehensive form. A particular feature is Giddens's concern to connect abstract problems of theory to an interpretation of the nature of empirical method in the social sciences. In presenting his own ideas, Giddens mounts a critical attack on some of the more orthodox sociological views. <i>The Constitution of Society</i> is an invaluable reference book for all those concerned with the basic issues in contemporary social theory.</p><p>"It is likely that this book will be regarded as the most important piece of grand sociological theory in English of the past decade."&#x2015;Mark Poster, University of California<br><br>"This book will take its place alongside such major statements of sociological theory as those of Parsons and Habermas.

Salda-a presents twenty folk tales drawn from the oral traditions of Hispanics, Native Americans, Asians and Pacific Islanders, Africans, and African Americans. He encourages teachers to use the literature as a framework and springboard for pantomime and verbal improvisation, adding detailed methods for dramatizations, with follow-up activities in the social studies and language arts. In these dramas, you and your students will find not only the commonalities that link all human beings, but also the special values, symbols, and traditions that differentiate and distinguish us as individuals and groups. </p></p><p>Theatre is often perceived as elitist, something reserved for the affluent mainstream. But all children can be given the opportunity to explore dramatic art if individual teachers choose to integrate these experiences into their curriculum. Johnny Saldana&#39;s Drama of Color is a unique resource for using drama to enhance K-6 children&#39;s ethnic literacy by provoking personal insights into the multiethnic world in which we live. Multiethnic folklore - specifically Hispanic, Native American, Asian and Pacific Islander, and African/African American - becomes a springboard for examining different ethnic perspectives and world views and dispelling stereotypes along the way.<p>Johnny Saldana is a professor of theatre at Arizona State University in Tempe, where he supervises theatre education and teacher training.

[<i>The Hamlet Fire</i>] will provide readers with insights into our current national politics."<br> <em>The Washington Post</em> <br><br>A "gifted writer" (<em>Chicago Tribune</em>) uses a long forgotten factory fire in small-town North Carolina to show how cut-rate food and labor have become the new American norm<br></b><p>For decades, the small, quiet town of Hamlet, North Carolina, thrived thanks to the railroad. But by the 1970s, it had become a postindustrial backwater, a magnet for businesses searching for cheap labor with little or almost no official oversight. One of these businesses was Imperial Food Products. The company paid its workers a dollar above the minimum wage to stand in pools of freezing water for hours on end, scraping gobs of fat off frozen chicken breasts before they got dipped in batter and fried into golden brown nuggets and tenders. If a worker complained about the heat or the cold or missed a shift to take care of their children or went to the bathroom too often they were fired. But they kept coming back to work because Hamlet was a place where jobs were scarce. Then, on the morning of September 3, 1991, the day after Labor Day, this factory that had never been inspected burst into flame. Twenty-five people&#x2014;many of whom were black women with children, living on their own&#x2014;perished that day behind the plant&#x2019;s locked and bolted doors.</p> <p>Eighty years after the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, industrial disasters were supposed to have been a thing of the past. After spending several years talking to local residents, state officials, and survivors of the fire, award-winning historian Bryant Simon has written a vivid, potent, and disturbing social autopsy of this town, this factory, and this time that shows how cheap labor, cheap government, and cheap food came together in a way that was bound for tragedy.</p></p><p><strong>Bryant Simon</strong> is a professor of history at Temple University. He is the author of <em>Boardwalk of Dreams: Atlantic City and the Fate of Urban America</em>, and <em>Everything but the Coffee: Learning About America from Starbucks</em>.

He lives in Philadelphia.<b>Praise for <em>Hamlet Fire</em>:</b><br>"This gripping and moving account of what happened and why goes far beyond what Morgan Spurlock attempts in his new documentary about the chicken industry."<br> <b><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> </b><br><br>"It is testament to Simon&#x2019;s reportorial instincts and research that he has found this sprawling. . . story in the detritus of that now-forgotten fire.

As his meticulously researched examination of the 1991 Hamlet fire makes so painfully clear, real people&#x2014;overwhelmingly poor and disproportionately black people&#x2014;pay a high price indeed for this nation&#x2019;s insatiable desire for cheap food and cheap government. But thanks to Simon&#x2019;s careful reconstruction of the forces and circumstances that led so many to suffer in this one tiny North Carolina town, as well as his searing analysis of why those who lived and worked there mattered so little, readers are left with only one conclusion: America finally must commit itself to decent wages, safe workplaces, sufficient health care, and everything else that human beings need.

Sifting through the wreckage, he unearths story after story of the unsustainable cost of cheap: a reckless economy, a cut-rate government, factory food, and disposable lives. Simon&#x2019;s forensics are written with force, clarity, and gripping detail. <em>The Hamlet Fire</em> is a heartbreaking history of the hollowing out of the American dream."<br> <b>Jefferson Cowie, author of <em>Stayin&#x2019; Alive: The 1970s and the Last Days of the Working Class</em></b><br> <br>"What appears cheap comes at an expensive cost&#x2014;often life itself if life itself is worth valuing. But lives in the United States&#x2014;especially poor Black lives&#x2014;are as cheap as the food and the government that is not sustaining those lives, Bryant Simon reveals in absorbing prose and striking analysis. <em>The Hamlet Fire</em> presents the smoldering death day of those twenty-five small town North Carolinians not as an industrial accident. Simon heroically presents this tragedy as a regularity in the unknown life of present-day industrial America where &#x2018;cheap&#x2019; lives lavishly and valued life is dead. <em>The Hamlet Fire</em> is an oracle."<br> <b>Ibram X.

It&#x2019;s also the story of a community that&#x2019;s fallen through the cracks of the prelapsarian American Dream, a community of people who read like tragic characters from a literary novel.

This groundbreaking biography examines the private life behind Arbus's controversial art. The book deals with Arbus's pampered Manhattan childhood, her passionate marriage to Allan Arbus, their work together as fashion photographers, the emotional upheaval surrounding the end of their marriage, and the radical, liberating, and ultimately tragic turn Arbus's art took during the 1960s when she was so richly productive. This edition includes a new afterword by Patricia Bosworth that covers the phenomenon of Arbus since her death, the latest Arbus scholarship, and a view of the first major retrospective of Arbus's work as well as notes on the forthcoming motion picture based on her story. Bosworth's engrossing book is a portrait of a woman who drastically altered our sense of what is permissible in photography. 26 illustrations</p><p>Opportunities for sensationalism abound in a book about Arbus, who already had a history of severe depressions and a crumbling marriage by the time she began to take the controversial, technically innovative pictures of dwarfs, nudists and drag queens that won her a reputation as &#34;a photographer of freaks.&#34; Bosworth balances the lurid details -- rumors that Arbus had sex with her subjects, that she photographed her own suicide in 1971 -- with a nuanced appraisal of an artist whose images captured the uneasy mood of the 1960s by expressing her personal obsessions.Patricia Bosworth is the author of biographies of Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando.

Incredibly efficient at converting almost any organic matter into nourishing, delectable protein, swine are nothing short of a gastronomic godsendyet their flesh is banned in many cultures, and the animals themselves are maligned as filthy, lazy brutes. <br>As historian Mark Essig reveals in "Lesser Beasts," swine have such a bad reputation for precisely the same reasons they are so valuable as a source of food: they are intelligent, self-sufficient, and omnivorous. What s more, he argues, we ignore our historic partnership with these astonishing animals at our peril. Tracing the interplay of pig biology and human culture from Neolithic villages 10,000 years ago to modern industrial farms, Essig blends culinary and natural history to demonstrate the vast importance of the pig and the tragedy of its modern treatment at the hands of humans. Pork, Essig explains, has long been a staple of the human diet, prized in societies from Ancient Rome to dynastic China to the contemporary American South. Yet pigs ability to track down and eat a wide range of substances (some of them distinctly unpalatable to humans) and convert them into edible meat has also led people throughout history to demonize the entire species as craven and unclean. Today s unconscionable system of factory farming, Essig explains, is only the latest instance of humans taking pigs for granted, and the most recent evidence of how both pigs and people suffer when our symbiotic relationship falls out of balance. <br>An expansive, illuminating history of one of our most vital yet unsung food animals, "Lesser Beasts" turns a spotlight on the humble creature that, perhaps more than any other, has been a mainstay of civilization since its very beginningswhether we like it or not."</p><p>Mark Essig holds a PhD in US History from Cornell and is the author of &#34;Edison and the Electric Chair.&#34; He lives in Asheville, North Carolina."An enlightening culinary history.... A lively, informative farm-to-table feast."<br>--"Kirkus Reviews" <br>"What Mark Kurlansky did for "Cod," Essig might just do for swine."<br>--"Shelf Awareness" <br>"Essig presents an entertaining perspective on pigs, especially as they relate to humans. After you read this book, pigs will never seem quite the same."<br>--"Library Journal" <br>"A thoughtful book about the fascinating relationship between pigs and people, from Leviticus to "Charlotte's Web." I learned something new on every page: Essig has a knack for delivering reams of information with lightness and wit, even as he makes an eloquent plea for a reformed pork industry, one where the bacon we eat comes from 'a pig that lived like a pig.' Whether you eat pork or not, "Lesser Beasts" is a gripping meditation on the plight of pigs."<br>--Bee Wilson, author of "Consider the Fork" <br>"Forget the egg. It's the pig that's incredible and edible. And Mark Essig tells the remarkable animal's checkered history with a style and verve that's as irresistible as bacon itself."<br>--John Donohue, editor of "Man with a Pan: Culinary Adventures of Fathers who Cook for their Families" <br>"Mark Essig tells a fine tale of the unsung exploits of the lowly pig, from the age of the pyramids and the wars of the conquistadors to the awful abattoirs and trendy restaurants of today. With clear prose and careful research, he redeems an animal that has played a seminal role in human history while enduring near universal disdain. This fascinating book provides a marvelous antidote to our unexamined views on the pig."<br>--Andrew Lawler, author of "Why Did the Chicken Cross the World? The Epic Saga of the Bird that Powers Civilization" <br>"Lesser Beasts is a delightful romp through porcine history from the Neolithic era to the present. Mark Essig offers surprising answers to the question of why humans have had such a love-hate affair with the humble pig, and unveils many other unexpected insights.

The sense of paranoia, of persecution by a foe or force that is never given a name, evokes <i>The Trial</i> by Kafka, a writer with whom Kavan is often compared, although her deeply personal, restrained, and almost foreign&nbsp; &#x2014;accented style has no true model. The same characters who recur throughout&#x2014;the protagonist's unhelpful "adviser," the friend and lover who abandons her at the clinic, and an assortment of deluded companions&#x2014;are sketched without a trace of the rage, self-pity, or sentiment that have marked more recent accounts of mental instability.</p><p><strong>Anna Kavan was one of the greatest unsung enigmas in 20th-century British literature. Born Helen Ferguson, a fraught childhood and two failed marriages led her to change her name to that of one of her characters. Despite struggling with mental illness and heroin addiction for most of her life, she was still able to write fiction that was as powerful and memorable as any English female writer of the last 150 years.</strong></p><h2>Cape Diamond: A Frank Yakabuski Mystery</h2><p><p>Cape Diamond, the second book in the Frank Yakabuski Mystery series, is atmospheric and action-packed. Set near the Northern Divide &#x2015; as was the first installment, Edgar Award nominee (Best Paperback Original), Ragged Lake &#x2015; the book opens with Yakabuski called to investigate a gruesome crime scene. A body has been left hanging from a schoolyard fence. On closer inspection, Yak finds a large diamond in the murder victim&#x2019;s mouth. </p> <p>Two criminal gangs &#x2015; the Shiners and the Travellers &#x2015; are fighting with each other, and Yakabuski turns to his father, a now-retired detective who has a long history with the gangs, for advice in the interrogation. Is the conflict over the murder of two men? The kidnapping of a little girl? Or, possibly, the diamond found in Augustus Morrissey&#x2019;s mouth? As if this weren&#x2019;t enough for one detective, a serial killer is taking a deadly road trip through the United States, heading towards the Northern Divide. </p> <p>Ron Corbett weaves the various strands together with ingenuity, making Cape Diamond a brooding, suspense-filled story of hubris, betrayal, and evil deeds; his writing is sparse and taut, compelling the reader to follow the action and gang conflict to a surprise ending.</p></p><p><b>Ron Corbett</b> is an author, journalist, and broadcaster living in Ottawa.

The field was on the west end of an escarpment that soared high above the Springfield River, and each worker would have left a high-rise apartment, lunch pail and coffee thermos in hand, then taken the shortcut across the sports field to be standing at the Sleigh Bay bus stop by 5:45 a.m.</p><br> <p>The sun appeared that morning at 6:41, and so the men walked in the dark. Likely they walked with their heads down and eyes to the ground, in no hurry to greet the day, as they were shift workers heading to the O&#x2019;Hearn sawmill on Sleigh Bay.</p><br> <p>They could have missed it. When the workers were tracked down by police later that day &#x2015; there were nine in total, all men &#x2015; not one was interviewed for more than five minutes.</p><br> <p>Next to cross the field were early-morning workers on their way to the city of Springfield: file clerks and security guards, dishwashers and parking lot attendants, construction labourers and split-shift bus drivers. By the time these workers crossed, the sun was in the sky, a winter sun that would have been more white than yellow, that would have shone through the birch and spruce at the edge of the escarpment and the canyon openings between the high-rise apartment buildings, casting shadows that would have lain directly in their path. Police were able to track down twenty-two of these workers. Each was interviewed at length. No one remembered seeing anything unusual about the east-side fence of Filion&#x2019;s Field that morning.</p><br> <p>The last to cross were children, taking another shortcut, this one leading to a cut-opening in the fence and beyond that a trail through the woods that brought them to Northwood Elementary School. It was hard to get an accurate number for the children. Police estimated there could have been as many as thirty.</p><br> <p>During first recess, a half-dozen boys returned to Filion&#x2019;s Field and that was when a police officer spotted them, throwing rocks at something tied to the fence, a target of some sort. The rocks arced in the air. The boys laughed. By then, the sun had risen high enough to be shining directly through the chain-link fence that surrounded the field, casting geometric shadows on the soccer pitch that replicated the metal mesh.</p><br> <p>The cop&#x2019;s name was Donna Griffin, a young cop who had come to the North Shore projects to serve a family court warrant. She watched the boys, trying to figure out what game they were playing. Eventually, she started walking toward them. When she was spotted, the boys turned as one, like a herd of deer spotting a hunter. Then they took off as one, heading toward the hole in the fence and the path beyond.</p><br> <p>The cop knew better than to give chase, as there was no way she was going to catch those boys. A couple of them had looked fast enough to make All City. She watched them disappear into the woods, and before the last child&#x2019;s back vanished, she realized no boy had turned to yell at her. Not one jeer or taunt when it was obvious she was not giving chase. A half-dozen boys. From the North Shore projects.</p><br> <p>She kept walking. Was halfway across the pitch when the object tethered to the fence began to take shape, began to occupy time and space and become a thing defined. She stopped fifteen feet short of the object. The shadows fell across her, not in the pattern of chain-link, but as two large intersecting lines. She stared up at the fence and found herself wishing she had chased those boys.</p></p><h2>The Bandera Trail: The Trail Drive, Book 4 (The Trail Drive, 4)</h2><p><p><b>From bestselling author Ralph Compton&#x2015;the extraordinary saga of a death-defying mission across the Texas border into the blazing heart of the Mexican war...</b></p><p> There are a thousand ways to die on a trail drive through Mexico.

Through the lens of her relatives&#x2019; momentous lives, Buckley examines major events throughout American history. From Atlanta during Reconstruction and the rise of Jim Crow, to New York City during the Harlem Renaissance, and then from World War II to the Civil Rights Movement, this ambitious, brilliant family witnessed and participated in the most crucial events of the 19th and 20th centuries. Combining personal and national history, <i>The Black Calhouns</i> is a unique and vibrant portrait of six generations during dynamic times of struggle and triumph.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2016:</strong> That racism runs deep in American culture is not, perhaps, news--but while this compelling memoir/history of several generations of one African American family makes that clear, it also chronicles the way periods of possibility for black Americans have been interspersed with the ascendance of such organizations as the Ku Klux Klan and even, some of the attitudes that persist today. But while Buckley&#x2019;s book is a fascinating history, it is no textbook; it&#x2019;s also the very personal story of several generations of her own family. Among Buckley&#x2019;s ancestors: Moses Calhoun, who became a well-to-do Atlanta businessman after emancipation--he&#x2019;d been taught to read by his master who wanted a &#x201c;sophisticated&#x201d; butler. And, more famously, Buckley&#x2019;s mother, the actress Lena Horne, who grew up to be a singer and movie star but began life at a Jewish lying-in hospital in Brooklyn because her mother was passing as white. Buckley&#x2019;s tales are fascinating and her straightforward style winning. This is not just an important book. It&#x2019;s also an enthralling one. <em>--Sara Nelson</em><b>Gail Lumet Buckley</b> is the author of the national bestsellers <i>American Patriots: The Story of Blacks in the Military from the Revolution to Desert Storm</i>, and <i>The Hornes: An American Family</i>, which became a PBS "American Masters" documentary.

A patrician figure not known for eloquence, Bush dismissed ideology as "the vision thing." Yet, as Timothy Naftali argues, no one of his generation was better prepared for the challenges facing the United States as the Cold War ended. Bush wisely encouraged the liberalization of the Soviet system and skillfully orchestrated the reunification of Germany.

His toughest decisions widened fractures in the Republican Party, and with his party divided, Bush lost his bid for reelection in 1992.

He winds up back in the US with his legs full of pins, daily rations of Librium and Valium, and no sense of what to do next. One evening, on the tail of a rainstorm, he limps off the bus and into the small town of Boone, determined to find a real job and a real bed&#x2013;but no matter how hard he works, nothing muffles the anguish in his mind and body. Brilliantly and vividly written, <b>Paco&#x2019;s Story</b>&#x2013;winner of a National Book Award&#x2013;plunges you into the violence and casual cruelty of the Vietnam War, and the ghostly aftermath that often dealt the harshest blows.</p><p>Paco Sullivan arrives in town penniless and job-hunting, the rain evaporating off the street forming "pungent steam so thick you would think his legs were cut off at the knees."

Carl Safina's guide and inspiration is an albatross he calls Amelia, whose life and far-flung flights he describes in fascinating detail. Interwoven with recollections of whalers and famous explorers, <i>Eye of the Albatross</i> probes the unmistakable environmental impact of the encounters between man and marine life.

He lives in Amagansett, New York.</p>Eye of the Albatross<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>PRELUDE<i>W</i>HEN THE WIND DROPS in late afternoon, Amelia, already hundreds of miles from land, rises on her own power, flapping more than she'd prefer. With her breast muscles pulling on the long bones of her wings, those wings biting like propellers to pull her through the air, she is using up more of the energy she's here to replenish. After rising on a small gust of breeze, Amelia lets gravity take over the work again, gliding downward and forward like a wind-driven snowflake. When her flight line dips, her wing tip traces a thin line on the sea, leaving her spare signature upon the waters. This evanescent track, the only mark of her passage, vanishes in moments, fleeting as her presence here in a body built to move only forward.When the wind returns, she sets her wings and, without anything perceivable as bodily movement, continues for another hundred miles, flying in long undulations on the propellant energy of the breeze. Hers is the billowy motion of a life under sail. As Archibald MacLeish wrote, "A poem should be wordless as the flight of birds"; and so Amelia is a kind of living poetry upon the ocean.&nbsp;<br>THESE IMMENSE CREATURES we call "albatross" are the greatest long-distance wanderers on Earth. Big birds in big oceans, albatrosses lead big, sprawling lives across space and time, traveling to the limits of seemingly limitless seas. They accomplish these distances by wielding the impressive--wondrous, really--body architecture of creatures built to glide indefinitely.The physics of an albatross's wing differs from that of most other birds, whose bodies are designed for powered flight. That is because albatrosses are constructed more to float in the air than to fly. Compared tomany other birds, which power flight with elongated "hand" bones, the proportions of an albatross wing are humanlike--long arm bones, short "hand" bones--almost as though humans were also meant to glide. Or as if, were we suddenly transformed into birds, we would most naturally become albatrosses.Our physical parallels with albatrosses suggest our metaphorical relatedness. In Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," the sailor who kills an albatross is compelled to wear around his neck the evidence of his crime against nature. Even two centuries ago, the bird symbolized good luck and beneficent companionship, harmed only at our peril--a seabird with power enough to convey a universal cautionary tale. Coleridge, who never saw an albatross, sensed this. We sense it still.Many of us harbor a different metaphorical albatross within. Beneath the daily overburden, our truer nature is this wandering spirit on expansive wings, hungering for a chance to search new horizons, to hurtle along with the wind, taking chances, taking the world as it comes, making tracks that will endure only in our memory, forming our personal map of life and time.&nbsp;<br>AN ALBATROSS is a great symphony of flesh, perception, bone, and feathers, composed of long movements and set to ever-changing rhythms of light, wind, water. The almost overwhelming <i>musicality</i> of an albatross in air derives not just from the bird itself but from the contrapuntal suite of action and inaction from which this creature composes flight. It drifts in the atmosphere at high speed, but itself remains immobile--an immense bird holding stock-still yet shooting through the wind. Just as individual notes become music by relationship to other notes, the bird's stillness becomes movement by context. Following your traveling ship with ease, watching you, circling stern to prow and back at will, it flies with scarcely a flinch, skimming wave upon wave, mile after mile. Watching it, you invariably wonder, <i>How</i> can it do that?Exerting no propelling power of its own over long distances, it is driven by the tension between the two greatest forces on our planet: gravity and the solar-powered wind. An albatross's flight relies on exploiting what all other flying creatures struggle to overcome. By working <i>with</i> wind and gravity, its flight surpasses all others'. That it holds still while being propelled by invisible forces may be why painters so rarely attempt the albatross, though it is one of the sea's greatest conceptual icons. The author and wildlife painter Richard Ellis explains, "An albatrossis motion, and capturing it is too daunting for most artists working in fixed media." Indeed, watch an albatross speeding over the ocean to streak across your wake; it does not so much fly as pilot the great body it inhabits. Exquisitely so.Albatross flight looks easy. You have no idea. A Wandering Albatross's heart actually beats slower during flight than while sitting on the sea. Black-browed Albatrosses use no more energy while flying than when brooding a chick upon their nest. Scientists who studied metabolic efficiency in Gray-headed Albatrosses at sea discovered "the lowest cost of flight yet measured." Here's one of the birds' secrets: for the long hours and days of flying, albatrosses needn't really hold their wings out; using an extraordinary wing lock at the shoulder and an elbow lock for rigidity, they snap them into the unfolded position like opened switchblades.The huge birds' placid mastery of gales never fails to impress mariners distressed by heavy weather. Charles Darwin, in a tempest near Cape Horn while aboard the <i>Beagle</i> in 1833, wrote, "Whilst we were heavily laboring, it was curious to see how the Albatross ... glided right up the wind." Not far from there a few years ago, in a storm so great it stopped our 270-foot ship for a day, I too watched albatrosses somehow gliding directly into seventy-knot winds in hurricane conditions, circling our paralyzed ship with surreal serenity, seeming oblivious to the shrieking, spume-filled gusts. When the fascinated nineteenth-century sea captain Jean-Marie LeBris killed an albatross and held its wing in the breeze, the lift it generated so astonished him that he suddenly "comprehended the whole mystery of flight." Later, in Brittany, he built out of wood and cloth a "winged boat" named, of course, <i>Albatross.</i> On a Sunday in 1856 his device was mounted on a horse-drawn cart and driven downhill at a gallop. The craft rose a hundred meters into the air--with LeBris at the controls. Modern aviation awaited only invention of an engine capable of powering such an aircraft.While mariners marveled at the sheer size and stamina of albatrosses for centuries, the birds' oceanic travels were impossible to cipher. Where did they go? Sailors speculated, and some came close. Scientists guessed wrong. No one could have fully imagined, because albatrosses exert almost unimaginable lives.In the last few years albatrosses have been tracked by Earth-orbiting satellites, and their true travels outdistance all previous conjecture. Before maturing, albatrosses remain at sea for years, never alightingupon a solid surface, perhaps not even glimpsing land all the while. During their whole lifespan they expend 95 percent of their existence at sea--flying most of that time. Theirs is a fluid world of wind and wild waters, everything in perpetual motion. Land is little more than a necessary inconvenience for breeding. When they do breed, albatrosses haunt only the most removed islands, hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles from any continent. And even at the most isolated island groups, albatrosses often choose to nest on the tiniest offshore islets, as though they can't tolerate too much land. When need compels them to return to a remote isle to feed a famished chick, an albatross may make round-trip foraging treks of several thousand miles, sleeping aloft, foraging in darkness and daylight, searching out food enough for a single feeding for their single offspring (a large, ravenous chick may wait two weeks for a meal). And so they span long stretches of space and time, distant from any shore, seldom within sight of a coast, embedded in the breeze. Doing so, they cover distances equivalent to flying around the Earth at the equator three times every year. A fifty-year-old albatross has flown, at minimum, 3.7 million miles.Albatrosses are creatures of air inside and out; air sacs surround their organs and extend even into their hollow wing bones. An albatross's entire skeleton accounts for only 13 percent of the bird's total weight. You expect massive flight muscles, and again these birds surprise you. In most birds, flight muscle accounts for about 16 percent of body weight, but most albatrosses' flight muscles amount to only 9 percent of body mass; in the great Royal and Wandering Albatrosses, flight muscle is a paltry 6 percent, with very reduced biceps. These creatures are <i>gliding</i> machines. More than anything, albatrosses' long, narrow wings make them extreme-range mileage mechanisms. The ratio of wingspan to wing width of a Wandering Albatross is 18 to 1, similar to the best-perfected human-made gliders. Their wings' lift-to-drag ratio--lifting force to air resistance--is a remarkable 40 to 1, more than triple that of many eagles.Although exquisite at mining energy from the weather, the gigantic Royal and Wandering Albatrosses are gliding-adapted to a fault; they are incapable of sustained flapping flight. Calm weather leaves them stranded on the sea surface. Their existence utterly depends on the prospect that the winds will continue blowing. Fortunately for them, wind remains plentiful, at least for now. Indeed, albatrosses as we know them could only have evolved in the windiest place on Earth--the Southern Ocean, where an abundant supply of moving air breathed creation into Life's most surpassing capacity for flight.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>ALMOST EVERYTHING about albatrosses is superlative and extreme. Extreme in size, in duration, in endurance. Even the smallest species have six-foot wingspreads. Wandering and Royal Albatrosses wield the longest wings in nature--over eleven feet tip to tip. Wandering Albatrosses weigh up to twenty-six pounds--twice the weight of the largest Bald Eagles; that's a very large flying creature. Wanderer chicks grow to as much as thirty-three pounds--larger than adults--before losing weight prior to fledging. After taking years to mature, an albatross embarks upon courtship and "engagement," which can last two full years or longer. Royals and Wanderers first breed as late as age thirteen. Their single egg, which can weigh over a pound, requires more than two months' incubation. Mates take shifts on the nest. Albatrosses whose mates fail to return may sit incubating, waiting, for unimaginably extreme lengths of time. If the mate deserts or dies, a bird may sit on an egg for two months, losing a third of its weight before hunger drives it to sea. One albatross whose mate failed to return faithfully incubated an infertile egg for 108 days. The death of a mate costs the survivor one to four full breeding cycles, because a new courtship takes years. Breeding stretches at least eight months; some albatross species require a full year to raise a chick. During that whole time from egg to fledger, mates may spend only five to ten days together. Many albatrosses breed only every other year; Light-mantled Sooty Albatrosses raise one chick every three or four years--the lowest reproductive rate of any bird.The longest wings in nature--Wandering AlbatrossFor creatures with such extraordinarily slow reproduction--their exceptionally long reproductive lives constitute a life pattern closer to humans' than virtually any other animal--the continuity of their race depends on equally extraordinary adult survival from year to year. Like a human's, an albatross's lifetime may endure for many decades. The oldest albatross found--and probably the oldest known marked wild bird--was a Royal still living at over sixty years of age. Some believe that the maximum albatross life span may approach the century mark. No one yet knows, because they haven't been studied that long.In addition to sharing similarities with us, albatrosses living so far from humanity increasingly share a human-dominated destiny. Because they range so far and live so long, albatrosses intersect and contend with almost every effect that people exert upon the sea. Forged in the elemental world of wind, water, weather, and other wildlife, the albatross inhabits a realm that has come to encompass everything from fishing boats to human-caused climate changes. Everything people are doing to oceans, albatrosses feel.&nbsp;<br>"I NOW BELONG to a higher cult of mortals, for I have seen the albatross!" exalted the American ornithologist Robert Cushman Murphy during his first trip to the South Atlantic, in 1912. Being near these birds touches people with something so profound it seems spiritual. Returning from several Wandering Albatross nests on a subantarctic island one morning, one of my companions remarked, "I feel like I've been to church." My first experience among nesting Royal Albatrosses on New Zealand's Campbell Island had caught me off guard, too, seeming less like the expected visit and more like an audience with beings who did not merely occupy but somehow <i>populated</i> the place. They seemed to give the island its rationale, embodying the slow sweep of deep time in the splendor of their magisterial seascape. Before I turned my back to walk downhill, the nest inspection had become a pilgrimage. Being in their presence infused a penetrating sensation each of us later described with the same word: <i>serenity</i>. The eminent ornithologist Dr. Frank Gill, who has studied birds throughout the world, remembered this from a day observing nesting Wanderers: "There was such wisdom in those beautiful eyes that have seen so many years. In all my lifetime of experiences with birds, no moment was so moving."During their prodigious travels albatrosses cross paths with a spectacular array of creatures near the ocean surface, including other seabirds, fishes, whales, sharks, sea turtles, seals, and some extraordinary people. Following albatrosses will enlarge your life, and they will be sure to introduce you to the splendid company they keep; all truly awesome envoys of the magnificence of life on this ocean planet.&nbsp;<br><i>Amelia's Realm</i>Copyright ï¿½ 2002 by Carl Safina</p><h2>Dorchester Terrace: A Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Novel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;[A] magic kingdom of Victorian murder and intrigue.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Thomas Pitt is now the powerful head of Britain&#x2019;s Special Branch, and some people fear that he may have been promoted beyond his abilities.

Pitt stood up from his desk and walked over to turn the gas up on the wall lamps one by one. He was becoming used to this office, even if he was not yet comfortable in it. In his mind it still belonged to Victor Narraway.<br><br>When he turned back to his desk he half expected to see the pencil drawings of bare trees that Narraway used to keep on the walls, instead of the watercolors of skies and seascapes that Charlotte had given him. His books were not so different from Narraway&#x2019;s. There was less poetry, fewer classics perhaps, but similar titles on history, politics, and law.<br><br>Narraway had of course taken with him the large, silver-framed picture of his mother. Today, Pitt had finally put in its place his favorite photograph of his family. In it, Charlotte is smiling; beside her stands thirteen-year-old Jemima, looking very grown-up, and ten-year-old Daniel, still with the soft face of a child.<br><br>After the fiasco in Ireland at the end of last year, 1895, Narraway had not been reinstated as head of Special Branch, though he had been exonerated of all charges, of course. Instead, Pitt&#x2019;s temporary status as head had been made official. Even though it had happened several months earlier, he still found it hard to get used to. And he knew very well that the men who had once been his superiors, then his equals, and now his juniors, also found the new situation trying at best. Rank, in and of itself, meant little. His title commanded obedience, but not loyalty.<br><br>So far they had obeyed him without question. But he had had several months of very predictable events to deal with. There had been only the usual rumblings of discontent among the various immigrant populations, particularly here in London, but no crises. None of the difficult situations that endangered lives and tested his judgment. If such a crisis were to occur, it was then, he suspected, that he might find his men&#x2019;s trust in him strained and tenuous.<br><br>Pitt stopped by the window, staring out at the pattern of the opposite rooftops and the elegant wall of the nearby building, just able to discern their familiar outlines in the fading light. The bright gleam of streetlamps was increasing in all directions.<br><br>He pictured Narraway&#x2019;s grave face as it had been when they last spoke: tired and deeply lined, the effect of his difficult escape from total disgrace and from the emotional toll of his experiences in Ireland. Pitt knew that Narraway had accepted, at last, the existence of his feelings for Charlotte; but as always, Victor&#x2019;s coal-black eyes had given little away as they talked.<br><br>&#x201c;You will make mistakes,&#x201d; he had said to Pitt in the quietness of this room, with its view of sky and rooftops. &#x201c;You will hesitate to act when you know it could hurt people or destroy a life. Do not hesitate too long. You will misjudge people; you&#x2019;ve always thought better of your social superiors than you should have. For God&#x2019;s sake, Pitt, rely on your instincts. Sometimes the results of your decisions will be serious. Live with it. The measure of your worth is what you learn from the errors you make. You cannot opt out; that would be the worst mistake of all.&#x201d; His face had been grim, shadowed by memories. &#x201c;It is not only the decision you make that counts, but that you make it at the right moment. Anything that threatens the peace and safety of Britain can come under your jurisdiction.&#x201d;<br><br>Narraway had not added &#x201c;God help you,&#x201d; though he might as well have. Then a dry humor had softened his eyes for a moment. Pitt had seen a flicker of compassion there for the burden that lay ahead, and also a hint of envy, regret for the excitement lost, the pounding of the blood and the fire of the mind that Narraway was being forced to give up.<br><br>Of course, Pitt had seen him since then, but only briefly. There had been social events here and there, conversations that were polite, but devoid of meaning beyond the courtesies. The questions as to how each of them was learning to bend, to adapt and alter his stride to a new role, remained unspoken.<br><br>Pitt sat down again at his desk and turned his attention to the papers in front of him.<br><br>There was a brief knock on the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The door opened at once, and Stoker entered. Thanks to the events in Ireland, he was the one man in the Branch that Pitt knew for certain he could trust.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; he said as Stoker came to stand in front of Pitt&#x2019;s desk. He looked worried and uncomfortable, his lean face more expressive than usual.<br><br>&#x201c;Got a report in from Hutchins in Dover, sir. Seen one or two unusual people coming over on the ferry. Troublemakers. Not the usual sort of political talkers&#x2014;more like the ones who really do things. He&#x2019;s pretty sure at least one of them was involved in the murder of the French prime minister the year before last.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt felt a knot tighten in his stomach. No wonder Stoker looked so worried. &#x201c;Tell him to do all he can to be absolutely sure of their identities,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Send Barker down as well. Watch the trains. We need to know if any of them come up to London, and who they contact if they do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It may be nothing,&#x201d; Stoker said without conviction. &#x201c;Hutchins is a bit jumpy.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt drew in his breath to say that it was Hutchins&#x2019;s job to be overcautious, then changed his mind. Stoker knew that as well as he did. &#x201c;Still, we should keep our eyes open. We&#x2019;ve enough men in Dover to do that, with Barker.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>Stoker turned and left. Pitt sat without moving for a moment or two. If it really was one of the French prime minister&#x2019;s assassins, would the French police or secret service get in touch with him? Would they want his help, or prefer to deal with the man themselves? They might hope to get information about other anarchists from him. Or, on the other hand, they might simply contrive for him to meet with an accident, so the whole matter would never reach the public eye. If the latter were the case, it would be better if the British Special Branch pretended not to be aware of the situation. Pitt would have to make the decision about whether to involve the Special Branch, and to what extent, later, when he had more information. It was the type of decision Narraway had referred to: a gray area, fraught with moral difficulties.<br><br>Pitt bent back to the papers he had been reading.<br><br>There was a reception that evening. A hundred or so people of social and political importance would be gathered, ostensibly to hear the latest violin prodigy playing a selection of chamber pieces. In truth it would be a roomful of people attempting to observe and manipulate any shifts in political power, and to subtly exchange information that could not be passed in the more rigid settings of an office.<br><br>Pitt walked through the front door of his house in Keppel Street just after seven o&#x2019;clock, with plenty of time to get ready for the reception. He found himself smiling at the immediate warmth, a relief after the bitter wind outside. The familiar smells of baked bread and clean cotton drifted from the kitchen at the far end of the passage. Charlotte would be upstairs dressing. She was not yet used to being back in the glamour and rivalry of the high society into which she had been born. She had found it shallow when she was younger, and then, after marrying Pitt, it had been out of her reach. Now he knew, although she had never once said so, that at times she had missed the color and wit of it all, however superficial it was.<br><br>Minnie Maude was in the kitchen preparing Welsh rarebit for him, in case the refreshments at the event were meager. Her hair was flying out of its pins as usual, her face flushed with exertion, and perhaps a certain excitement. She swung around from the big stove as soon as she heard his footsteps.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Mr. Pitt, sir, &#x2019;ave yer seen Mrs. Pitt? She looks a proper treat, she does. I never seen anyone look so?.?.?.&#x201d; She was lost for words, so instead held out the plate of hot savory cheese on toast. Then, realizing the need for haste, she put it on the kitchen table, and fetched him a knife and fork. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get yer a nice cup o&#x2019; tea,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;Kettle&#x2019;s boiled.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said, hiding at least part of his amusement. Minnie Maude Mudway had replaced Gracie Phipps, the maid who had been with the Pitts almost since they were married. He was still not entirely used to the change. But Gracie had her own home now, and he was happy for her. Minnie Maude had been hired on Gracie&#x2019;s recommendation, and it was working out very satisfactorily, even if he missed Gracie&#x2019;s forthright comments about his cases, and her loyal and highly independent support.<br><br>He ate in silence, with considerable appreciation. Minnie Maude was rapidly becoming a good cook. With a more generous budget at her disposal than Gracie had ever had, she had taken to experimenting&#x2014;on the whole, with great success.<br><br>He noticed that she had made enough for herself, although her portion was much smaller. However, she seemed unwilling to eat it in front of him.<br><br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t wait,&#x201d; he said, gesturing toward the saucepan on the stove. &#x201c;Have it while it&#x2019;s hot.&#x201d;<br><br>She gave an uncertain smile and seemed about to argue, then changed her mind and served it. Almost at once she was distracted by a stack of clean dishes waiting to be put away in the Welsh dresser, and her meal went untouched. Pitt decided he should speak to Charlotte about it; perhaps she could say something to make Minnie Maude feel more comfortable. It was absurd for her to feel that she could not eat at the kitchen table just because he was there. Now that she had taken Gracie&#x2019;s place, this was her home.<br><br>When he had finished his tea he thanked her and went upstairs to wash, shave, and change.<br><br>In the bedroom he found Jemima as well as Charlotte. The girl was regarding her mother with careful appreciation. Pitt was startled to see that Jemima had her long hair up in pins, as if she were grown-up. He felt proud, and at the same time, felt a pang of loss.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s wonderful, Mama, but you are still a little pale,&#x201d; Jemima said candidly, reaching forward to straighten the burgundy-colored silk of Charlotte&#x2019;s gown. Then she flashed Pitt a smile. &#x201c;Hello, Papa. You&#x2019;re just in time to be fashionably late. You must do it. It&#x2019;s the thing, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I do know,&#x201d; he agreed, then turned to look at Charlotte. Minnie Maude was right, of course, but it still caught him by surprise sometimes, how lovely Charlotte was. It was more than the excitement in her face, or the warmth in her eyes. Maturity became her. She had an assurance now, at almost forty, that she had not had when she was younger. It gave her a grace that was deeper than the mere charm that good coloring or straight features offered.<br><br>&#x201c;Your clothes are laid out for you,&#x201d; Charlotte said, in answer to his glance. &#x201c;Fashionably late is one thing; looking as if you mistook the arrangements, or got lost, is another.&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled, and did not bother to answer. He understood her nervousness. He was trying to counter his own anxiety over suddenly being in a social position that he had not been born into. His new situation was quite different in nature from being a senior policeman. Now he was the head of Special Branch and, except in the most major of cases, entirely his own master. There was no one with whom to share the power, knowledge, or responsibility.<br><br>Pitt was even more aware of the change in his circumstances as he alighted from the hansom and held out his arm for Charlotte, steadying her for an instant as she stepped down. The night air was bitterly cold, stinging their faces. Ice gleamed on the road, and he was careful not to slip as he guided Charlotte over to the pavement.<br><br>A coach with four horses pulled up a little ahead of them, a coat of arms painted on the door. The horses&#x2019; breath was visible, and the brass on their harnesses winked in the light as they shifted their weight. A liveried footman stepped down off the box to open the door.<br><br>Another coach passed by, the sound of iron-shod hoofs sharp on the stones.<br><br>Charlotte gripped his arm tightly, though it was not in fear that she might slip. She wanted only a bit of reassurance, a moment to gather her strength before they ventured in. He smiled in the dark and reached over with his other hand to touch hers for an instant.<br><br>The large front doors opened before them. A servant took Pitt&#x2019;s card and conducted them to the main hall, where the reception had already begun.<br><br>The room was magnificent. Scattered columns and pilasters stretching up to the painted ceiling gave it an illusion of even greater height. It was lit by four massive, dazzling chandeliers hanging on chains that seemed to be solid gold, though of course they weren&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure we&#x2019;re in the right place?&#x201d; Pitt whispered to Charlotte.<br><br>She turned to him with a wide-eyed look of alarm, then saw that he was deliberately teasing her. He was nervous. But he was also proud that this time she was here because he was invited, rather than because her sister, Emily, or her aunt, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould, had been. It was a small thing to give her, after all the years of humble living, but it pleased him.<br><br>Charlotte smiled and held her head a little higher before sailing down the small flight of steps to join the crowd. Within moments they were surrounded by a swirl of color and voices, muted laughter, and the clink of glasses.<br><br>The conversation was polite and most of it meaningless, simply a way for everyone to take stock of one another while not seeming to do so. Charlotte appeared perfectly at ease as they spoke to one group, then another. Pitt watched her with admiration as she smiled at everyone, affected interest, passed subtle compliments. There was an art to it that he was not yet ready to emulate. He was afraid he would end up looking as if he were trying too hard to copy those born into this social station, and they would never forget such a slip.</p><h2>The Virginal Conception and Bodily Resurrection of Jesus</h2><p>A noted Catholic scholar offers biblical evidence that challenges the historicity of the Church&#39;s most cherished beliefs</p><p></p><h2>Mighty Thor 4: The War Thor</h2><p>Who is the new Ultimate Thor?

But complicating Data&#x2019;s new life is an unexpected nemesis from years ago on the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i>&#x2014;the holographic master criminal Professor James Moriarty. Long believed to be imprisoned in a memory solid, Moriarty has created a siphon into the "real" world as a being of light and thought. Moriarity wants the solid form that he was once told he could never have, and seeks to manipulate Data into finding another android body for him to permanently inhabit...even if it means evicting the current owner, and even if that is Data himself.<br> <br>&#x2122;, ï¿½, &amp; ï¿½ 2013 CBS Studios, Inc.

He bent low to inspect the surface, like a billiard player lining up a shot, checking for dings or other small imperfections in the play surface. Some of the other cooks had the bad habit of smacking the flat-top with the edge of a spatula. He had been trying to dissuade them with both gentle reminders and terse threats, but he worked only the breakfast shift and couldn&#x2019;t control what happened the rest of the day.<br> <br>Still, he always liked to make sure the cooktop was clean and lubricated before he headed out the door. The diner owner, a Cardassian expat name Oban, didn&#x2019;t mind paying him for the extra few minutes on his timecard, especially since the short-order cook was the main reason the business had been turning a profit for the past few weeks.<br> <br>Before his arrival, the diner&#x2019;s sole virtue resided in the fact that patrons knew they could sit at the counter and nurse a cup of tepid coffee or raktajino for as long as they liked without being rousted out, mostly because no one else wanted their seat. Now, thanks to the new morning cook, there was a line out the door most days, and the patrons weren&#x2019;t only locals looking for a quick bite before heading to work. Word had spread through the food-lovers underground: Many of the patrons were tourists, eager to spend credits on eggs and bacon, waffles, and a strange delicacy called &#x201c;chipped beef on toast.&#x201d; Diners had started posting reviews on culinary sites, but only for breakfast. Sure, there was some spillover to the other shifts, but all the chatter was about breakfast, breakfast, breakfast and the wonder of this one cook who could crank out delicacies at a clockwork pace. In a world full of replicated fare, simple food made well was a draw, even if the customers had to find their way to a seedy little grease-stained pit in the middle of nowhere.<br> <br>The short-order cook knew all about the buzz, but he never mentioned it. Oban paid him a decent wage, and the Cardassian was smart enough not to ask too many questions. Their conversations were limited to simple questions like, &#x201c;You almost done there, Davey?&#x201d;<br> <br>The short-order cook didn&#x2019;t respond. He was too absorbed with the process of re-lubricating the cooking surface.<br> <br>&#x201c;Davey?&#x201d;<br> <br>The short-order cook looked up. Oban was standing in the narrow doorway that led to the prep kitchen and, past that, to Oban&#x2019;s tiny office.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; the short-order cook said. &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t listening. You want something?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Oban said. &#x201c;Come on back to the office when you&#x2019;re done. Got something I need to ask ya.&#x201d;<br> <br>The short-order cook sighed. &#x201c;Sure. Yeah. Be there in a minute.&#x201d; He finished wiping down his workstation and collected his tools so he could drop them off in the dish room before leaving. Just before he left the kitchen, he pointed at the second grill station, the one where the lunch cook, an Orion native named Settu, was working. &#x201c;Flip those eggs. They&#x2019;re about to overcook.&#x201d;<br> <br>Settu pouted. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re fine. Barely been on the grill for two minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;ve got the temp too high. They&#x2019;re going to go rock solid in 30 seconds.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can you tell?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can smell &#x2019;em.&#x201d;<br> <br>Settu waved him off. &#x201c;Go punch out. Your shift is over.&#x201d;<br> <br>The short-order cook sighed again and turned to leave. &#x201c;Fine. Whatever. Kelly isn&#x2019;t going to like it when you cost her a tip.&#x201d; Settu had a crush on Kelly.<br> <br>Behind him, the short-order cook heard the spatula being slipped under the eggs and turned. Then, a moment later, the soft click of the heat controls being adjusted. The short-order cook smiled, but only a little.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>&#x201c;What can I do for you, boss?&#x201d; the short-order cook asked, standing in the office door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sit down a minute, Davey.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have time to sit down. I have to get home. I like to see my kid before she heads off to school.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; Oban said, rubbing the stubble on his chin. The Cardassian always looked like he was a day or two away from his last shave. &#x201c;I remember those days. Being a parent, it can be hard. Especially if you&#x2019;re doing it all by yourself, am I right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you say so.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re not doing it all by yourself?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that,&#x201d; the short-order cook said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t say much about yourself at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>The short-order cook untied his apron and wadded it up into a ball. Outside the door, there was a bin where kitchen staff threw dirty clothes and towels at the end of their shifts. He tossed the apron into the bin. Freed from the restrictions of the apron, his belly dropped down a bit over the top of his belt. &#x201c;Do you have something you want to ask me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just wanted to let you know I looked into the whole chicken egg thing for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I found a place that has live Terran chickens. They sell them for the meat, but the owner says, yeah, they lay eggs, too, and he&#x2019;s willing to sell them to me if I want. But, he says, most Orion folk have an allergic reaction to chicken eggs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then we won&#x2019;t feed &#x2019;em to Orions. We&#x2019;ll tell the waitstaff not to let Orions order them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are these chicken eggs such a big deal?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get them for me and I&#x2019;ll show you. I&#x2019;ll make you an omelet. These eggs you get&#x2014;what are they again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The birds are called paradins.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, whatever. The protein-to-water ratio is all wrong. Chicken eggs are perfect for omelets. We start making omelets and you&#x2019;ll start getting Terran customers. They&#x2019;ll go nuts. You can charge whatever you want and they&#x2019;ll pay it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And how do you know this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I used to work with Terrans. Back in the day.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Another restaurant?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. A restaurant. Nice place, but crazy hours. Couldn&#x2019;t stand the hours after I became a dad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can see that,&#x201d; Oban said. &#x201c;A father has to be there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;ll get the chicken eggs?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get the chicken eggs. And then you can make me an omelet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. You won&#x2019;t regret it. Anything else? I need to get going.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just one more thing,&#x201d; Oban said. He rubbed the back of his neck with one big, meaty hand. &#x201c;I wanted to let you know&#x2014;yesterday, these guys came by looking for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;?&#x2018;These guys&#x2019;?&#x201d; the short-order cook asked. &#x201c;What guys? I don&#x2019;t know any guys. What did they look like?&#x201d;<br> <br>Oban shrugged. &#x201c;I dunno. Just . . . guys.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Big? Small? Orion? Human?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nah, not Orion. Maybe human. Maybe not. You know I have trouble telling them apart. Just . . . guys.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two of them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cops? Feds?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think so. Leastways they didn&#x2019;t show me a badge or anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did they say what they wanted?&#x201d; The short-order cook tried to sound casual, but the hairs were standing up on the back of his neck.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really. Just . . . did you work here? How long? Did I know anything about your life outside work?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you said . . . ?&#x201d;<br> <br>Oban threw his hands up, imploring. &#x201c;Hey, c&#x2019;mon, Davey. Whataya think I said? Told &#x2019;em to get bent. This is Orion. We don&#x2019;t have to say nuthin&#x2019; about nobody if we don&#x2019;t want to. And you, you know, you&#x2019;re like . . . well, you ain&#x2019;t given me any trouble, so I don&#x2019;t make trouble for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The short-order cook felt the sense of alarm subside. Oban might not be telling the entire truth, but there was little chance that he had told the &#x201c;guys&#x201d; anything meaningful for the simple reason that there was so little he could have said. He had been careful, very careful, about not revealing anything important about himself. &#x201c;Well, okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thanks, Oban. Appreciate the word. They didn&#x2019;t leave names or comm info or anything like that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Naw, naw. They just slid out, all casual. Nobody saw where they went.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. Maybe it was someone I used to work with. Probably I owe them money.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure, Davey. I figured it was something like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; the short-order cook said. &#x201c;No doubt.&#x201d; He turned to leave, waving back over his shoulder. &#x201c;Well, let me know if these guys turn up again, okay? See you tomorrow, Oban. Thanks for looking into the eggs for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No problem, Davey. See you in the morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>On his way out of the kitchen, the short-order cook stopped at the time-clock station and waved his employee identification under the scanner so it could log his hours. Then, he walked through the still-crowded dining room, pausing only to wave at a couple of regular patrons and to exchange words with the servers he had become friendly with over the past month. Kelly, the server who Settu was crushing on, gave him a quick smile and a thumbs-up. Like him, she was a Terran, a student on sabbatical from her university. He suspected she was homesick for some interaction with a familiar face shape and skin color, but the short-order cook was already running late. He waved back and said, &#x201c;Have to run.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kelly acknowledged the wave and asked, &#x201c;See you tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. Tomorrow. If I&#x2019;m lucky, I&#x2019;ll be able to make you a treat.&#x201d;<br> <br>The short-order cook was lying. He felt bad about it, but he didn&#x2019;t see how he had much choice. He wouldn&#x2019;t be returning to Oban&#x2019;s. Walking out the wide double doors, he stopped briefly to look back at the building faï¿½ade, as if memorizing it. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said aloud, &#x201c;that was fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>Shrugging into his jacket, the short-order cook walked at a brisk pace up the street. The part about wanting to see his daughter was absolutely true, though he wasn&#x2019;t rushing because she was expected at school. In fact, it was entirely possible that his daughter was just returning home herself. She might have been out all night, which worried the short-order cook a bit, especially now that he knew someone had been looking for him, but she was a smart girl and wouldn&#x2019;t make any foolish choices.<br> <br>Mostly, though, he was rushing home to see her because that&#x2019;s what he did every day. It was their habit, their ritual: They would meet in the morning and sit in their small garden that faced the boulevard and exchange stories about what they had done over the course of the previous day. He would tell her about the conversation with Oban and his decision not to return to the diner. She would mock him and express her belief that he had become paranoid. No one, she would say, cared where he came from or what he did before deciding to try cooking breakfast for a living. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just another one of your little fascinations, Father. And you made that poor man find chicken eggs for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The short-order cook did feel bad about the eggs, but Oban would be able to keep his last paycheck as compensation. And, who knew? Maybe one of the other cooks would try to make an omelet.<br> <br>Anyone who would have considered watching the short-order cook as he walked down the busy street would have viewed a very peculiar scene; however, all Orions valued their privacy. Indeed, one of the reasons the short-order cook had decided to settle there was the Orion culture&#x2019;s fanatical desire to maintain control over their personal identities. The planet was one of the few technologically advanced planets in the sector where an individual could be sure he wasn&#x2019;t being passively observed by a multitude of recording devices, scanners, or sensors at any given moment.<br> <br>The short-order cook pulled back his shoulders and the slight bulge of his belly slowly disappeared and he became slightly taller. He rubbed his face and the skin around his neck and jowls tightened and grew paler. He ran his hand through his hair and instead of it getting shaggier or more rumpled, it grew straighter and thicker. The small bald spot on the crown of his head filled in. After walking for eight blocks and turning several corners, the short-order cook stopped in front of a small, well-maintained three-story house. The front yard was surrounded by a high wooden fence that was heavily hung with dark ivy and small purple blossoms. Between the slats of the fence, a passerby might be able to make out a small wooden table and three chairs.<br> <br>If Kelly, the waitress from Oban&#x2019;s diner, had walked past the short-order cook at that very moment, she might have passed by without a second glance. The short-order cook&#x2019;s appearance was entirely altered: taller, wider at the shoulder and slimmer at the waist. Another Terran would have considered him moderately attractive, though more striking than handsome in any conventional sense, with a wide brow, deep-set eyes, and a heavy jawline.<br> <br>An observer&#x2014;should anyone have the bad manners to stare&#x2014;would have said the man seemed overly serious, somber even, until he smiled, which he did at just that moment, as if remembering a happy memory. In fact, he was remembering his favorite time of day. He would walk in through the front door of his domicile and announce his presence. His daughter would appear from one of the inner rooms and find him in the hallway. They would embrace and she would begin to talk. Eventually, his daughter&#x2019;s caretaker would appear and then she would give her account of their day. The three of them would prepare a small meal (though none of them was really hungry) and they would carry it out to the garden (on fair days) or out onto the enclosed porch (on foul ones) and then they would talk and talk and talk.<br> <br>The thought of this moment, the anticipation, was almost as delicious as the reality. The man who had been the short-order cook smiled and walked up the three concrete steps to his front door. The sensor package recognized his biometric signature and admitted him when he depressed the door latch. He walked into the entrance hall and hung the light jacket on one of the hooks by the door. He noted that neither his daughter&#x2019;s coat, nor his daughter&#x2019;s caretaker&#x2019;s, was hanging on a hook, though this was hardly unusual. As often as not, they left their coats in their bedrooms or draped over the back of the couch in the family room. His daughter was not mindful or tidy the way he was, a trait that often frustrated him, but, if pressed, he would admit also delighted him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lal?&#x201d; he called, the same as he did every day. &#x201c;Are you home?&#x201d; The pitch of his voice had changed, too, since the conversation with Oban. The rough, scratchy edge had disappeared, replaced by a much more refined and measured tone. &#x201c;Are you in the kitchen?&#x201d; He stood and waited for the ritual to play out, trying not to fret or worry.<br> <br>He listened for the click of heels on the parquet hallway floor or the squeak of the kitchen door swinging open, but he heard nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lal?&#x201d; he repeated. &#x201c;Daughter?&#x201d; Perhaps she was playing a trick on him. Or was this a new game? Though she was an incredibly self-possessed and articulate individual, his daughter was still very young. But he considered: If this were a game, he would have expected to find some indication of what the rules were.<br> <br>&#x201c;Alice?&#x201d; he called, raising his voice. Could they be out in the garden? No, he would have seen them as he passed. One of them&#x2014;Lal or Alice&#x2014;would have greeted him.<br> <br>He walked through the entry hall into the living room, which was dimly lit, the curtains drawn. This was highly unusual. Lal enjoyed the morning light. Every day, she would pull back the drapes and ...</p><h2>Tempest (Valdemar Anthologies)</h2><p><b>Twenty-four authors ride with Mercedes Lackey to her magical land of Valdemar, adding their own unique voices to the Heralds, Bards, Healers, and other heroes of this beloved fantasy realm.</b><br><br>The Heralds of Valdemar are the kingdom&#x2019;s ancient order of protectors.

Master Bards, all suspected of the same treason Ferrin had committed: conspiracy against the throne. Malfeasant use of their Gifts. <br><br>Not in that list: &#x201c;Madra,&#x201d; the name Ferrin had given for the agent of &#x201c;Lord Dark,&#x201d; a mysterious figure who had encouraged his efforts to start an insurrection in Highjorune. Wil had no idea who either one was, though he highly doubted Lord Dark had been born with that name.<br><br>Wil hauled himself out of the comfiest chair in the Crown. Ystell, the new owner, wanted to rename it something more patriotic and less nostalgic. The Queen&#x2019;s Crown or the Hanged Bard, though the latter seemed a bit too grim for Wil.<br><br>He pulled on his boots to traverse the muddy grounds to the privy. Bard Amelie, who had assisted in the arrest of Ferrin, had left that morning as soon as the rain stopped, even though some roads were still impassable. She&#x2019;d gladly gamble if it got her out of Highjorune. He didn&#x2019;t blame her one bit. He&#x2019;d have gone with her&#x2014;<br><br><i>But . . .</i><br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t, because he had someone else to consider. Someone who couldn&#x2019;t be out in driving rain and flooding roads, seeing as she&#x2019;d yet to turn five years old.<br><br>Wil rode Circuit under very special circumstances: with his daughter, Ivy. The Companions had even volunteered one of their own to be her nanny.<br><br>Being cooped up indoors for a week while they&#x2019;d waited out the storms had been hardest on her.

The need for freedom in littles that age simply ran too deep.<br><br>Relieved and ready for bed, Wil tromped back through the empty kitchen, leaving his boots by the door. Tomorrow. Tomorrow they could leave. But tonight they enjoyed a warm bed, and the Companions a stable.<br><br><i>:Ahem. I am</i> not <i>in a stable. I am in the stockade courtyard outside the jail, watching four Guards drink from a wineskin and offering me not so much as a mushy apple.:<br><br></i>Wil chuckled as he climbed the stairs. <i>:You&#x2019;ll trade off with Aubryn in a couple of candlemarks, and then you&#x2019;ll get your comfy stall.

Aubryn cantered ahead into the three-walled courtyard and returned moments later with nothing. Wil&#x2019;s hands trembled, but a calm, rational part of him kept thinking. She&#x2019;d vanished, but where? Why? And how far could she have gotten?<br><br><i>:Nothing on the south side of town,:</i> Vehs said. <i>:Where are you?:</i><br><br><i>:The old castle,:</i> Aubryn said. <br><br>&#x201c;<i>Ivy!</i>&#x201d; Wil bellowed, though it seemed pointless. Like many small children, Ivy simply didn&#x2019;t respond to her name most times.<br><br><i>:I could try a Mindcall, but it would probably wake up anyone the least bit sensitive in town,:</i> Aubryn said.<br><br><i>:What about that song Amelie sings?:</i> Vehs asked, appearing down the road and racing toward them.<br><br><i>:Uh. What?:</i> Wil said.<br><br><i>:The one Ivy likes to finish, about Maiden&#x2019;s Hope flowers. She can&#x2019;t resist. &#x201c;Pure white blooms&#x2014;&#x201d;:</i><br><br>Wil gathered a deep breath and warbled:<br><br><i>&#x201c;Pure white blooms, perfume of hope!</i><br><i>I pray that you don&#x2019;t get eaten by&#x2014;&#x201d;</i><br><br>A distant voice piped out, &#x201c;The goats!&#x201d;<br><br>Wil sprinted toward it, down a small road off the Palace to an old stone building. He saw the little lantern first, then the figure beside it, crouched in the mud.<br><br>&#x201c;Ivy!&#x201d; he yelled, the Companions thundering behind him. She looked up, startled, then grinned.<br><br>&#x201c;Dada!&#x201d; she said, holding out a hand. &#x201c;I got snails!&#x201d;<br><br>Wil stared at her, torn between furious screaming and relieved sobbing. Ivy kept grinning as she got to her feet, oblivious to her muddy clothes and the chaos she&#x2019;d caused.<br><br>&#x201c;I got snails,&#x201d; she repeated, stuffing them into a jar.<br>&#x201c;Sleep in the loft?&#x201d; Ivy said as they arrived back at the stable.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I said,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Get up there. Take off your clothes. I&#x2019;ll go fetch fresh ones.&#x201d;<br><br>Vehs had gone back to his guard duty and Aubryn to her stall. Ivy looked dubiously at the loft ladder, then scrambled up it.<br><br>Wil leaned his forehead against a wooden post. He felt hollowed out. Parenting was hard.<br><br>&#x201c;Ivy, you can&#x2019;t do what you did tonight,&#x201d; he said, straightening and speaking into the darkness. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s dangerous.&#x201d;<br><br>She peeked over the edge of the loft&#x2019;s wooden platform.&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because dada&#x2019;s a Herald, and there are dangerous people who want to hurt you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Her shirt sailed out of the loft. He caught it midair.<br><br>&#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re my daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s dumb.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d bite them.&#x201d;<br><br>He rubbed his forehead. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you would.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hard.&#x201d; Her pants dropped from above, and he saw her peek out again and chomp at the air comically.<br><br>&#x201c;Ivy . . .&#x201d; He sighed, then smiled. &#x201c;Where did you put the snails?&#x201d;<br><br>She held up the jar.<br><br>&#x201c;Hand it down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dad-d-d-a-a-a&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br><br>She acquiesced, pouting.<br><br><i>:Keep an eye on her,:</i> he thought to Aubryn, leaving the jar on one of the stable&#x2019;s tack shelves before collecting the soiled garments.<br><br><i>:That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m here.:</i><br><br>He dug up fresh clothes from the saddlebags, left the dirty ones by the laundress&#x2019; door, and had just arrived back at the stable when he felt Vehs&#x2019;s alarm.<br><br><i>:What&#x2019;s wrong?:</i><br><br><i>:I don&#x2019;t know,:</i> the Companion said. <i>:All four of the guards are asleep, and the gaol door is open. I can&#x2019;t fit in there. I&#x2019;m going to find someone who can.:</i><br><br>Wil cursed and sprinted to the ladder, throwing the clothes up to his daughter. &#x201c;Aubryn, watch her,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Vehs needs me.&#x201d;<br><br>Ivy leaned out. &#x201c;Dada? Can I come?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>No</i>.&#x201d; She cringed at the severity of his tone. Feeling guilty, he climbed the ladder halfway and kissed her cheek. &#x201c;Stay here. <i>Do not</i> leave unless Aubryn says to. Okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she whispered.<br><br>Then he jumped down and ran out.<br>The narrow cell had served as a slaughter chute. One small quarrel had forever silenced Ferrin&#x2019;s testimony. <br><br>Wil stood in the entry, taking in the scene of blood and gore. He&#x2019;d gotten past the point of wanting to flip the nearest table and had slipped into a quiet mix of anger and sickness.<br><br><i>:This is my fault,:</i> Vehs said.<br><br>Wil walked back out into the courtyard without replying. The four sleeping Guards were all being roused by another, mixed expressions of confusion and shock on their faces. Wil scanned the area. Four stools for them to sit on. A few skins of the wine Vehs had observed. One sword on the flagstones. So one had drawn his weapon before&#x2014;what?<br><br><i>:Watch out for me,:</i> Wil said.<br><br><i>:Always.:</i><br><br>Wil leaned against a wall and pressed his hands into the stones.<br><br>As a Herald Trainee, Wil and his teachers had thought him a Foreseer; he had Visions, and a gut instinct that bordered on prescient. But a few years ago, his Gift had taken an odd turn&#x2014;it started showing him the <i>past</i> in addition to the future. It worked with objects, places&#x2014;sometimes people, too.<br><br>Now he skimmed the surface of the courtyard&#x2019;s last few candlemarks. And Saw&#x2014;<br><br> <i>&#x2014;Vehs and the Guards, Vehs departing through the sally port, and, not long after, a knock at the gate. Two of the Guards went to answer. A brief conversation, and then they unbarred and opened the gate.</i><br><br><i>A woman strode through, dressed in a black&#x2014;no, just a very, very dark green&#x2014;cloak with a deep hood. She had her hands on the arms of the Guards, who escorted her, meek as lambs. The other two stood in alarm and confusion; one began to draw his sword. She slid forward like a snake, darting between them, and her hands caressed their faces. Both Guards crumpled to the ground.</i><br><br><i>She stood a moment, slightly bent. Wil could hear her panting slightly. Then she straightened and faced the first two, still standing obediently nearby.</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;Where are the keys?&#x201d; she asked.</i><br><br><i>One unhooked a ring of keys from his belt and handed it to her. She brushed her hands on their cheeks, and they collapsed.</i><br><br><i>For a few moments, Wil saw her more clearly. Sweat sheened her face, and she breathed hard. She smiled.</i><br><br><i>&#x2014;I know her</i>, Wil realized with a shock.&#x2014; <br><br><i>Her visit inside the gaol only took a few minutes. She emerged again and left. Half a candlemark later, Vehs returned.&#x2014;</i><br><br>Wil released the moments, reorienting back into the now.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you all right, Herald?&#x201d;<br><br>Wil looked up at the Guard, the one who&#x2019;d been waking the others, digging to remember her name. Sergeant Bergen. She&#x2019;d been the first Guard Vehs had found. She had a stern, square face, close- cropped graying hair, and the lean frame of a career military woman.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking for a woman, about so high.&#x201d; He held his hand up to his shoulder. &#x201c;Dark green cloak, curly golden hair, pale skin.&#x201d;<br><br>The Guard&#x2019;s eyes lit up. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll start looking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how . . . but she seems to have some sort of . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He hesitated. He didn&#x2019;t want to say &#x201c;magic.&#x201d; Magic didn&#x2019;t happen in Valdemar . . . <i>Or that&#x2019;s what we all said before Hardorn summoned demons and Herald-Captain Kerowyn came along</i> . . .<br><br>Still. This could be a Gift. But the idea that one of the Gifted would carry this out . . . &#x201c;Some sort of . . . sway,&#x201d; he said at last. &#x201c;Maybe a drug or toxin. Just . . . be careful.&#x201d;<br><br>Bergen looked confused by this, but she saluted and went off to assemble a search detail. <br><br>Wil took a lantern and walked back into the gaol. He strode down the hallway and past the other empty cells. Two of Ferrin&#x2019;s accomplices had been here until a couple nights ago&#x2014;Wil had been able to determine they knew relatively little, and he passed sentence for the Guards to carry out. Probably a good thing, too. He had no doubt that if they&#x2019;d still been here, they would have received the same treatment as Ferrin.<br><br>Back in the dead Bard&#x2019;s cell, Wil held a handkerchief to his mouth. Then he set the lantern in the doorway and stepped into the cell. Doing his best not to touch the blood, he sat on Ferrin&#x2019;s cot.<br><br><i>:Okay, Vehs. One more time.:</i><br><br><i>:I&#x2019;m here.:</i><br><br>He took a lungful of fetid air and flung himself back across the candlemarks. The smell of blood vanished, and in his mind the cell appeared again, the same room with a completely different setting&#x2014; <br><br><i>&#x2014;Ferrin tossed and turned on his cot, sleep clearly eluding him.</i><br><br><i>This didn&#x2019;t go on for long. There came the heavy iron </i>chunk <i>of the hallway&#x2019;s bolt sliding back and the rattle of keys.</i><br><br><i>Ferrin sat up at the first sound and had stumbled to his feet by the second. He stood frozen in the patch of moonlight streaming in through the cell&#x2019;s lone, high window. Before the door opened, he&#x2019;d set his face in a practiced half-sneer.&#x2014;</i><br><br><i>&#x2014;</i>Expecting me,<i> Wil thought.&#x2014; </i><br><br><i>&#x2014;But a Herald wasn&#x2019;t who stepped inside. The sneer melted briefly into wide-eyed shock, then settled into a fixed smile.</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;Hello, Ferrin,&#x201d; she said.</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;M-Madra!&#x201d; The frozen smile stretched wide, and a lilt crept into his voice that Wil recognized as the Bard trying to exercise his Gift on her. &#x201c;Get me out of here!&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>Her smile curved higher as her hand moved within the depths of her cloak. &#x201c;Oh . . . definitely not.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>Something gleaming peeked out from the folds of the cloak. Machinery whirred, and a bolt burst through Ferrin&#x2019;s chest with alarming force for what must have been a small weapon. Viscera and blood splattered. The Bard grunted, surprise and alarm on his face as he stumbled backward.</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;Lord Dark sends regards,&#x201d; Madra said, shaking her cloak back into place before walking away. Limited by his current position, Wil could only watch her go.</i><br><br><i>Ferrin collapsed forward, gurgling.&#x2014; </i><br><br>Wil bore witness a little longer, then released the moments back to the past.<br><br>He sat there in the gloom, turning over this new information.<br><br>Madra.<br><br>She hadn&#x2019;t been Madra when he&#x2019;d last seen her. But names could change.<br><br><i>That smile</i> . . .<br><br>Wil didn&#x2019;t get up immediately. He sipped from his flask and let his nerves settle before hauling himself off the cot and back out to where Vehs waited.</p><h2>A Maiden&#39;s Grave</h2><p><b>A bus full of children is taken hostage in this &#x201c;screaming hit&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) from the bestselling author of <i>The Never Game</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Bone Collector</i>.</b><br><br>Along a windswept Kansas road, eight vulnerable girls and their helpless teachers are forced off a school bus and held hostage in an abandoned slaughterhouse.

The foot soldiers in these battles operate globally and inside the United States with orders from the White House to do whatever is necessary to hunt down, capture or kill individuals designated by the president as enemies.<br><br>Drawn from the ranks of the Navy SEALs, Delta Force, former Blackwater and other private security contractors, the CIA's Special Activities Division and the Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC), these elite soldiers operate worldwide, with thousands of secret commandos working in more than one hundred countries. Funded through black budgets,&#x201d; Special Operations Forces conduct missions in denied areas, engage in targeted killings, snatch and grab individuals and direct drone, AC-130 and cruise missile strikes. While the Bush administration deployed these ghost militias, President Barack Obama has expanded their operations and given them new scope and legitimacy.<br><br><i>Dirty Wars</i> follows the consequences of the declaration that the world is a battlefield,&#x201d; as Scahill uncovers the most important foreign policy story of our time. From Afghanistan to Yemen, Somalia and beyond, Scahill reports from the frontlines in this high-stakes investigation and explores the depths of America's global killing machine. He goes beneath the surface of these covert wars, conducted in the shadows, outside the range of the press, without effective congressional oversight or public debate. And, based on unprecedented access, Scahill tells the chilling story of an American citizen marked for assassination by his own government.<br><br>As US leaders draw the country deeper into conflicts across the globe, setting the world stage for enormous destabilization and blowback, Americans are not only at greater risk we are changing as a nation. Scahill unmasks the shadow warriors who prosecute these secret wars and puts a human face on the casualties of unaccountable violence that is now official policy: victims of night raids, secret prisons, cruise missile attacks and drone strikes, and whole classes of people branded as suspected militants.&#x201d; Through his brave reporting, Scahill exposes the true nature of the dirty wars the United States government struggles to keep hidden.<br></p><p>Jeremy Scahill is an investigative reporter, war correspondent, and author of the international bestsellers <i>Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army</i> and <i>Dirty Wars: The World is a Battlefield</i>.

I know of no other journalist who could have written it: For over a decade, Scahill has visited the war zones, overt and covert; interviewed the soldiers, spooks, jihadists, and victims; and seen with his own eyes the fruits of America's bipartisan war fever.

For the next 500 pages, Scahill demonstrates how what we don't know can hurt us - and hurt lots of other people we don't know."<br><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>"There is no journalist in America, in the world, who has reported on what the war on terror actually looks like under the Obama administration better than [Scahill]. This book is an unbelievable accomplishment. [W]hatever your politics, you should read this book. It is incredibly carefully reported. People who come to this book expecting a polemic, I think will be surprised to a find a book that really...lets the facts speak for themselves.

BRADDON&nbsp;Bella Rolleston had made up her mind that her only chance of earning her bread and helping her mother to an occasional crust was by going out into the great unknown world as companion to a lady. She was willing to go to any lady rich enough to pay her a salary and so eccentric as to wish for a hired companion. Five shillings told off reluctantly from one of those sovereigns which were so rare with the mother and daughter, and which melted away so quickly, five solid shillings, had been handed to a smartly-dressed lady in an office in Harbeck Street, London, W., in the hope that this very Superior Person would find a situation and a salary for Miss Rolleston.&nbsp;The Superior Person glanced at the two half-crowns as they lay on the table where Bella's hand had placed them, to make sure they were neither of them florins, before she wrote a description of Bella's qualifications and requirements in a formidable-looking ledger.&nbsp;"Age?" she asked, curtly.&nbsp;"Eighteen, last July."&nbsp;"Any accomplishments?"&nbsp;"No; I am not at all accomplished. If I were I should want to be a governess&#x2014;a companion seems the lowest stage."&nbsp;"We have some highly accomplished ladies on our books as companions, or chaperon companions."&nbsp;"Oh, I know!" babbled Bella, loquacious in her youthful candor. "But that is quite a different thing. Mother hasn't been able to afford a piano since I was twelve years old, so I'm afraid I've forgotten how to play. And I have had to help mother with her needlework, so there hasn't been much time to study."&nbsp;"Please don't waste time upon explaining what you can't do, but kindly tell me anything you can do," said the Superior Person, crushingly, with her pen poised between delicate fingers waiting to write. "Can you read aloud for two or three hours at a stretch? Are you active and handy, an early riser, a good walker, sweet tempered, and obliging?"&nbsp;"I can say yes to all those questions except about the sweetness. I think I have a pretty good temper, and I should be anxious to oblige anybody who paid for my services. I should want them to feel that I was really earning my salary."&nbsp;"The kind of ladies who come to me would not care for a talkative companion," said the Person, severely, having finished writing in her book. "My connection lies chiefly among the aristocracy, and in that class considerable deference is expected."&nbsp;"Oh, of course," said Bella, "but it's quite different when I'm talking to you. I want to tell you all about myself once and forever."&nbsp;"I am glad it is to be only once!" said the Person, with the edges of her lips.&nbsp;The Person was of uncertain age, tightly laced in a black silk gown. She had a powdery complexion and a handsome clump of somebody else's hair on the top of her head. It may be that Bella's girlish freshness and vivacity had an irritating effect upon nerves weakened by an eight-hour day in that overheated second floor in Harbeck Street. To Bella the official apartment, with its Brussels carpet, velvet curtains and velvet chairs, and French clock, ticking loud on the marble chimney-piece, suggested the luxury of a palace, as compared with another second floor in Walworth where Mrs. Rolleston and her daughter had managed to exist for the last six years.&nbsp;"Do you think you have anything on your books that would suit me?" faltered Bella, after a pause.&nbsp;"Oh, dear, no; I have nothing in view at pres- ent," answered the Person, who had swept Bella's half-crowns into a drawer, absent-mindedly, with the tips of her fingers. "You see, you are so very unformed&#x2014;so much too young to be companion to a lady of position. It is a pity you have not enough education for a nursery governess; that would be more in your line."&nbsp;"And do you think it will be very long before you can get me a situation?" asked Bella, doubtfully.&nbsp;"I really cannot say. Have you any particular reason for being so impatient&#x2014;not a love affair, I hope?"&nbsp;"A love affair!" cried Bella, with flaming cheeks. "What utter nonsense. I want a situation because mother is poor, and I hate being a burden to her. I want a salary that I can share with her."&nbsp;"There won't be much margin for sharing in the salary you are likely to get at your age&#x2014;and with your&#x2014;very&#x2014;unformed manners," said the Person, who found Bella's peony cheeks, bright eyes, and unbridled vivacity more and more oppressive.&nbsp;"Perhaps if you'd be kind enough to give me back the fee I could take it to an agency where the connection isn't quite so aristocratic," said Bella, who&#x2014;as she told her mother in her recital of the interview&#x2014;was determined not to be sat upon.&nbsp;"You will find no agency that can do more for you than mine," replied the Person, whose harpy fingers never relinquished coin. "You will have to wait for your opportunity. Yours is an exceptional case: but I will bear you in mind, and if anything suitable offers I will write to you. I cannot say more than that."&nbsp;The half-contemptuous bend of the stately head, weighted with borrowed hair, indicated the end of the interview. Bella went back to Walworth&#x2014;tramped sturdily every inch of the way in the September afternoon&#x2014;and "took off" the Superior Person for the amusement of her mother and the landlady, who lingered in the shabby little sitting-room after bringing in the tea-tray, to applaud Miss Rolleston's "taking off."&nbsp;"Dear, dear, what a mimic she is!" said the landlady. "You ought to have let her go on the stage, mum. She might have made her fortune as an actress."&nbsp;II&nbsp;Bella waited and hoped, and listened for the postman's knocks which brought such store of letters for the parlors and the first floor, and so few for that humble second floor, where mother and daughter sat sewing with hand and with wheel and treadle, for the greater part of the day. Mrs. Rolleston was a lady by birth and education; but it had been her bad fortune to marry a scoundrel; for the last half-dozen years she had been that worst of widows, a wife whose husband had deserted her. Happily, she was courageous, industrious, and a clever needlewoman; and she had been able just to earn a living for herself and her only child, by making mantles and cloaks for a West-end house. It was not a luxurious living. Cheap lodgings in a shabby street off the Walworth Road, scanty dinners, homely food, well-worn raiment, had been the portion of mother and daughter; but they loved each other so dearly, and Nature had made them both so light-hearted, that they had contrived somehow to be happy.&nbsp;But now this idea of going out into the world as companion to some fine lady had rooted itself into Bella's mind, and although she idolized her mother, and although the parting of mother and daughter must needs tear two loving hearts into shreds, the girl longed for enterprise and change and excitement, as the pages of old longed to be knights, and to start for the Holy Land to break a lance with the infidel.&nbsp;She grew tired of racing downstairs every time the postman knocked, only to be told "nothing for you, miss," by the smudgy-faced drudge who picked up the letters from the passage floor. "Nothing for you, miss," grinned the lodging-house drudge, till at last Bella took heart of grace and walked up to Harbeck Street, and asked the Superior Person how it was that no situation had been found for her.&nbsp;"You are too young," said the Person, "and you want a salary."&nbsp;"Of course I do," answered Bella. "Don't other people want salaries?"&nbsp;"Young ladies of your age generally want a comfortable home."&nbsp;"I don't," snapped Bella. "I want to help mother."&nbsp;"You can call again this day week," said the Person, "or, if I hear of anything in the meantime, I will write to you."&nbsp;No letter came from the Person, and in exactly a week Bella put on her nearest hat, the one that had been seldomest caught in the rain, and trudged off to Harbeck Street.&nbsp;It was a dull October afternoon, and there was a greyness in the air which might turn to fog before night. The Walworth Road shops gleamed brightly through that grey atmosphere, and though to a young lady reared in Mayfair or Belgravia such shop-windows would have been unworthy of a glance, they were a snare and temptation for Bella. There were so many things that she longed for, and would never be able to buy.&nbsp;Harbeck Street is apt to be empty at this dead season of the year, a long, long street, an endless perspective of eminently respectable houses. The Person's office was at the further end, and Bella looked down that long, grey vista almost despairingly, more tired than usual with the trudge from Walworth. As she looked, a carriage passed her, an old-fashioned, yellow chariot, on cee springs, drawn by a pair of high grey horses, with the stateliest of coachmen driving them, and a tall footman sitting by his side.&nbsp;"It looks like the fairy godmother's coach," thought Bella. "I shouldn't wonder if it began by being a pumpkin."&nbsp;It was a surprise when she reached the Person's door to find the yellow chariot standing before it, and the tall footman waiting near the doorstep. She was almost afraid to go in and meet the owner of that splendid carriage. She had caught only a glimpse of its occupant as the chariot rolled by, a plumed bonnet, a patch of ermine.&nbsp;The Person's smart page ushered her upstairs and knocked at the official door. "Miss Rolleston," he announced, apologetically, while Bella waited outside.&nbsp;"Show her in," said the Person, quickly; and then Bella heard her murmuring something in a low voice to her client.&nbsp;Bella went in fresh, blooming, a living image of youth and hope, and before she looked at the Person her gaze was riveted by the owner of the chariot.&nbsp;Never had she seen anyone as old as the old lady sitting by the Person's fire: a little old figure, wrapped from chin to feet in an ermine mantle; a withered, old face under a plumed bonnet&#x2014;a face so wasted by age that it seemed only a pair of eyes and a peaked chin. The nose was peaked, too, but between the sharply pointed chin and the great, shining eyes, the small, aquiline nose was hardly visible.&nbsp;"This is Miss Rolleston, Lady Ducayne."&nbsp;Claw-like fingers, flashing with jewels, lifted a double eyeglass to Lady Ducayne's shining black eyes, and through the glasses Bella saw those unnaturally bright eyes magnified to a gigantic size, and glaring at her awfully.&nbsp;"Miss Torpinter has told me all about you," said the old voice that belonged to the eyes. "Have you good health? Are you strong and active, able to eat well, sleep well, walk well, able to enjoy all that there is good in life?"&nbsp;"I have never known what it is to be ill, or idle," answered Bella.&nbsp;"Then I think you will do for me."&nbsp;"Of course, in the event of references being perfectly satisfactory," put in the Person.&nbsp;"I don't want references. The young woman looks frank and innocent. I'll take her on trust."&nbsp;"So like you, dear Lady Ducayne," murmured Miss Torpinter.&nbsp;"I want a strong young woman whose health will give me no trouble."&nbsp;"You have been so unfortunate in that respect," cooed the Person, whose voice and manner were subdued to a melting sweetness by the old woman's presence.&nbsp;"Yes, I've been rather unlucky," grunted Lady Ducayne.&nbsp;"But I am sure Miss Rolleston will not disappoint you, though certainly after your unpleas- ant experience with Miss Tomson, who looked the picture of health&#x2014;and Miss Blandy, who said she had never seen a doctor since she was vaccinated&#x2014;"&nbsp;"Lies, no doubt," muttered Lady Ducayne, and then turning to Bella, she asked, curtly, "You don't mind spending the winter in Italy, I suppose?"&nbsp;In Italy! The very word was magical. Bella's fair young face flushed crimson.&nbsp;"It has been the dream of my life to see Italy," she gasped.&nbsp;From Walworth to Italy! How far, how impossible such a journey had seemed to that romantic dreamer.&nbsp;"Well, your dream will be realized. Get yourself ready to leave Charing Cross by the train deluxe this day week at eleven. Be sure you are at the station a quarter before the hour. My people will look after you and your luggage."&nbsp;Lady Ducayne rose from her chair, assisted by her crutch-stick, and Miss Torpinter escorted her to the door.&nbsp;"And with regard to salary?" questioned the Person on the way.&nbsp;"Salary, oh, the same as usual&#x2014;and if the young woman wants a quarter's pay in advance you can write to me for a check," Lady Ducayne answered, carelessly.&nbsp;Miss Torpinter went all the way downstairs with her client, and waited to see her seated in the yellow chariot. When she came upstairs again she was slightly out of breath, and she had resumed that superior manner which Bella had found so crushing.&nbsp;"You may think yourself uncommonly lucky, Miss Rolleston," she said. "I have dozens of young ladies on my books whom I might have recommended for this situation&#x2014;but I remembered having told you to call this afternoon&#x2014;and I thought I would give you a chance. Old Lady Ducayne is one of the best people on my books. She gives her companion a hundred a year, and pays all the travelling expenses. You will live in the lap of luxury."&nbsp;"A hundred a year! How too lovely! Shall I have to dress very grandly? Does Lady Ducayne keep much company?"&nbsp;"At her age! No, she lives in seclusion&#x2014;in her own apartments&#x2014;her French maid, her footman, her medical attendant, her courier."&nbsp;"Why did those other companions leave her?" asked Bella.&nbsp;"Their health broke down!"&nbsp;"Poor things, and so they had to leave?"&nbsp;"Yes, they had to leave. I suppose you would like a quarter's salary in advance?"&nbsp;"Oh, yes, please. I shall have things to buy."&nbsp;"Very well, I will write for Lady Ducayne's check, and I will send you the balance&#x2014;after deducting my commission for the year."&nbsp;"To be sure, I had forgotten the commission."&nbsp;"You don't suppose I keep this office for pleasure."&nbsp;"Of course not," murmured Bella, remembering the five shillings entrance fee; but nobody could expect a hundred a year and a winter in Italy for five shillings.&nbsp;III&nbsp;From Miss Rolleston, at Cap Ferrino, to Mrs. Rolleston, in Beresford Street, Walworth, London.&nbsp;How I wish you could see this place, dearest; the blue sky, the olive woods, the orange and lemon orchards between the cliffs and the sea&#x2014;sheltering in the hollow of the great hills&#x2014;and with summer waves dancing up to the narrow ridge of pebbles and weeds which is the Italian idea of a beach! Oh, how I wish you could see it all, mother dear, and bask in this sunshine, that makes it so difficult to believe the date at the head of this paper. November! The air is like an English June&#x2014;the sun is so hot that I can't walk a few yards without an umbrella. And to think of you at Walworth while I am here! I could cry at the thought that perhaps you will never see this lovely coast, this wonderful sea, these summer flowers that bloom in winter. There is a hedge of pink geraniums under my window, mother&#x2014;a thick, rank hedge, as if the flowers grew wild&#x2014;and there are Dijon roses climbing over arches and palisades all along the terrace&#x2014;a rose garden full of bloom in November! Just picture it all! You could never imagine the luxury of this hotel. It is nearly new, and has been built and decorated regardless of expense.

The enormous mansion swirled and disappeared, leaving a small shack in its place. Hundreds of Artimï¿½ans who&#x2019;d been inside the mansion spilled out of the shack&#x2019;s doorway and burst through its windows, trying to keep from being crushed. The walls strained and bulged as if they were about to explode.<br> <br>Henry stared for an instant, trying to comprehend what was happening, and then he dropped the weeds and ran toward the chaos to help. As he went, he realized that his hospital ward and everything in it would have disappeared along with the mansion. He reached into his healer&#x2019;s coat pockets to see what medicines he carried with him, but those magical products had vanished too. His heart sank.<br> <br>Cries and shouts rose from all over the property. It was impossible to know where to start helping. Henry looked around frantically as it dawned on him that his and Thatcher&#x2019;s adopted young Unwanteds were probably somewhere in the disaster. His breath caught as he thought about how scared everyone must be. With Alex gone, he had to step up.<br> <br>With Alex gone. Not just away. Gone. For good.<br> <br>A sharp pain speared through Henry. He slowed and stumbled forward, crumpling into the agony of the realization. A horrendous sob exploded from him, the sound of it lost in the chaotic din. Alexander Stowe, head mage of Artimï¿½, is dead. Henry clutched his chest and tried to breathe, blinking the tears away. Then he got up and pushed through the growing crowd around the shack. He had to keep going.<br> <br>&#x201c;Henry! Over here!&#x201d; Sean Ranger was inside, holding his young son out the broken window and looking frantic. &#x201c;Can you take Lukas? I can&#x2019;t find Ava!&#x201d;<br> <br>Henry rushed up and took the boy. Sean used his sleeve to clear out the rest of the glass, then helped a few others get through the window. He disappeared into the shack to look for his daughter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; a man by the window said to Henry. &#x201c;Move out of the way so we can get more people out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Overwhelmed, Henry hurried away from the disaster with Lukas. The five-year-old was crying. He was missing a shoe, and he had a bruise turning purple on his arm and one on his cheek. A thin trickle of blood ran down his leg. Henry set the boy down and examined him. Finding his injuries to be minor, he tried soothing him. &#x201c;There,&#x201d; said Henry, distracted and looking anxiously for his teens to surface from the stampede. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be okay.&#x201d; With relief, Henry spotted one of his and Thatcher&#x2019;s recently adopted girls, Clementi Okafor, at another window helping others out. Her natural spiral curls had a layer of gray dust on them, and her black skin shone with sweat. Henry caught sight of Clementi&#x2019;s brother Ibrahim, from the same purge group of Unwanteds, assisting her from the inside. &#x201c;Thank goodness,&#x201d; Henry murmured. Hopefully the rest were close by.<br> <br>Lukas sniffled, drawing Henry&#x2019;s attention back. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Ava?&#x201d; asked the boy. &#x201c;I want my dad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s . . . She&#x2019;ll be coming any minute. Your dad is going after her. It&#x2019;s just a little shack, so it shouldn&#x2019;t be too hard. They&#x2019;ll find us out here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everybody fell on each other,&#x201d; said Lukas tearfully. &#x201c;I got hit in the face.&#x201d;<br> <br>Henry sucked in a breath, imagining what it must have been like to have the entire population of Artimï¿½, on multiple floors and in a variety of additional magical rooms that took up no space, suddenly and entirely converge in the single gray shack when the mansion disappeared. He kept seeing more and more people struggling to get out. With other Artimï¿½ans rushing forward to help at the exits, there wasn&#x2019;t much Henry could do at the moment but stare and feel the horror he&#x2019;d felt when he was ten years old&#x2014;the first time Artimï¿½ had disappeared and Alex had taken him under his wing.<br> <br>Alex is dead.<br> <br>The reminder hit him like a sucker punch to the gut. It repeated over and over in his thoughts. He tried to rationalize&#x2014;tried to come up with reasons why it couldn&#x2019;t be so. Maybe Alex had just gotten too far away from home and had moved outside of his magely range, assuming there was one. Silently Henry counted the days since Alex and Thatcher and the rest of the rescue team had left, and he knew Alex would have been in the land of the dragons for a while. So it didn&#x2019;t seem likely that he&#x2019;d somehow be out of range now if he hadn&#x2019;t been yesterday.<br> <br>Alex. Is dead.<br> <br>Sean came running over to them, bloodied and battered, with six-year-old Ava in his arms. She seemed to be okay, with just a few cuts and scratches on her arms and one of her legs. Henry checked her injuries and made sure she was all right. Then he looked up at Sean with dread, not sure what to say in front of the children.<br> <br>Sean held Henry&#x2019;s gaze for a moment, then shook his head sorrowfully. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s . . . gone. He&#x2019;s got to be.&#x201d;<br> <br>Henry swallowed hard. Hearing Sean say it made it seem real. Permanent. Sorrow enveloped him. But fear did too. If Alex was dead . . . what about Thatcher? And Lani? And Carina and the others on the rescue team? Were they dead too? He pushed the horror of that thought aside and nodded. &#x201c;We need to get to Aaron&#x2014;bring him over here right away. He knows the spell. He has an extra robe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Henry,&#x201d; said Sean, &#x201c;we can&#x2019;t get to him. The tubes are gone. We&#x2019;d have to take a ship. It&#x2019;ll take days.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we send a seek spell&#x2014;&#x201d; Henry cut himself off, annoyed and disheartened. &#x201c;Sorry. Of course not.&#x201d; He thought for a moment as his anxiety built. &#x201c;Who else knows what to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sean looked up. &#x201c;Claire Morning does. She has a robe. She&#x2019;s familiar with the spell, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is she in Artimï¿½?&#x201d; Henry&#x2019;s eyes swept the area.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she came today.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go to Quill and find her, then.&#x201d; Henry glanced back at the chaos surrounding the shack, confirming that, like Sean&#x2019;s and his kids&#x2019;, most people&#x2019;s wounds were superficial. His adopted Unwanteds would be all right&#x2014;they&#x2019;d been through worse. And there were people helping at all the exits. He spotted a few of the nurses assisting the injured, but without medicine or the hospital ward, they couldn&#x2019;t do much.<br> <br>Neither could Henry. &#x201c;Hang on a minute,&#x201d; he told Sean. He ran over to one of the nurses to explain where he was going and put her in charge while he was gone. &#x201c;Keep an eye out for the rest of my kids, will you?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Clementi and Ibrahim are there by the east window, but they&#x2019;re the only ones I&#x2019;ve seen emerge so far.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; said the nurse, knowing it was more important for Henry to go after Claire so they could get the magic back as quickly as possible. Before chaos turned to disaster.<br> <br>Sean and Henry each took a child on their backs and turned toward Quill, where Claire Morning now lived. At the sight of the larger part of the island, they both gasped, because they&#x2019;d forgotten something else.<br> <br>Quill was gone too. Everything there looked even worse than in Artimï¿½. It was nothing but old burned land and sooty rubble. And angry, nonmagical Quillens were coming toward them in droves.</p><h2>Shiloh: The Battle That Changed the Civil War</h2><p>The battle of Shiloh, fought in April 1862 in the wilderness of south central Tennessee, marked a savage turning point in the Civil War.<br><br>In this masterful book, Larry Daniel re-creates the drama and the horror of the battle and discusses in authoritative detail the political and military policies that led to Shiloh, the personalities of those who formulated and executed the battle plans, the fateful misjudgments made on both sides, and the heroism of the small-unit leaders and ordinary soldiers who manned the battlefield.</p><p><b>Larry J. Daniel</b> is the author of <i>Soldiering in the Army of Tennessee</i> and <i>Cannoneers in Gray.</i> He lives in Murray, Kentucky.<b><i>Chapter One</i></b><br><br><b>The Capitals<br><br><i>Richmond, Virginia</i></b><br><br>To all outward appearances, Southerners had reason to celebrate New Year's Day in 1862. During the previous eight months, the Confederacy had won most of the major land battles: Manassas; Wilson's Creek; Lexington, Missouri; Belmont; and Ball's Bluff. Confederate forces defiantly stood their ground from northern Virginia, through southern Kentucky, to the southwest comer of Missouri. The war had not yet turned vicious; Southern casualties totaled fewer than 5,000. Nor had the Richmond government felt the crushing weight of Northern industry and manpower. Hoped-for British intervention seemed closer than ever with the Federal seizure of two Confederate diplomats, James Mason and John Slidell, aboard the British steamer <i>Trent.</i> "King Cotton" diplomacy appeared to be working. More than 80 percent of England's cotton came from the American South, and the mills of England were already reduced to half-time. Although no official dialogue had occurred with Confederate commissioners, informal meetings had been conducted.<br><br>Bright sunshine and a springlike breeze warmed the streets of Richmond that New Year's Day. At 11 A.M., President Jefferson Davis hosted the first of what would become annual receptions at the Executive Mansion, the old three-story Brockenbrough house at East Clay and Twelfth Streets. The fifty-three-year-old president was frequently short-tempered, rarely compromising, and often impatient with disagreement. Although he had never fought in a duel, he had come dangerously close to it on no fewer than ten occasions. Davis's military as well as political background caused him to view himself as the emerging nation's war manager, a responsibility he probably could not have avoided even if he so desired. He was commonly seen as cold and aloof, and today proved no exception; several guests considered his cordiality forced and insincere. The wife of Colonel Joseph Davis, the president's nephew, stood in for the First Lady, Mrs. Varina Davis, who was indisposed. For four hours the chief executive, standing at the door of the main drawing room, greeted an uninterrupted line of visitors.<br><br>The sanguine veneer soon disintegrated. Even as Davis greeted guests that morning, information had reached the capital that the "Trent Affair" had been defused. The United States had offered a face-saving compromise that proved acceptable to the British. Confederate newspapers continued to carry articles for several days claiming that the British were preparing for war, but the peaceful resolution had dashed all immediate hope for intervention. This fact was not immediately evident to Davis and his Cabinet. John B. Jones, a perceptive clerk in the War Department, saw the situation clearly. He wrote in his diary that evening: "Now we must depend upon our own strong arms and stout hearts for defense."<br><br>Both the North and the South mistakenly believed that Great Britain desired to go to war with the United States. In truth, England had much more to lose in a war with the Union than she had to gain by diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy. The reason for the mill slowdown was not a cotton shortage (inventories were at an all-time high in December 1861), but, rather, that the market was already saturated with cloth. The British needed Northern grain far more than raw cotton, which could be purchased in Egypt and India. They were not going to risk their merchant shipping in a prolonged war that could not be won with the United States. For now, however, Davis continued to cling to the illusion of foreign intervention, a naivete that would have far-reaching implications for the Confederacy.<br><br>The administration had adopted a policy of territorial defense that called for protecting as much territory as possible. Troops were kept widely scattered rather than concentrated on a few strategic points. This policy was, to a degree, political appeasement, but it went deeper than that. The proverbial tail wagging the dog was foreign intervention. Davis considered it vital that the fledgling nation prove its viability by protecting its territory. To relinquish large chunks of land would send the wrong signal. Even after the flaws of the policy became blatantly apparent, Davis asserted that the gamble had been worth it.<br><br>Politicians, the Southern press, and the Davis administration had focused largely on the Virginia front. Popular sentiment dictated that it was there that the war would be won or lost. Ominous clouds soon began to loom, however, over the vast expanse west of the Appalachian Mountains known as the western theater.<br><br>A blast of arctic cold soon replaced the unseasonably mild temperatures. Snow blanketed the streets of Richmond on January 14 as Colonel St. John Liddell trudged to the door of the Executive Mansion. A black boy answered and showed him into a room where a lamp hung suspended over a center table. The setting offered Liddell a comfortable respite from his exhausting railroad journey from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Davis shortly entered the room. The two men had been formally introduced six months earlier, although Liddell vaguely remembered Davis from his childhood; they had lived in the same county in Mississippi, and their families were well associated. The colonel handed him a letter from General Albert Sidney Johnston.<br><br>Liddell's mission was an attempt by a frustrated Johnston to bypass the War Department and capitalize upon his long friendship with Davis. Their mutual admiration dated back to Transylvania College days in Lexington, Kentucky (Johnston was five years his senior), and to West Point. They subsequently fought Saux Indians together in the Northwest and Mexicans at Monterey. As secretary of war, Davis had appointed Johnston to the coveted position of commander of the 2nd United States Cavalry Regiment. Believing him to be the South's premier general, Davis wrote ecstatically when Johnston later tendered his services to the Confederacy: "I hoped and expected that I had others who would prove generals; but I knew I had one, and that was Sidney Johnston." Johnston's assignment in September 1861 to command the vast Department No. 2, which stretched from the Appalachians to the Ozarks, did not result from mere cronyism. Their prior association was probably not even necessary, the Johnston lobby being formidable. The general's appointment received support from a broad consensus.<br><br>The press coverage that preceded Johnston's odyssey from California would ultimately prove to his detriment; it produced exaggerated expectations on the part of both government officials and the populace. Historians' claims that he was overrated, though arguably true, have been influenced by subsequent events; the character flaws that marked his Civil War career were not apparent in the fall of 1861. The issue of whether he was the best selection for Department No. 2 must be seen in the context of "compared with whom." His prewar accomplishments exceeded those of Joseph E. Johnston, P. G. T. Beauregard, and Braxton Bragg.<br><br>Among his peers, only Robert E. Lee proved the exception. Although Lee graduated from West Point three years after Johnston and was subordinate to him in the 2nd Cavalry, he was offered top command of the United States Army at the beginning of the war, second only to Winfield Scott. When he declined, the position was offered to Johnston, who similarly refused. Davis subsequently made Lee commander of all the Confederate armies, where he functioned as a presidential chief-of-staff, while Johnston received the actual field command. How different the war might have been had the roles been reversed.<br><br>Friendship had not generated favoritism, however, and Johnston's frequent calls for additional troops even encountered occasional resistance. On September 30, 1861, Davis had labeled one of the general's early requests unwarranted. In December, Secretary of War Judah Benjamin insisted that Johnston had underestimated his Bowling Green force by one-half. Such looseness with the figures "made me very uneasy," Benjamin wrote, and the president was "equally at a loss to make out how matters stand." When Johnston attempted to raise troops himself, he was instructed by the War Department to cease.<br><br>Davis had not deserted his friend, however. After the early months of the war, few western regiments had been sent to Virginia, and some units en route to that state were diverted to Johnston. During the winter of 1861-62, the administration had even made a minimal effort to send troops from Virginia to the west. In December, Brigadier General John Floyd's brigade of Virginians was ordered to Bowling Green. The reinforcements proved insufficient.<br><br>During the fall and winter of 1861, Johnston watched nervously as Federal troop strength in the west far outpaced his forces. His impracticable four-hundred-mile line (east of the Mississippi River), with 57,500 troops, now faced twice that many Federals. Johnston's forces were concentrated in four key locations: 22,000 men under Major General Leonidas Polk at Columbus, Kentucky; 5,000 troops at the Tennessee and Cumberland River forts of Henry and Donelson; 24,500 troops at Bowling Green under Major General William J. Hardee; and 6,000 troops in eastern Kentucky commanded by Major General George Crittenden. Shortly after Liddell's departure from Richmond, Johnston had written Benjamin that he had 19,000 men (though his own reports revealed 4,000 more) to oppose a 75,000-man army under General Don Carlos Buell. The estimate of enemy troop strength was based upon a document stolen from Federal headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky. Indeed, an article had appeared in the <i>Richmond Examiner,</i> taken from the <i>New York Tribune,</i> that listed regiments and numbers in Kentucky.<br><br>Contrary to some modern assertions, Confederate administration officials fully understood Johnston's numerical weakness. Diarist John Jones noted this on January 23, 1862: "Again the Northern papers gave the most extravagant numbers to our army in Kentucky. Some estimates are as high as 150,000. I know, and Mr. Benjamin knows, that Gen. Johnston has not exceeded twenty-nine thousand effective men." Benjamin later conceded that the Bowling Green force had no more than twenty-four thousand effectives. What Davis may not have fully appreciated was the disproportionate numbers that Johnston faced. In a January 6 Cabinet meeting, the president had said that he did not accept the captured Louisville document, and that Buell's strength "could not exceed 45,000 effectives." He thought that the additional troops on the way to Bowling Green, although not giving Johnston parity, would close the numerical gap.<br><br>As Davis sat quietly reading Johnston's letter, his features grew pained, even angry. "My God," he erupted to Liddell. "Why did General Johnston send you to me for arms and reinforcements when he must know I have neither? He has plenty of men in Tennessee, and they must have arms of some kind." The brusque and opinionated Liddell, an unlikely emissary, retorted that the troops could come from the army at Manassas, Virginia, which was then not occupied. Davis insisted that Virginians were already angered about the loss of Floyd's brigade to Kentucky. Obstinately persisting, the colonel inquired whether troops could be spared from Charleston, Savannah, Pensacola, or even New Orleans. The president interrupted: "Do you think these places of so little importance that I should strip them of the troops necessary for their defense?" Liddell proved unrelenting, arguing that these locations were not as significant as the heartland of the Confederacy. Unless Johnston held his position, the Mississippi River would be lost and communications severed with the trans-Mississippi. "My God! Why repeat?" Davis again exclaimed, annoyed with Liddell's persistence. The colonel countered that he was simply attempting to make the facts of Kentucky and Tennessee known. The president quieted as Liddell explained Johnston desire that all available troops be concentrated in Kentucky and Virginia to take the offensive. Davis did not disagree, but he claimed that the time was not right. The conversation was cut short, but Davis invited the colonel to have dinner with him the next night.<br><br>The president's claim of inadequate troops was not true. There were armed units, but, in keeping with the administration policy of territorial defense, they were widely scattered. At the time of Liddell's visit, 25,000 Confederates (6,800 troops at Pensacola, 9,300 at Mobile, and 8,900 at New Orleans) sat idly on the Gulf Coast, not to mention 4,000 troops in eastern Florida. If Davis had taken advantage of interior lines and acted decisively at this moment (as he would three weeks later), events in the west might have taken a different turn. The subsequent chain of events must be viewed in the light of this mistaken administration policy.<br><br>The evening after his first confrontation with Davis, January 15, Liddell found the president more genial. He spoke of his earlier days and carefully avoided the subject of Johnston's dilemma. Liddell attempted to broach the issue, but the expression on the president's face made it apparent that he did not consider the subject appropriate table talk. Showing Liddell to the door at the conclusion of the evening, Dams said: "Tell my friend, General Johnston, that I can do nothing for him. He must rely upon his own resources." The colonel, rapidly coming down with a bronchial infection and a painful cough, found it cold on the streets of Richmond that night.<br><br>"We have heard bad news today from Kentucky." Thus began the January 23 diary entry of Thomas Bragg, Confederate attorney general. A dispatch had been received at the War Department via Johnston's headquarters at Bowling Green. Initial information was sketchy and came only from a Northern newspaper -- the <i>Louisville Democrat</i> of January 21. A Confederate division under Major General George Crittenden had been routed near Somerset, Kentucky, and Brigadier General Felix Zollicoffer was counted among the slain. Davis immediately canceled his Cabinet meeting for the day. "The President and Sec'y of War keep military matters to themselves -- they have been in conference today. I hope they have been able to devise some means to repair the disaster in Kentucky," Bragg concluded.<br><br>A second dispatch arrived at the War Department that evening from Johnston's headquarters. A Crittenden staff officer confirmed the repulse of the division "by superior numbers." The Southerners lost five hundred men, including all of their baggage and artillery, and the division was "in full retreat" southwest toward Nashville.<br><br>A stunned populace read the story the next day in the Richmond press. Although there had been other Confederate reversals earlier in the war, at Rich Mountain in western Virginia and at Port Royal, South Carolina, the eastern-Kentucky loss was serious and had far-reaching implications. Johnston's right flank was now uncovered, exposing Cumberland Gap and the east-west rail link connecting Richmond, Virginia, and Memphis, Tennessee. Several poorly armed and widely scattered Confederate regiments protected Cumberland Gap, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, but for all intents and purposes, eastern Tennessee, already crawling with Union partisans, was open to invasion. Indeed, an unconfirmed report (false, as it turned out) stated that 22,000 Federals were advancing on Cumberland Gap against a Southern garrison of 1,500. The road to Nashville also lay exposed to the east.<br><br>Johnston clearly understood his difficulty and proposed plugging the breach around Burkesville, Kentucky, about a hundred miles from Nashville. Crittenden's troops would be of no assi...</p><h2>The Calling: A Life Rocked by Mountains</h2><p>With heart-pounding descriptions of avalanches and treacherous ascents, Barry Blanchard chronicles his transformation from a poor Native American/white kid from the wrong side of the tracks to one of the most respected alpinists in the world.

It charged over the step of dirty brown ice above us like a breaking wave of black water, then it was airborne until it hammered back down into the gulley, driving into us like the fist of god. I screamed. The avalanche slapped my crampons out from under me, and I was folded in half. I believed I was going to die. The animal in me fought to force my hand into the torrent, to grab something solid. My crampons raked over the ice as I stumbled, thrusting my knees into the pressure of the onslaught, trying to get my feet under me. I shouted and I thrashed and the surging snow pushed my arms down at the same time that it swept my feet out to flap like rope anchored logs in a strong current. My anchor leash was as tight as cable; it hummed with the resonance of a standing wave and that frequency was transmitted into my bowels along the waist-belt of my harness. My senses where overcome, I didn&#x2019;t know which way was up. I was terrified. The avalanche surged onto any surface that opposed it and I felt the power and the weight of it. It felt like hundreds of tons of sand pouring through the hourglass of the mountain, piling onto us, burying us. Desperate and profane objections were torn from my lips, then muffled and swept off down the mountain. I thought that I would never see my wife again. I knew that I could lose love and life here. I started to plead, to pray, No. Please, no.&#x201d;<br>The avalanche, and the weight of it, began to pulsate. My right hand found my locking carabiner. My fingers wrapped into it and the muscles of my hand bulged into a firm hard fist. My left crampon scratched into the ice. I slammed its metal spikes in four times and forced myself upright into the flow. I sensed Ward to my left, had felt the knocking of his body against me and heard the rip of his screams like the tearing of air from an open window when trains pass. I looked up and saw the hazy warmth of his yellow jacket like the flash of a fast moving hull from deep underwater. There was no air. Because I&#x2019;d leveled my face to the avalanche&#x2019;s flow, an ice cold seal of moving snow pressed over my face until I panicked and thrust my head down to create a channel in which to breath.<br>The avalanche continued, for minutes, and the rushing snow drummed like a waterfall onto the taut fabric of my hood, stretched tight over my helmet. There were surges and with each surge I quivered and prayed that there would be no chunks of solidly bonded snow. I knew the impact of any firm mass would snap the single 9/16-inch loop of webbing that the three of us were anchored to. I did not want to die. I wanted my life. Ward was still beside me, and left of him I assumed, and prayed, was Kevin. Marc had been on rappel, last man down, when the avalanche hit. I did not know about Marc. Please, please let Marc be alive, please.&#x201d;<br>The pressure was so cold. Millions of ice fragments the snow- poured over my head and neck and back, each one stealing a small measure of my body heat. After fifteen minutes I was trembling from hypothermia. The avalanche continued. At twenty minutes my mind allowed the macabre irony of dying from the cold, instead of the physical violence of the avalanche, to enter. The avalanche had become an opponent by then, an enemy. I hated it, swore into it, challenged it. ALRIGHT YOU FUCKER. GIVE US A BREAK YOU FUCK! ENOUGH ALREADY YOU ROTTEN COCKSUCKER!&#x201d; The raging snow carried my curses into the vortex that it had created: a 35 centimeter long funnel below my down-turned face. I shook violently, my body jack hammering to produce heat. Then the avalanche hissed away down the polished glare of the ice like the retreating edge of an ocean wave over wet sand. Snowfall turbined around us and the air felt like cold metal on my teeth. The atmosphere quivered and I could hear the tension of the thunderstorm&#x2019;s electrical charge white noise crackling in my ears. The midday sky was as dark as dusk. I scraped hard-packed snow from the face of the watch that was threaded through my harness. It was 3:47 pm, July 13th, 1988. The avalanche had ended twenty-seven minutes after it had begun.<br>Ward&#x2019;s face looked old. Deep lines dragged down the corners of his mouth; I had never seen those lines in his face before. His eyes had the improperly focused look of shock, with too much black in his pupils. Streams of snot and compacted snow ran from his nose and snow had been rammed into his collar and hood because he hadn&#x2019;t had the wherewithal to lower his face from the flow, to protect himself. He was sick from the altitude cerebral edema. The swelling inside his head was killing him.<br> I was just going to unclip and get it over with.&#x201d; he said in a flat emotionless tone.<br> Where&#x2019;s Marc?&#x201d; I gasped, my jaw in spasm.<br> I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d; I saw him left of Kevin and I sighed, Thank God.&#x201d;<br>Between us Kevin began shaking the snow off like a wet angry dog.<br> ALRIGHT, THAT&#x2019;S ENOUGH OF THIS FUCKING SHIT!&#x201d; he snarled, looking very much like he intended to slug someone, We are getting the FUCK OUT OF THIS FUCKED UP PLACE!&#x201d;<br>Comically, half-meter high dunce caps of snow had accumulated on our heads and shoulders. Marc reached across and pushed mine off.<br> We have to get the hell out of here, &#x201d; he said.<br>I saw fear, and resolve, in his eyes. The four of us stood anchored to one tubular drive-in ice screw. It was hitched with a purple bar-tacked sling the width of my ring finger, which, if it were loaded with one thousand pounds, would sever. When the four of us had snapped tight to it we must have hit it with over eight hundred pounds. We stood at 25,300 feet on the Rupal Face of Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest mountain in the world, we were 1300 feet below the summit and we had nearly fourteen thousand feet of the face to descend. I twisted in another screw.<br></p><h2>The Principia (Great Minds Series)</h2><p>Sir Isaac Newton&#39;s Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles) is considered to be among the finest scientific works ever published. His grand unifying idea of gravitation, with effects extending throughout the solar system, explains by one principle such diverse phenomena as the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and the irregularities of the moon&#39;s motion.Newton&#39;s brilliant and revolutionary contributions to science explained the workings of a large part of inanimate nature mathematically and suggested that the remainder might be understood in a similar fashion. By taking known facts, forming a theory that explained them in mathematical terms, deducing consequences from the theory, and comparing the results with observed and experimental facts, Newton united, for the first time, the explication of physical phenomena with the means of prediction. By beginning with the physical axioms of the laws of motion and gravitation, he converted physics from a mere science of explanation into a general mathematical system.</p><p><b>ISAAC NEWTON</b> was born in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, Engï¿½land, on December 25, 1642. His father having died before his birth and his mother having remarried, Newton was sent to live with his maternal grandmother in the neighboring town of Grantham, where he attended school. An inattentive student, Newton nonetheless showed a great aptitude for making mechaniï¿½cal contrivances such as windmills and water clocks. While at school, Newton boarded with an apothecary, who may have imparted to the youngster a lifelong love of chemical experiments.<br><br>In 1656, following the death of her second husband, Newton's mother removed him from school and brought him back to Woolsthorpe with the idea of making her son a farmer. Newton's teacher at Grantham, recognizing the boy's talents, prevailed upon her to allow Newton to prepare for entrance to Cambridge University. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1661, under the tutelage of Isaac Barrow, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, and took his degree four years later.<br><br>Between 1665 and 1667, Newton made great strides in his method of "fluxions" (an early form of differential calculus) and began work on gravitation. It was also at this time that Newton inaugurated his studies on the nature of light: he demonstrated that differences in color resulted from differences in refrangibility, i.e., the ability of a ray of light to bend when passed through a refracting medium. In 1667, Newton returned to Cambridge from Woolsthorpe (where he had gone to escape the plague); two years later he succeeded Barrow as Lucasian Professor. In 1672 Newton was elected to the Royal Society.<br><br>Newton's great work, <i>Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica, </i>or <i>The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosoï¿½phy </i>(1687), grew out of his ongoing investigations into gravitation and planetary motion. Written over a period of only eighteen months, this book was immediately hailed as a masterpiece: it&nbsp;demonstrated how the law of gravitation could explain diverse phenomena, ranging from the tides to the irregularities of the moon's motion, and made possible a mathematical principle, unrealized up to that time, of the workings of a dynamic universe. Although Newton's system needed to be revised in the twentieth century in view of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, it remains valid for systems of ordinary dimensions, involving velocities that do not approach the speed of light.<br><br>Newton's contributions to science brought him fame and financial security: in addition to his professorship at Cambridge, Newton served for two years as a member of the Convention Parliament following the overthrow of King James II during the "Glorious Revolution" of 1688. In 1696 Newton was apï¿½pointed warden, and later master, of the mint, a lucrative position he held until his death. In 1704 he was made president of the Royal Society, and in 1705 he received a knighthood from Queen Anne. While a member of Parliament, Newton came into contact with such luminaries as the philosopher John Locke and the diarist Samuel Pepys.<br><br>Newton's life was not without bitterness, however: a proï¿½tracted controversy raged over whether Newton or Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz had been first in the invention of calculus, which strained scientific relations between England and the Continent. And, despite the <i>Principia's </i>enthusiastic reception, Newton's system would not be fully accepted among scientists and in university teaching until after his death.<br><br>Following his retirement from Cambridge in 1701, Newton prepared revised editions of the <i>Principia </i>(1713, 1726) and pubï¿½lished his second great treatise, the <i>Opticks, </i>in 1704. He died in Kensington, England, on March 20, 1727.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Dream Chaser (A Dream-Hunter Novel, Book 3)</h2><p><b>From #1 <i>New York Times</i> Bestselling Author Sherrilyn Kenyon </b><br><br>The spellbinding Dream-Hunter series continues!<br><br><b>Hades doesn&#x2019;t often give second chances...</b><br><br>Xypher has one month on Earth to redeem himself through one good deed or be condemned to eternal torture in Tarturus.

This in-depth study explores the origins of the etched print, its evolution from decorative technique to fine art, and its spread across Europe in the early Renaissance, leading to the professionalization of the field in the Netherlands in the 1550s. Beautifully illustrated, this book features the work of familiar Renaissance artists, including Albrecht Dï¿½rer, Jan Gossart, Pieter Breughel the Elder, and Parmigianino, as well as lesser known practitioners, such as Daniel Hopfer and Lucas van Leyden, whose pioneering work paved the way for later printmakers like Rembrandt and Goya. The book also includes a clear and fascinating description of the etching process, as well as an investigation of how the medium allowed artists to create highly detailed prints that were more durable than engravings and more delicate than woodblocks.</p><p>Featuring well-known works of art as well as lesser-known treasures, this is the first book to study the origins of the etched print through the late 15th and into the 16th century.<b>Catherine Jenkins</b> is an independent scholar.&nbsp;<b>Nadine Orenstein</b> is Drue Heinz Curator in Charge, and&nbsp;<b>Freyda Spira</b> is associate curator, both in the Department of Drawings and Prints at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><h2>1,411 Quite Interesting Facts to Knock You Sideways</h2><p><p><strong>A dazzling third installment of astounding new facts from the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling authors of <em>1,227 Quite Interesting Facts to Blow Your Socks Off</em> and <em>1,339 Quite Interesting Facts to Make Your Jaw Drop</em>.</strong></p><p><em>1,411 Quite Interesting Facts to Knock You Sideways</em> is a gold mine of wide-ranging, eye-opening, brain-bursting nuggets of trivia that's impossible to put down, another "treasure trove of factoids" (National Public Radio, <em>Weekend Edition</em>).</p><p>Did you know?</p><ul><li>Orchids can get jet lag</li><li>Lizards can't walk and breathe at the same time</li><li>Frank Sinatra took a shower 12 times a day</li><li>Ladybug orgasms last for 30 minutes</li><li>There are 177,147 ways to tie a tie</li><li>Traffic lights existed before cars</li><li>The soil in your garden is 2 million years old</li></ul> ---</p><p><p><strong>John Lloyd</strong> is the creator of the BBC quiz panel show <em>QI</em> (Quite Interesting).

Light came through in a vague haze, sifted just beyond the glass by the leaves of the oaks from the street. A large man, my uncle, came around the desk towards me. <br><br>I, smiling, nodding, trying to look agreeable. My uncle fatter than he had been. But happy. Fat and happy. That&#x2019;s the way. An important man in the governing of the city, my uncle had always been far too busy to bother with such as me. <br><br>&#x2014;My boy, you seem well. Not too long, coming down here on the train? There was an accident just yesterday. Someone got pushed. <br><br>The way he said it made it sound like the city was a sort of theatrical production. <br><br>&#x2014;Not long, I said quietly. I had my book. <br><br>I held up a book. It was a book of letters that desperate Russian poets had sent to an old German poet and he to them during a summer near the beginning of the century. My uncle did not look down at the book, but came around it and slapped me on the back. <br><br>&#x2014;Good, good, he said. (An embrace.) <br><br>&#x2014;You&#x2019;ve had your hair cut, haven&#x2019;t you? he asked. Cut with a straight razor, looks like. <br><br>&#x2014;Yes, I said, just now. I do it myself, a couple times a year. <br><br>&#x2014;You use a mirror? he asked. <br><br>&#x2014;No, I said, just a razor and a comb. In fact, I close my eyes. <br><br>&#x2014;Not bad, he said. It&#x2019;s the old way, isn&#x2019;t it? Way they used to do it . . . I&#x2019;d like to see that. Tell me next time, and I&#x2019;ll send the car. <br><br>He gave me another pat, then unhanded me, went back around the desk, and sat down with the air of a man who has often sat down in the presence of others who remain standing. <br><br>&#x2014;I have given your situation some thought, Selah. I understand there was this business in C., and I know it distracted you for a while, but god damn it, man, you&#x2019;ve got to get yourself together. These scraps of paper . . . <br><br>He held up several of my pamphlets. I sat up straight. <br><br>&#x2014;It just won&#x2019;t do you any good. No conceivable good. <br><br>&#x2014;I . . . <br><br>&#x2014;Enough of that, he said. I have conferred with some old friends and I am going to install you in a position of which I feel you are certainly capable. There is a man I know, Levkin. He&#x2019;s an odd man, but trustworthy. I think you can gain much from his acquaintance. <br><br>He pressed a button behind his desk, and a door on the far side of the room opened. A man came out. He had evidently been waiting there some time, but he gave no sign of it. Nodding to my uncle, he immediately addressed me. <br><br>&#x2014;Selah Morse? <br><br>I nodded. A strange-looking man. He was the sort you could never recall anything about afterwards. Featureless. Not that he didn&#x2019;t have features. He was of a certain height, of a certain weight, etc., but they didn&#x2019;t add up to anything. He was more of an average weight, an average height. If he left the room, who would remember him? <br><br>&#x2014;This way, please. <br><br>He looked at me as I stood there, book in hand. <br><br>My uncle nodded. <br><br>&#x2014;I think you&#x2019;ll find the work pleasant. <br><br>Come see me in a week or so. We&#x2019;ll lunch together. I know a place. . . . <br><br>But already I was following the featureless man through the paneling and down a set of stairs. <br><br>At the bottom of the stairs there was a passage that let out onto the street. I tried to place it in my memory in case I ever needed to get up to my uncle&#x2019;s office on the quick. In my head I imagined an enormous house, a mansion I had visited once as a boy. I walked in the front door, along the central hallway. On the right was a room made expressly for telephoning. I entered it, pulled tight the door. Beside the telephone on the nightstand, I placed the idea of this secret entranceway to my uncle&#x2019;s office. Quietly then I exit first the telephone-room, then the mansion, shutting carefully the doors. <br><br>&#x2014;Call me Levkin, the man said shortly. <br><br>I nodded. There was no need to say my name. <br><br>I followed Levkin down the block. He had a rapid way of walking with hardly any wasted motion. He turned several times, finally coming to a sort of pocket-park. In the center, a building. We crossed the park, mounted the steps, and entered, he turning in the lock a sort of monkey-faced key. <br><br>Within there was a large room. A desk stood opposite the door. On it a girl lay sleeping. She was quite slender, and expensively dressed. She gave one the impression of a cat, insomuch as were one to wake her it seemed she would only stalk off to some other equally unlikely napping place, there to resume her slumber. <br><br>I looked at Levkin. He had his finger over his lips. Softly he said: <br><br>&#x2014;That&#x2019;s Rita, the message-girl. <br><br>&#x2014;Messages for what? I whispered. <br><br>&#x2014;The Seventh Ministry. Municipal Inspection. <br><br>He passed on through a left-hand door into a long sort of sitting room. There were tables, chairs, and sofas, as well as a large armoire. He opened it. Inside were a great number of identical suits in various sizes. Identical to the suit he himself was wearing. It was an elegant suit, obviously costly, but very quiet. <br><br>&#x2014;Size? he said. <br><br>I reached past him and took the appropriate suit. <br><br>&#x2014;Your office is this way, he said. <br><br>We exited the sitting room and proceeded back past Rita, who was now awake and watching us with one of two eyes. I said nothing; she said nothing. <br><br>&#x2014;In here, said Levkin. <br><br>Through the right-hand door we went. A hallway led to the back of the house. There was a ladder on one side and a stair on the other. Levkin climbed up the ladder. I followed. At the top, a landing and a door. He opened the door. <br><br>&#x2014;Your office. On the desk, a letter in explanation. Rita may or may not be up soon with your tea. <br><br>Levkin did a sort of half bow, and vanished back through the door and down the ladder,&nbsp; leaving me to survey my new premises. It was a fine room. A very long window ran much of the way along the wall, giving a view out onto the park. A dog was chasing another dog, which was chasing the first dog unsuccessfully. I felt that this meant something. I wrote it down on a pad of paper. <br><br>Dog chasing dog itself chasing dog, but not fast enough. <br><br>I illustrated the note, took a tack, and pinned it to the wall beside my desk. As I did this, Rita entered and leaned against the wall. <br><br>&#x2014;Dressing up the place? she asked. <br><br>&#x2014;Is that my tea? I asked. <br><br>&#x2014;It can be. <br><br>She crossed the room and set the tea down on a small table by the window. With a sigh she threw herself down into a large leather chair and sat watching me. <br><br>I shook my head. I picked the suit up, went into the bathroom, and changed into it, slowly and carefully. The experience was enormously pleasing. Never had I been in possession of such a fine suit. It fit perfectly. Pants, shirt, vest. There was even a pocket watch. <br><br>Rita entered the room. <br><br>&#x2014;Not bad, she said, and held the suit coat up for me. <br><br>I slid it on. <br><br>&#x2014;Milk and sugar, I said. Or, just honey. If you&#x2019;re going to do something, you might as well . . . <br><br>&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll write that down somewhere and lose it, she said. The suit fits. Not bad. I imagine you don&#x2019;t know a thing about what goes on here, do you? <br><br>&#x2014;I know enough, I retorted. <br><br>&#x2014;We&#x2019;ll see, she said. If you know anything at all, then why do we keep all our clocks three hours ahead? <br><br>We went out into the main room. Sure enough, the clock was three hours ahead. <br><br>&#x2014;Well, that&#x2019;s obvious enough, I said. But I&#x2019;m busy. Don&#x2019;t you have something to do? <br><br>&#x2014;Try figuring out why you have . . . <br><br>She reached into the sleeve of my suit and pulled a long white handkerchief out of a secret pocket. It was monogrammed: S. M. <br><br>&#x2014;. . . secret pockets in your clothing. Tell me that, buster. <br><br>She spun around and left out a different door, one on the far side of the room. <br><br>Only after she was gone did I wonder, how had she climbed the ladder with a cup of tea on a saucer? Evidently there was more to Rita than met the eye, though what met the eye was just fine. <br><br>Turning back to the desk I found an envelope. Within there was a letter, two days old. <br><br>Seventh Ministry 21 July xxxx <br>Mr. Selah Morse, <br><br>Imagine that you are being written to from a place no larger than a gourd. In this gourd, furthermore, the necessary supplies for writing letters do not exist. Therefore, we make do with other mediums. Or perhaps this business of the gourd is a lie, a simple way of beginning a letter that I had hoped I would never have to write. The simple matter is this&#x2014;up until now there has always been one Municipal Inspector in the city. For there to be two, well, I simply was not prepared for the circumstance to arise. Yet here you are. <br><br>I have it on good authority from Rita, the message-girl, that you cannot be trusted with any task, and that we should despair of your ever becoming a useful member of our little cadre. However, at the time of her saying this, Rita was operating under the clever assumption that you were only an idea and not an actual person. The contrary, rather, is the case. You are an actual person, and the work that you have to accomplish here is merely an idea. <br><br>Do you understand? We inspect things.&nbsp; We go about the city and occasionally stir ourselves to inspect virtually anything we choose. Our authority is both unlimited and nonexistent. It operates on a case-by-case basis. On a given day I might have the power to shut down a dam. The next I cannot cause a street vendor to move from off a corner. Vaguer and vaguer! I&#x2019;m sure you understand now. After all, you were recommended to us as a sly young man. This you had best prove. <br><br>Senior Inspector, Seventh Ministry <br><br>Mars Levkin <br><br>I set the paper down. By the window I found my tea. It was quite cold. In fact, it looked like someone had been ashing a cigarette in it. <br><br>&#x2014;That wasn&#x2019;t for you to drink, said Rita, opening the door again. <br><br>She had a tray this time. On the tray was another envelope, and a cup of tea. She brought it over and set it down gently. <br><br>&#x2014;I&#x2019;m Rita the message-girl, she said. <br><br>&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve been told that, I replied. <br><br>She adjusted the hem of her skirt. <br><br>&#x2014;Any messages to send? she said. <br><br>&#x2014;Could you tell Levkin that&#x2014; <br><br>&#x2014;No! she said. Only written messages. What sort of message girl do you think I am? <br><br>She stalked off, leaving me with the tea and letter. <br><br>I took a sip of the tea. Irish Breakfast, with just the right amount of milk and sugar. Thank you, Rita. I opened the letter. <br><br>Seventh Ministry 21 <br>July xxxx <br>M.I. Selah Morse, <br><br>I do hope you&#x2019;re settling in. Things have been dreadfully strange around here ever since Maude ran away (the gray tabby). I think you are quite handsome and pleasant to talk to, and you mustn&#x2019;t get the wrong idea about me. I am excited to see if you can do the work, and if you like it. Also, I had a cousin named Selah who died when he was very young. He died right after he learned to read. The doctor said some people aren&#x2019;t meant to read. No one knows if he was joking or not, but we have to assume so. Was it a funny joke? I have never been in a position to tell. Anyway, good-bye for now, <br><br>Rita Liszt, M.G. <br><br>Seventh Ministry <br><br>I closed the letter and smiled to myself. On an ordinary day, I would be reading in the park or working on one of my pamphlets in my cramped apartment. Was it true? Had I really come up in the world? I inspected my clothing for secret pockets and found several more, including a rather clever one that went all the way down the pant leg, starting beneath a false belt loop. Or, I suppose, the belt loop was a belt loop truthfully. But it also had this other business of being the start of a secret pocket. <br><br>HOWEVER, the true business began later, and about that we will now speak. <br><br>Several months, perhaps six or nine, had passed since I had begun work as an inspector. I was quite used to my schedule and to my responsibilities. It was late in the day, when afternoon has begun quite visibly to crumple around the edges and one can smell rather than sense that evening will soon be upon us. Quite the opposite is true in winter, when one sees night approaching from afar on spindly noiseless legs. But now it was the spring, and I was heading towards a noodle shop happily situated between a sort of pretend-dadaist gallery and an old movie theater named the Grand Corazon. Whenever I was in that neighborhood I made a point of stopping by the noodle shop. <br><br>As I walked, a girl came out of a doorway ahead of me and paused in the street. She was very happy, perhaps as happy as a person could be; one could tell this at a glance. She looked up at the second-story window. It was closed. Presumably she had just come from the apartment to which it belonged. The girl was quite fine-looking, with bare shoulders and a beauty that I have always ascribed to the Han dynasty of ancient China. Not that she was Chinese. No, I didn&#x2019;t know what she was, Slavic maybe, and elegant. <br><br>Out of nowhere, a taxi came speeding. There was a great honking of horns, a shouting. The girl made as though to jump back onto the curb, but instead went the other way, out into the street. With a dreadful thud, the braking taxi smashed full into the girl, sending her flying up into the air to land flat on the pavement some twenty feet away. The whole thing was rather like a geometry problem. Except that one could see immediately how truly injured the girl was, and one oughtn&#x2019;t to say such things or even think them at such times. <br><br>I dropped the brown paper parcel I was carrying and ran to where she lay. One isn&#x2019;t supposed to lift or move people who have been struck by dynamically heavy and fast-moving objects; however, I couldn&#x2019;t help but lift the girl off the street. She was completely unconscious. All her gladness had paused a moment. <br><br>&#x2014;Driver! I shouted.</p><h2>Reynard the Fox: A New Translation</h2><p><p><strong>One of the greatest characters of medieval literature, the trickster Reynard the Fox, comes to life in this rollicking new translation.</strong></p><p>What do a weak lion king, a grief-stricken rooster, a dim-witted bear, and one really angry wolf have in common? The answer is they&#x2019;ve all been had by one sly fox named Reynard. Originally bursting forth from Europe in the twelfth century, <em>Reynard the Fox</em>&#x2015;a classic trickster narrative centered on a wily and gleefully amoral fox and his numerous victims in the animal kingdom&#x2015;anticipated both Tex Avery and <em>The Prince</em> by showing that it&#x2019;s better to be clever than virtuous. However, where <em>The Prince</em> taught kings how to manipulate their subjects, <em>Reynard the Fox</em> demonstrated how, in a world of ruthless competition, clever subjects could outwit both their rulers and enemies alike.</p><p>In these riotous pages, Reynard lies, cheats, or eats anyone and anything that he crosses paths with, conning the likes of Tybert the Cat, Bruin the Bear, and Bellin the Ram, among others. Reynard's rapacious nature and constant "stealing and roving" eventually bring him into conflict with the court of the less-than-perceptive Noble the Lion and the brutal Isengrim the Wolf, pitting cunning trickery against brute force. Unlike the animal fables of Aesop, which use small narratives to teach schoolboy morality, <em>Reynard the Fox</em> employs a dark and outrageous sense of humor to puncture the hypocritical authority figures of the &#x201c;civilized&#x201d; order, as the rhetorically brilliant fox outwits all comers by manipulating their bottomless greed.</p><p>As James Simpson, one of the world&#x2019;s leading scholars of medieval literature, notes in his introduction, with translations in every major European language and twenty-three separate editions between 1481 and 1700 in England alone, the Reynard tales were ubiquitous. However, despite its immense popularity at the time, this brains-over-brawn parable largely disappeared. Now, for the first time in over a century, the fifteenth-century version of <em>Reynard the Fox</em> reemerges in this rollicking translation.</p><p>Readers both young and old will be delighted by Reynard&#x2019;s exploits, as he excels at stitching up the vain, pompous, and crooked and escapes punishment no matter how tight the noose. Highlighted by new illustrations by Edith E. Newman, Simpson's translation of the late Middle English Caxton edition restores this classic as a part of a vital tradition that extends all the way to Br&#x2019;er Rabbit, Bugs Bunny, and even Itchy &amp; Scratchy. As Stephen Greenblatt writes in his foreword, Reynard is the "animal fable's version of Homer's Odysseus, the man of many wiles," proving that in a dog-eat-dog world the fox reigns supreme.</p> 12 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>James Simpson</strong> is the Donald P. and Katherine B.

And all of us like laughing. And all of us are fascinated by animals, not least because we are ourselves animals who need to pretend otherwise.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Simpson, from the introduction</strong><br><br>&#x201c;[<em>Reynard the Fox</em>] is clearly a satire, one that exposes the greed, corruption, and lying that poison institutions and social relations, above all at court...It helps, of course, that this is an animal fable, so what might otherwise seem like pages taken from <em>King Lear</em> or <em>Othello</em> come across as episodes from a "Road Runner" cartoon or an episode of <em>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show</em>. Still more, the literary artistry of <em>Reynard the Fox</em>&#x2015;its pace, its deft twists of plot, its zany characters, and its savage humor&#x2015;persuades us that to survive in this world it is more important to pretend to be good than actually to be good. To this extent at least, Reynard is the secret twin of his great contemporary Niccolo Machiavelli.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Stephen Greenblatt from the foreword</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Reynard...is one of the defining documents of a vast tradition in Western art, indeed, in Western consciousness: the trickster tale.... [James] Simpson says that his version is the first readily accessible English translation to appear in almost a hundred years. I am glad that he rescued it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joan Acocella, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong></p><h2>A Natural History Of The Hedgerow</h2><p>From where I sit writing Postscript entries, I look out on an old Devon hedgerow and an ancient stone wall; John Wright&#39;s Natural History has rendered them both very much more interesting. The book covers the origins and history of such boundaries; the present condition of hedgerows and the need to preserve them; the amazing array of fauna and flora they support; and other ways of making boundaries, from movable hazel hurdles to dry stone walls (mine, I&#39;ve learned, is the &#39;random rubble&#39; type).</p><p>John Wright is a naturalist and one of Great Britain&#39;s leading experts on fungi. His most recent book, The Naming of the Shrew: A Curious History of Latin Names was published by Bloomsbury in 2014.

Amid 3,500 acres of farmland in the countryside near Pienza, with sweeping views of the Tuscan landscape, La Foce was the childhood dream garden of the late writer Marchesa Iris Origo. Passionate about the order and symmetry of Florentine gardens, Origo and her husband, Antonio, purchased the dilapidated villa in 1924, soliciting the help of English architect and family friend Cecil Pinsent to reawaken the natural magic of the property. Pinsent designed the structure of simple, elegant, box-edged beds and green enclosures that give shape to the Origos' shrubs, perennials, and vines, and created a garden of soaring cypress walks, native cyclamen, lawns, and wildflower meadows. It is, by all accounts, a remarkable achievement.</p><p>Today the garden is a place of unusual and striking beauty, a green oasis in the barren Siena countryside. Situated in the Val d'Orcia, a wide valley in southeastern Tuscany that seems to exist on a larger, wilder scale than the rest of the Tuscan landscape, it is run by Benedetta and Donata Origo, and is open to the public one day a week.</p><p><i>La Foce: A Garden and Landscape in Tuscany</i> is a contemplative, multifaceted study of the house, gardens, and estate of La Foce. It includes a historical essay and memoir by the daughter of La Foce's creators, Antonio and Iris Origo, along with photographs, sketches, and a critical analysis of the gardens. The volume not only focuses on the beauty of the gardens themselves and their indisputable merit as fascinating works of landscape architecture but also sees them within the context of both the larger Tuscan topography and the wider landscape of geography and history. The book will be a delight to armchair travelers, trade and landscape architects, gardeners, and those interested in Tuscan culture.</p></p><p>Benedetta Origo is a musician and owner of La Foce; Morna Livingston is Professor of Design, Drawing, and Vernacular Architecture at Philadelphia University; Laurie Olin is a Practicing Professor of Landscape Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and Principal of Olin Partnership; John Dixon Hunt is Professor of Landscape Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania.<p>"A feast to the eyes and an excellent read."&#x2014;<i>Hortus</i></p></p><h2>Presumption of Guilt (Suncoast Chronicles Series #4)</h2><p><p>Just one person can save the children from a terrifying future.

Fr Schmemann was known for his many-faceted and eloquent gifts as preacher, professor and priest. His insight into contemporary culture, church life and liturgical celebration left an indelible mark on generations of Christians. These journals offer insight into the quiet, intimate side of his life. They witness the magnitude of his heart, his absolute humanity. Translated and edited by his wife, the abridged journals reveal his recollections and experiences and record his formative creative thought on all manner of subjects. Fr Schmemann writes, &#39;The meaning of this journal is not so much a desire to record events, but a kind of visit into myself.&#39; They record, often with brutal honesty, his impatience and frustration with himself and events, but above all, his liberation and freedom &#39;in Christ and His Church.&#39; We see a life replete with the effort to call people to live &#39;higher and more openly,&#39; to become restored human beings.

The last carriage, with its two occupants, was disappearing down the street. Those few theatergoers who had come on foot had long ago set out on their way.<br><br>It appeared that only one gentleman was left, a tall man in a dark cloak and hat. He had refused a ride in the last carriage to leave, preferring, he had told his friends, to walk home.<br><br>And yet he was not the sole remaining occupant of the street, either. His eyes, as he looked about him, were caught by a figure standing quietly against the building, her cloak a shade lighter than the night shadows--a street prostitute who had been left behind by her more fortunate or alluring peers and who seemed now to have lost all chance of a fashionable customer for the night.<br><br>She did not move, and it was impossible to tell in the darkness if she was looking at him. She might have swaggered toward him. She might have moved out of the shadows and smiled at him. She might have hailed him, offered herself in words. She might have hurried away to find a more promising location.<br><br>She did none of those things.<br><br>And he stood looking at her, wondering whether to begin the solitary walk home he had planned or whether to engage in an unplanned night of sport. He could not see the woman clearly. He did not know if she was young, enticing, pretty, clean--any of those qualities that might make it worth his while to change his plans.<br><br>But there was her quiet stillness, intriguing in itself.<br><br>She was looking at him, he saw as he strolled toward her, with eyes that were dark in the shadows. <br>She wore a cloak but no bonnet. Her hair was dressed neatly at the back of her head. It was impossible to tell how old she was or how pretty. She said nothing and did not move. She displayed no wiles, spoke no words of enticement.<br><br>He stopped a few feet in front of her. He noted that her head reached to his shoulder--she was slightly above average height--and that she was of slim build.<br><br>"You wish for a night's employment?" he asked her.<br><br>She nodded almost imperceptibly.<br><br>"And your price?"<br><br>She hesitated and named a sum. He regarded her in silence for a few moments.<br><br>"And the place is close by?"<br><br>"I have no place," she said. Her voice was soft, devoid of either the harshness or the cockney accent that he had expected.<br><br>He looked at her out of narrowed eyes. He should begin his walk home, make a companion of his own thoughts as he had planned to do. It had never been his way to copulate with a street whore in a shop doorway.<br><br>"There is an inn on the next street," he said, and he turned to walk in its direction.<br><br>She fell into step beside him. They did not exchange a word. She made no move to take his arm. He did not offer it.<br><br>She followed him into the crowded and rowdy taproom of the Bull and Horn and stood quietly at his shoulder as he engaged a room abovestairs for the night and paid for it in advance. She followed him up the stairs, her feet light on the treads so that he half-turned his head before reaching the top to make sure that she was there.<br><br>He allowed her to precede him into the room and closed and bolted the door behind him. He set the single candle he had brought up with him in a wall sconce. The noise from the taproom was hardly diminished by distance.<br><br>The prostitute was standing in the middle of the room, looking at him. She was young, he saw, though not a girl. She must have been pretty at one time, but now her face was thin and pale, her lips dry and cracked, her brown eyes ringed by dark shadows. Her hair, a dull red in color, was without luster or body. She wore it in a simple knot at the back of her head.<br><br>The gentleman removed his top hat and cloak and saw her eyes move over his face and along the ugly scar that began at the corner of his left eye, slashed across his cheek to the corner of his mouth and on down to his chin. He felt all his ugliness, with his near-black unruly hair, his dark eyes, his great aquiline nose. And it angered him to feel ugly in the eyes of a common whore.<br><br>He strode across the room, unbuttoned her pale gray cloak, which she had made no move to take off herself, and threw it aside.<br><br>Surprisingly, she wore a blue silk dress beneath it, long-sleeved, modestly low at the bosom, high-waisted, unadorned. But the dress, though clean, was limp and creased. A gift from a satisfied customer some weeks before and worn nightly ever since, he guessed.<br><br>Her chin lifted an inch. She watched him steadily.<br><br>"Take your clothes off," he said, unnerved by her quietness, by her differentness from all the whores he had known in his youth and during his years in the army. He seated himself on a hard-backed chair beside the empty fireplace and watched her with narrowed eyes.<br><br>She did not move for a few moments, but then she began to undress, folding each garment as she removed it and setting it on the floor beside her. She was no longer watching him, but kept her eyes on what she was doing. Only when she came to her chemise, her last remaining garment, did she hesitate, her eyes on the floor at her feet. But she removed that too, drawing it up over her head, folding it as she had done her other garments, and dropping it to the top of the pile.<br><br>She set her arms loosely at her sides and looked at him again, her eyes steady and expressionless, as they had been before.<br><br>She was too thin. Far too thin. And yet there was something about the long slimness of her legs, about the shape of her hips and the too-small waist, about the high firm breasts that stirred the gentleman who watched her. For the first time he was glad of his decision to engage her services. It had been a long time.<br><br>"Unpin your hair," he told her.<br><br>And she lifted thin arms to do so and bent to set the pins carefully beside the pile of her clothes. Her hair fell over her shoulders and about her face and halfway down her back when she straightened again. Clean, lifeless hair, not red, not blond. She lifted a hand to remove one strand from her mouth, her eyes steady on his.<br><br>He felt a surging of lust.<br><br>"Lie down on the bed," he told her as he got to his feet and began to undress himself.<br><br>She folded the bedclothes back neatly and lay on one side of the bed, her legs together, her arms at her sides, her palms against the mattress. She did not cover herself. She turned her head to one side and watched him.<br><br>He undressed completely. He scorned to try to hide himself from a whore, to try to hide the purple and disfiguring marks of the wounds on his left side and left leg, which even in a mirror made him grimace with distaste, and which must repel any stranger not expecting them. Her eyes moved down to them and then returned calmly to his face.<br><br>She had courage, this whore. Or perhaps she could not afford to lose even the most repulsive of customers before she had earned her pay.<br><br>He was angry. Angry with himself for returning to whoring, something he had given up years before. Angry that he felt self-conscious and ashamed with a prostitute. And angry with her for being so much in control of her feelings that she would not even show her revulsion at his appearance. If she had done so, he could have used her accordingly.<br><br>And the thought revolted him and angered him further.<br><br>He leaned across her and took her by the upper arms, moving her so that she lay across the bed instead of along it. He grasped her hips and drew her forward until her knees bent over the side of the bed and her feet rested on the floor.<br><br>He slid his palms between her thighs and spread her legs wide. He pushed them wider with his knees, bending his legs so that they rested against the side of the bed. And he spread his fingers across the tops of her legs and opened her with his thumbs.<br><br>Her eyes were lowered, watching what he did.<br><br>He positioned himself and mounted her with one sharp deep thrust.<br><br>He heard the sound of shock deep in her throat and watched her bite down on both lips at once and shut her eyes very tightly. He felt all her muscles tense in self-defense. And he waited, standing above her, buried deep in her, watching her with hooded eyes, until the breath came vibrating out of her and she imposed relaxation on her muscles. Her eyes were fixed on his.<br><br>He slid his hands beneath her, holding her steady above the mattress as he leaned over her and took the pleasure for which he had employed her. She remained still and relaxed as he moved swiftly and deeply in her, her arms spread across the bed at her sides, her eyes wandering over his facial scar and looking back up into his. Once she looked down to watch what he did to her. Her hair was spread across the mattress to one side of her, where he had moved her across the bed.<br><br>He closed his eyes as he released into her, and bowed his head over her until he could feel her breath against his hair. And along with the blessed relaxation he felt the stabbing of a nameless regret.<br><br>He straightened up and disengaged himself from her body. He turned away to the washstand opposite the foot of the bed and poured cold water from the pitcher into the cracked bowl, dipped the rag of a cloth into it, squeezed out the excess water, and returned to the bed.<br><br>"Here," he said, holding out the cloth to her. She had not moved beyond bringing her legs together. Her feet still rested on the floor. Her eyes were still open. "Clean yourself with this." He glanced down to her bloodstained thighs.<br><br>She raised one hand to take the cloth, but it was shaking so out of control that she lowered it to the bed again and turned her head to one side, closing her eyes. He took her hand in his, turned it palm-up, and placed the cloth in it.<br><br>"You may dress when you have finished," he said, and he turned his back on her in order to dress himself.<br><br>The quiet rustlings behind him told him that she had brought herself under control and was doing as she had been told. And yet when he turned at last, it was to find her trying to do up the three buttons of her cloak with hands that were trembling too badly to accomplish the task. He took the few steps toward her, brushed her hands aside, and did the buttons up for her.<br><br>The sheet at the edge of the bed, he could see over her shoulder, was liberally stained with blood. He had ripped her quite effectively.<br><br>"When did you last eat?" he asked her.<br><br>She straightened her cloak, looking down at it.<br><br>"When I ask a question, I expect an answer," he said curtly.<br><br>"Two days ago," she said.<br><br>"And what did you eat then?"<br><br>"Some bread."<br><br>"Was it only today you decided to turn to the profession of whore?" he asked.<br><br>"No," she said. "Yesterday. But no one wanted me."<br><br>"I am not surprised," he said. "You have no idea how to sell yourself."<br><br>He took up his hat, unbolted the door, and left the room. She followed him. He paused at the foot of the stairs and looked about the noisy taproom. There was an empty table in a far corner. He turned, took the girl by the elbow, and crossed the room toward it. Any customer who was in his path took one look at him, at his fashionable clothes and harsh, scarred face, and instantly moved to one side.<br><br>He seated the girl with her back to the room and took the seat opposite her. He instructed the barmaid, who had followed them to the table and was bobbing curtsies to him, to bring a plate of food and two tankards of ale.<br><br>"I am not hungry," the girl said.<br><br>"You will eat," he said.<br><br>She did not speak again. The barmaid brought a plate on which were a large and steaming meat pie and two thick slices of bread and butter, and he gestured to her to set it before the prostitute.<br><br>The gentleman watched the girl eat. It was very obvious that she was ravenous, though she made an effort to eat slowly. She looked about her when her fingers, which still trembled, were covered with crumbs of meat and pastry, but of course it was a common inn and there were no napkins. He handed her a linen handkerchief from his pocket, and she took it after a moment's hesitation and wiped her fingers.<br><br>"Thank you," she said.<br><br>"What is your name?" he asked.<br><br>She finished chewing the bread she had in her mouth. "Fleur," she said eventually.<br><br>"Just Fleur?" He was drumming his fingers slowly on the top of the table. He held his tankard of ale in his other hand.<br><br>"Just Fleur," she said quietly.<br><br>He watched her silently until she had eaten the last crumb on her plate.<br><br>"You want more?" he asked her.<br><br>"No." She looked up at him hastily. "No, thank you."<br><br>"You don't want to finish your ale?"<br><br>"No, thank you," she said.<br><br>He paid the bill and they left the inn together.<br><br>"You said you had no place in which to ply your trade," he said. "Do you have no home?"<br><br>"Yes," she said. "I have a room."<br><br>"I will escort you there," he said.<br><br>"No." She hung back in the doorway of the Bull and Horn.<br><br>"How far away do you live?" he asked.<br><br>"Not far," she said. "About a mile."<br><br>"I will take you three-quarters of a mile, then," he said. "You are an innocent. You do not know what can happen to a woman alone on the streets."<br><br>She gave a harsh little laugh. And she hurried along the street, her head down. He walked beside her, experiencing for the first time in his life, though only at second hand, all the despair of poverty, knowing that his own problems, his own reasons for unhappiness, were laughable in comparison with those of this girl, London's newest whore.</p><h2>Myths, Lies and Oil Wars</h2><p><p>Check the Amazon Reviews.

Here is some of what you will learn about how this works in our modern world on reading Myths, Lies and Oil Wars:</p> <p> + The true origins of the pseudo-scientific Peak Oil theory and the role of Shell Oil in it going back to the 1950's<br> + How a 400% rise in world oil prices was brought about by Henry Kissinger and a secretive group of very influential European and US businessmen meeting in May, 1973 in Saltsjoebaden, Sweden<br> + The decisive role of the Anglo-American oil majors in creation of the Malthusian zero growth movement of the 1970s, and the true origins of the Global Warming ideology<br> + How modern eugenics and the major oil companies are linked<br> + The relation between Saddam Hussein and the CIA in the 1980's Iran-Iraq War<br> + How the Chechyn wars in the 1990s were tied to British and US oil pipeline strategies<br> + How Washington is maneuvering to control vital oil supply lines of China in the future in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia </p> <p>These are only a few of the fascinating and little-known facets of the world of oil and how it controls much of our daily lives.</p> <p>The myth of oil scarcity has allowed four giant corporations along with a handful of Wall Street banks to control the world's largest and most essential commodity, oil. The myth originated in the 1950's from a geologist at Royal Dutch Shell. It was revived in 2003 in time for the US bombing of Iraq. The reality is quite different from claims of Peak Oil. In reality the world is running into oil and not running out of oil. In Myths, Lies and Oil Wars F. William Engdahl discusses little-known details of wars and manipulations designed over the past half century or more-- wars in Africa, the &#x2018;Arab Spring&#x2019;, Iraq-- all to maintain a lock-grip control of the world's known oilfields. The myth of scarcity has been a pillar of their power and in fact of the power-projection of the United States as sole superpower. </p> <p>The book details revolutionary and shocking new scientific work developed in Cold War secrecy in the Soviet Union which proved that oil originates not from dinosaur detritus or fossilized algae as western geology mythology maintains. The Soviet scientists showed that oil and gas have deep origins at the level of the Earth's mantle some 200 km below. Like volcanoes, hydrocarbons are forced upwards until they typically are "trapped" in reservoir rock formations. The Russian work has been the target of a concerted campaign to discredit the theory. Little wonder. Were its implications understood widely, oil and gas would be considered as virtually a renewable energy and our energy crises and wars a thing of the past. As Henry Kissinger said, "If you control the oil you control entire nations." The converse is also true--If oil cannot be controlled the controlling powers lose their control over other nations and the wars that go with it. This is an entirely different account of the world's most important and most political commodity--oil.</p></p><p>F.

I&#x2019;m a candy maker, and the tools of my trade are imagination and sugar. I believe in magic. Especially the type of magic brought about by spinning my wildest dreams into something sweet to eat. There&#x2019;s no way to argue it, magic is responsible for getting me to where I am today. It&#x2019;s squeezed its way into every facet of my being, and it&#x2019;s given me the ability to approach daily life with a specific sense of wonder and enchantment&#x2014;two of the required qualities of a candy maker, I&#x2019;m certain. There&#x2019;s very little that I do that I don&#x2019;t approach with a bright-eyed sense of enthusiasm. And if you&#x2019;ve heard me speak, have met me at a candy demonstration, or have taken one of my classes, you know that everything I&#x2019;m saying here is the exact truth: I&#x2019;m completely wild about making candy.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t remember a time when I wasn&#x2019;t speaking the language of sweets. I don&#x2019;t remember a time when I wasn&#x2019;t analyzing bites of cookies or spoonfuls of ice cream. Chocolate and frozen treats, cakes and biscuits, candy and cookies, hot fudge and caramel sauce&#x2014;these are my constants. They are my rewards, my gifts, my consolation prizes, my companions, and my coworkers.<br><br>In 2005, armed with a family of recipes and a tireless spirit, I opened my first retail bakery. I had just entered my thirties, I was not yet a mom, and I had just ended a successful career as a marketer for engineers and lawyers. Baking as a job was something I could visualize but never thought of as possible, until I made it possible.&nbsp;<br><br>Right from the beginning, the days were long. I opened the business in November, and, leading up to that first Thanksgiving, I was easily spending twenty-two-hour days in the bakery turning out pumpkin pies and nutmeg ice cream. I was so happy to be baking that I wouldn&#x2019;t even realize when twenty-two hours had ticked by. Elbow deep in sugar, butter, and flour was exactly where I wanted to be.&nbsp;<br><b> strawberry lollipops&nbsp;</b><br><br> Here&#x2019;s a recipe for fruit lollipops made with roasted strawberry purï¿½e and natural flavoring.<br><br> MAKES ABOUT SIXTY 1-1/2-INCH LOLLIPOPS&nbsp;<br><br>267 grams glucose syrup&nbsp;<br> 400 grams granulated sugar&nbsp;<br> 150 grams water&nbsp;<br> 20 grams roasted strawberry purï¿½e&nbsp;<br> 18 grams natural strawberry flavoring&nbsp;<br><br> Set up the lollipop station.<br>&nbsp;<br> Weigh the glucose syrup, sugar, and water directly into a heavy-bottomed pot, then set the pot over medium-high heat and bring the lollipop syrup to a boil. Once the syrup is boiling, swirl the pot often to make sure the sugar is cooking evenly. At first the syrup will bubble fast and light. Then it starts to slow down and the bubbles get a bit slower and thicker. This means the syrup is nearly ready.&nbsp;<br><br>Test the temperature of the syrup; as soon as it reaches 315ï¿½F, remove the pot from the heat. Give the candy syrup a good stir, then add the strawberry purï¿½e and the strawberry flavoring. (If you are making one of the variations, add any substitutions at this point.) Whisk together the contents of the pot until the candy no longer looks foamy and any active bubbling has stopped.&nbsp;<br><br>Using great care, immediately pour the syrup into a candy funnel or spouted cup and pour the lollipops as directed on page 114. Let the lollipops sit for about 30 minutes, until completely cool and hard. They are now ready for wrapping.</p><h2>Songbird Carving</h2><p>Songbird Carving is a unique book that can be appreciated on two levels: first, as a step-by-step set of instructions, with exquisite photographs and hand-drawn illustrations covering techniques of carving, texturing, painting and mounting of five songbird projects; second, as a work of art unto itself. The five songbird projects featured are the Black-capped Chickadee, Tufted titmouse, American Goldfinch, House Wren, and Catbird. To complement the instructions there are chapters on tools and supplies, the basics of carving song birds, and the birds habitats. The carefully organized text and clear step-by-step illustrations provided an unsurpassed guide to this form of carving.</p><p>Rosalyn Daisey has been carving wildlife for over 30 years.

Sailing through poorly charted waters, Anson and his men encountered disaster, disease, and astonishing success. They circumnavigated the globe and seized a nearly incalcuable sum of Spanish gold and silver, but only one of the five ships survived.<br><br> This is the background to the first novel Patrick O'Brian ever wrote about the sea, a precursor to the acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series that shares the excitement and rich humor of those books.

Together with his lifelong friend Sean, Peter sets out to seek his fortune, embarking upon a journey of danger, disappointment, foreign lands, and excitement.<br><br> Here is a tale certain to please not only admirers of O'Brian's work but also any reader with an adventurous soul.<br></p><p>O'Brian's first sea-going novel, <b>The Golden Ocean</b> is a precurser to the acclaimed Aubrey-Maturin series in its excitement and rich humor, its eloquent style and and tapestry of historical detail. Peter Palofox, second son of a poor Irish parson, sets out on the voyage of a lifetime when he seeks his fortune as a midshipman in Commodore Anson's flotilla. With five ships under his command, Anson leaves England in 1740 to circumnavigate the globe and attack Spanish ships wherever they can be found. Peter comes of age in the complex but sharply defined community of the fleet as they engage in battle, fight disease, and face shipwreck.<strong>Patrick O'Brian</strong>'s acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series of historical novels has been described as "a masterpiece" (David Mamet, <em>New York Times</em>), "addictively readable" (Patrick T. Reardon, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>), and "the best historical novels ever written" (Richard Snow, <em>New York Times Book Review</em>), which "should have been on those lists of the greatest novels of the 20th century" (George Will).<br><br> Set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, O'Brian's twenty-volume series centers on the enduring friendship between naval officer Jack Aubrey and physician (and spy) Stephen Maturin. <em>The Far Side of the World</em>, the tenth book in the series, was adapted into a 2003 film directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. The film was nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Picture. The books are now available in hardcover, paperback, and e-book format.<br><br> In addition to the Aubrey/Maturin novels, Patrick O'Brian wrote several books including the novels <em>Testimonies</em>, <em>The Golden Ocean</em>, and <em>The Unknown Shore</em>, as well as biographies of Joseph Banks and Picasso. He translated many works from French into English, among them the novels and memoirs of Simone de Beauvoir, the first volume of Jean Lacouture's biography of Charles de Gaulle, and famed fugitive Henri Cherriere's memoir <em>Papillon</em>.

There&#x2019;s Pru, the former grad student turned spreadsheet drone; Laars, the hysteric whose work anxiety stalks him in his tooth-grinding dreams; and Jack II, who distributes unwanted backrubs&#x2013;aka &#x201c;jackrubs&#x201d;&#x2013;to his co-workers.<br><br>On a Sunday, one of them is called at home. And the Firings begin.<br>Rich with Orwellian doublespeak, filled with sabotage and romance, this astonishing literary debut is at once a comic delight and a narrative tour de force. It&#x2019;s a novel for anyone who has ever worked in an office and wondered: &#x201c;Where does the time go? Where does the life go? And whose banana is in the fridge?&#x201d;<br><br>Praise for PERSONAL DAYS<br>"Witty and appealing...Anyone who has ever groaned to hear 'impact' used as a verb will cheer as Park skewers the avatars of corporate speak, hellbent on debasing the language....Park has written what one of his characters calls 'a layoff narrative' for our times.

There was a time when we all dressed crisply, but something&#x2019;s changed this summer. Now while the weather lasts we wear loose pants, canvas sneakers, clogs. Pru slips on flip-flops under her desk. It&#x2019;s so hot out and thus every day is potentially casual Friday. We have carte blanche to wear T-shirts featuring the comical logos of exterminating companies, advertising slogans from the early &#x2019;80s. Where&#x2019;s the beef? We dress like we don&#x2019;t make much money, which is true for at least half of us. The trick is figuring out which half. We go out for drinks together one or two nights a week, sometimes three, to take the edge off. Three is too much. We make careful note of who buys a round, who sits back and lets the booze magically appear. It&#x2019;s possible we can&#x2019;t stand each other but at this point we&#x2019;re helpless in the company of outsiders. Sometimes one of the guys will come to work in a coat and tie, just to freak the others out. On these days the guard in the lobby will joke, Who died? And we will laugh or pretend to laugh. <br><br><b><i>The Sprout <br></i></b>In summer the Sprout, our boss, suggests we form a softball team. His name is actually Russell. We refer to him as the Sprout, because <br>Russell -&gt;Brussels-&gt;brussels-&gt; sprouts-&gt; the Sprout. <br><br>No one knows who came up with the name first. <br>We&#x2019;re incredibly mature. <br>Also once in a while he has a bit of comb-proof hair sprouting from his scalp&#x2019;s left rear quadrant. <br>Jonah says it&#x2019;s hard to take the Sprout seriously because he&#x2019;s always using i.e. and e.g. in his sentences, vigorously but interchangeably, a mark of weak character. <br>He sometimes gives us little salutes when he sees us in the hall. Lately he&#x2019;s been flashing the peace sign. Sixty-five percent of the time he acts like he&#x2019;s our friend but we should remember the saying: <i>Friends don&#x2019;t fire friends. </i><br><br><b><i>Sticks and carrots</i></b> <br><i>Sixty-five percent of the time</i> is what the Sprout would call a <i>guesstimate</i>. He&#x2019;s always breaking things down into precise percentages. He used to be almost normal to talk to, but now he&#x2019;ll ask if we&#x2019;re on the <i>same page</i> and say something is a no-brainer, all in a single sentence. It&#x2019;s not just the frequency of these expressions but their haphazard use. Last week he told Laars to think outside the box. They were talking about which size manila folders worked best. Afterward he said, <i>Keep me in the loop and let&#x2019;s touch base next week.</i> Pru has wondered if the Sprout, a proud native of Canada, is taking a class in annoying American English. His new thing is a variation on <i>I gave you a carrot</i>, <i>but I also need to show you the stick</i>. So far this month, he&#x2019;s said it to Pru, to Jack II, to Laars. <i>So show us already</i>, Pru complains to Lizzie. <br>The Sprout understands that it sounds a little sadistic, and lets us know he recognizes this menacing aspect, at the same time wanting us to understand that he doesn&#x2019;t actually mean it in that way. Jonah&#x2019;s take on it is that he must mean it in that way, or else he&#x2019;d use another phrase. <br><br><b><i>A league record </i></b><br>Softball is a morale-boosting carrot that the Sprout most likely has read about in a handbook or learned at that seminar he goes to every March. Morale has been low since the Firings began last year. Pru says morale is a word thrown around only in the context of its absence. You never look at a hot young thing and say, Check out that spring chicken, but only use it to describe your great-aunt: She&#x2019;s no spring chicken. <br>Pru has a point. We tend to trust her, with her serious eyebrows and inevitable skeptical hmmm. She went to graduate school. We think it was in art history, but maybe it was regular history, the kind without the art. <br>We decide to give softball a shot. There are eight of us. In decreasing order of height: Laars, Jack II, Lizzie, Jonah, Jenny, Crease, Pru, Jill. We need a ninth, and Jack II happens to bump into Otto, who used to be in IT. He is now working somewhere in midtown and clearly has too much time on his hands. <br>It might be nice to rejuvenate our comically untoned bodies. Too many of us have been eating bagels at our desks, too many mornings in a row. We look like we&#x2019;ve been squeezed out of a tube and haven&#x2019;t quite solidified. Everyone has issues with posture except Lizzie, a corseter&#x2019;s dream. <br>Laars and Jenny are the only ones who have ever played softball before&#x2014;Laars at his last job, Jenny as a seven-year-old. The concept: You try to hit the ball hard but without so much upward arc that someone can catch it. Then you run in a square, or more properly a diamond, making sure to step on each base and not get tagged by someone bearing the ball. There are other rules that we never quite iron out. <br>Lizzie is having trouble seeing the carrot aspect of the game. <br>We buy mitts, glove oil, cleats. Laars buys two aluminum bats and two wooden ones. He buys a third kind of bat, a titanium hybrid that looks like a nuclear warhead. Laars can be seen doing push-ups near the storage area, counting off under his breath. <br>We have jerseys and caps printed with our emblem, a buxom elf winking and holding a pool cue. Jill found it on some Finnish clip-art site. <br>We prematurely end our season after losing the first game 17&#x2013;0, said to be a league record. What&#x2019;s left of our morale seeps away. We never see Otto again. All the gear gets returned, except the jerseys and caps. Autumn approaches, the air too cool for the jerseys, but we still wear the hats sometimes. <br><br><b><i>The cult of Maxine</i></b> <br>Maxine never officially joined the softball team but bought a jersey from Jill, cutting the collar to create a plunging V. She still wears it on occasion, even as the weather turns nippy. <br>Maxine towers over us in her medium heels. She makes us feel like hobbit-folk, with our stained teeth and ragamuffin outfits. With the exception of Laars, we have zero upper body strength. We are moderately proud of our youthful haircuts and overpriced rectangular eyeglasses but that&#x2019;s about it. <br>She smells great and we are all basically obsessed with her. It has to seriously stop, Lizzie says. Crease calls her aggressively hypnotic and can hardly bear to be within a twenty-yard radius. He sometimes crosses himself after she passes. <br><b><i>Her hair! </i></b>Jack II will e-mail, out of the blue. Everyone knows whose hair he&#x2019;s talking about. <br>Sharing an elevator ride alone with Maxine can be intensely disorienting. We try to avoid it. Several times of late, while waiting for the elevator at the end of the day, Crease has sensed Maxine&#x2019;s approach, her distinctive shoe-clack sending him darting in the other direction. In similar situations, Jenny has been known to mumble to herself, giving the impression that she&#x2019;s forgotten something at her desk. Jenny likes boys but sometimes when Maxine is in the room she&#x2019;s not so sure.<br> Laars says Maxine smells like the exquisite blossom of a rare hybrid fruit that you can only find at this one stall in a market in Kuala Lumpur. <br>The worst is when you turn the corner and you see her and you want to say Hi in a normal way but all that happens is your mouth opens and you make a little croaking sound or make no noise at all. It was Jules, no longer among us, who first identified this phenomenon. <br>There is so much to take in. Not just her clothes or lack of clothes, not just her amazing hair, but her entire philosophy of being. You can detect an aspect of the beauty queen in her looks and high-gloss appearance, her attention-yanking laugh and borderline moronic statements. But Pru has argued, in the landmark case Pru v. Jonah, that she&#x2019;s not only not stupid but definitely more accomplished than the rest of us. We don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s on that rï¿½sumï¿½, but it doesn&#x2019;t matter&#x2014;she&#x2019;s got that magic, that spark, utterly unclouded by self-doubt. <br>Maxine is on a different track than the rest of us. She entered the office at a higher level and we&#x2019;ll never catch up. By the time we reach her current position&#x2014;in the event we haven&#x2019;t burned out, drifted away&#x2014;she&#x2019;ll have scaled even greater heights, afloat on a cloud of boundless confidence and even more tantalizing scents. All of this should be illustrated in the manner of a medieval vision of the afterlife. <br><br><b><i>Lizzie is lying</i></b> <br>Empirically speaking, Maxine&#x2019;s not so hot, according to Lizzie, the nicest of us. This is what passes for dissent in our little group. I seriously don&#x2019;t see the appeal. <br>In time Lizzie comes to share our fascination, albeit in a different way. For Lizzie what&#x2019;s interesting is the phenomenon of Maxine worship, rather than her actual qualities. She compares it to when we all obsessed over that reality show in which ambitious people our age backstabbed and slept with each other in order to become chefs at an exclusive French restaurant, and then the restaurant turned out not to exist. <br><br><b><i>Let&#x2019;s not and say we did</i></b> <br>Maxine&#x2019;s latest e-mail bears the subject line Let&#x2019;s Talk About SEX. <br><i>No</i>, moans Pru, dreading yet another sexual-harassment seminar. We never had one before Maxine came to the company. The seminars produce the opposite of the intended effect, making us feel like sex maniacs, but at least they&#x2019;re better than the mental health seminars the Sprout used to hold. Those made us depressed, even violent&#x2014;Laars once punched the wall by the bulletin board so hard that his hand has never been the same. He blames this injury for his subpar softball performance. <br>Today Maxine makes wanton eye contact with the seminar leader, a lawyer named George. She&#x2019;s wearing a sheer shirt known commonly as that shirt. Pru knows the brand and everything. <br>George looks like he&#x2019;s just come back from vacation and is about to go on another one. His relaxed manner is exhausting to contemplate. All of us secretly wonder why we didn&#x2019;t go to law school, and also whether it&#x2019;s too late. <br>It is. <br>The gist of the meeting is that you should never date anyone in the office, ever. You should also be extremely careful about what you say to someone of the opposite or indeed the same sex. Many seemingly harmless sentences, phrases, even words, and actually individual letters can be construed as harassing. Never say anything about what somebody&#x2019;s wearing. Also, just to be safe, don&#x2019;t wear anything too revealing. <br>We all frown and gaze at Maxine in her flesh-colored mesh number. The hypocrisy, the everything, is too much. <br>Jonah says,<i> Don&#x2019;t we need eros in order for commerce to happen? </i>in that affected pensive tone he sometimes adopts, a pause every two words. <br>Do we? Admittedly, it&#x2019;s a stumper. None of us really knows. He sits up straight, strokes his chin in agitation. The tips of his ears go scarlet with rage. He should have been a philosophy professor or a union organizer for sooty paperboys. He says that, by the logic of the seminar, the subject line of Maxine&#x2019;s e-mail constitutes sexual harassment of sorts. He slaps the table&#x2014;case closed! <br>The rest of us don&#x2019;t say anything, partly because we&#x2019;re afraid the Sprout is taking notes and will fire us, but mostly because we are getting hungry and have lost the will to fight. Usually at these meetings there&#x2019;s a stack of sandwiches and coffee&#x2014;what the Sprout would call a carrot&#x2014;and sometimes actual, literal carrots. But not today. Lizzie nudges Pru. The Sprout is in the corner, eyes narrowed in concentration, chin planted in chest. Jonah&#x2019;s remarks have sent him deep into thought, so deep that he&#x2019;s actually sleeping. <br><br><b><i>The outside world </i></b><br>As we&#x2019;re filing out, George, the lawyer, asks Maxine, Grab lunch? <br>Just like that. <br>Two words. <br>She beams at the prospect. Our jaws fall off their hinges and Crease mimes shooting himself in the head. <br>Lizzie goes foraging for Claritin and Red Bull. Does anyone want anything from the outside world? she asks. <br>On the way to the drugstore she spies George and Maxine sliding into his car, a silver BMW. <br>Maxine is gone for the rest of the day. We have all been monitoring the situation intently. Laars says something critical of BMWs, German engineering, the legal profession as a whole. Laars rides his bike to work when he can. Today he wears a faded long-sleeved T advertising a New Jersey swimming pool company, the white letters nearly washed away, a recent flea market find. What could Maxine possibly see in George? Pru points out that George wears a clean shirt, the kind with buttons. <br><br><b><i>Us/them</i></b> <br>Is Maxine one of us? One of them? For the first few months we were under the misapprehension that she was someone&#x2019;s secretary, but then we started getting memos from her, some with a distinctly shape-up/ship-out undercurrent. <br>She might even outrank the Sprout. The subject merits closer, more fanatical observation. Could it be that the Sprout reports to her? <br>Pru tells us how all of the Sprout&#x2019;s issues about working for such a practically mythological creature as Maxine get inflicted on us. His lust for her leads to his hatred of us, roughly. His fear of her makes him want us to fear him. <br>As Pru talks, she flowcharts it on a pad, little multidirectional arrows and FEAR in huge letters. <br><br><b><i>The cc game</i></b> <br>Against the advisement of George, Maxine will sometimes compliment us on our hair or other aspects of our scruffy appearance. The next day, or even later the same day, she&#x2019;ll send an all-caps e-mail asking why a certain form is not on her desk. This will prompt a peppy reply, one barely stifling a howl of fear: <br><br>Hey Maxine! <br>The document you want was actually put in your in-box yesterday around lunchtime. I also e-mailed it to you and Russell. Let me know if you can&#x2019;t find it! <br>Thanks! <br>Laars <br><br>P.S. I&#x2019;m also attaching it again as a Word doc, just in case. <br><br>There&#x2019;s so much wrong here: the fake-vague around lunchtime, the nonsensical Thanks, the quasi-casual postscript. The exclamation points look downright psychotic. Laars plays what he calls the cc game, sending the e-mail to the Sprout as well. You should always rope in an outside witness in order to prove your competence or innocence. On the other hand, this could be seen as whining. <br>Maxine never writes back. The Sprout will not get around to Laars&#x2019;s e-mail for a week. He doesn&#x2019;t like to deal with the petty stuff, though it could also be argued that he doesn&#x2019;t like to deal with the big stuff, either. <br>He will study the e-mail for a few seconds, frown, and then delete it.</p><h2>The High Druid&#39;s Blade: The Defenders of Shannara</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER</b><br><br>Legend has it that Paxon Leah is descended from the royals and warriors who once ruled the Highlands and waged war with magical weapons.

But his formidable new ability is dangerous in untrained hands, and Paxon must master it quickly because his nearly fatal clash with the dark sorcerer Arcannen won&#x2019;t be his last.

The Highlands were called Leah, too, and the confusion sometimes caused outlanders to wonder if the inhabitants were limited to a single name for everything. It was worse in his case, since his surname was Leah, as well, passed down through countless generations from the rulers of old, for whom the city and the Highlands had been named when the Leahs were their Kings and Queens.<br><br>But all that was long ago and far away, and it had little to do with him. He might be the descendant of those Kings and Queens, but that and a few coins would buy you a tankard of ale at the Two Roosters tavern. There hadn&#x2019;t been a monarchy in Leah for generations; the last members of the royal family had walked away from the responsibility not long after Menion Leah had helped dispatch the Warlock Lord by finding and employing the fabled Sword of Shannara. Vague history, long forgotten by many, it was a legacy he carried lightly and with little regard.<br><br>He chopped another dozen pieces of firewood for the winter stash before pausing again. The Leahs were commoners now, no different from anyone else. They hadn&#x2019;t even served on the Highlands Council, the current governing body, for many years. His parents had inherited the shipping business that had been in the family for half a dozen generations&#x2014;a once-thriving but now marginal source of income and sustenance, operated by his mother and himself, but mostly by himself. He ran shipments on the average of twice a month, making just enough money to feed and clothe the family&#x2014;the family consisting of himself, his mother, and his little sister, Chrysallin. His father had been gone since he was ten, killed in an airship accident while flying freight into the Eastland.<br><br>He finished cutting up the firewood, stacking it by the storage shed next to their cottage, still pausing now and then to take in the view and dream of better times to come. Not that things were bad. He had time to hunt and fish, and he didn&#x2019;t work all that hard&#x2014;though he would have preferred the harder work if the business would improve. At twenty, he was tall and lean and broad-shouldered, his hair red in the tradition of his ancestors. There had been hundreds of redheaded Leahs over the years; he was just the latest. And he imagined there would be hundreds more before the line was played out.<br><br>With the wood neatly stacked, he carried his tools into the shed, cleaned and oiled the saws and ax heads, and went into the house to wash up. It was a small cottage with a kitchen, a central living space, and bedrooms for his mother, his sister, and himself. There was a fireplace, with windows to the west-facing front and to the south so there was always plenty of light&#x2014;important in a climate where the days were frequently gray and hazy.<br><br>He glanced at the old sword his sister had hung over the mantel above the hearth, its metal blade, leather pommel, and strap-on sheath all as black as night. Chrys had found it in the attic and proclaimed it hers. The markings on the weapon indicated that the pommel leather and sheath had been replaced more than once, but the metal blade was the original. She said it had belonged to those Leahs of old who had gone on quests with the Ohmsfords and the Druids, all the way back to Menion Leah and forward to their great-grandmother Mirai. Paxon supposed it was so; he had been told the stories often enough as a boy by both his father and his mother. Even some of their friends knew the tales, which had taken on the trappings of legend over the years.<br><br>He washed his hands and face in the kitchen sink, pumping water from their well, dried himself, and walked back into the living area to stand before the fireplace. The tales about that black sword were cautionary, whispering of dark magic and great power. It was said the blade had been tempered in the waters of the Hadeshorn once, long ago, and thereby made strong enough that it could cut through magic. A handful of Leahs were said to have carried it into battle with the Druids. A handful were said to have evoked its power.<br><br>He had tried to join their ranks more than once when he was much smaller, intent on discovering if the stories were true. Apparently, they weren&#x2019;t. All of his efforts to make the magic appear&#x2014;to make the sword do anything, for that matter&#x2014;had failed. There might have been more to the process, but the blade didn&#x2019;t come with instructions, and so after numerous attempts he had given up. What need did he have of magic, in any case? It wasn&#x2019;t as if he were going on a quest with Druids and Ohmsfords.<br><br>If there even were any Ohmsfords these days.<br><br>There was some doubt about this. All of the Ohmsfords had left Patch Run&#x2014;their traditional home for hundreds of years&#x2014;when his great-grandmother had married Railing Ohmsford and brought him to the Highlands to live. His brother, Redden, had come with them, and for a time had shared their home. But eventually he had found a girl to fall in love with and had married her and moved out. Both Redden and Railing had stayed in the Highlands until they died, twins closer than brothers to the end. Redden&#x2019;s boys had moved away and no more had been heard of them. Railing&#x2019;s granddaughter, always closer to her grandmother&#x2019;s side of the family, had taken back the Leah name when she married and had eventually passed it down to her children.<br><br>Since then, there had been no Ohmsfords in the Highlands, only Leahs, and Paxon couldn&#x2019;t say if there were Ohmsfords to be found anywhere in the Four Lands these days. Certainly, he hadn&#x2019;t heard mention of any. Which was sad, considering that the families had been friends over many, many years, and the relationships had been close and personal, including most recently the marriage of his great-grandmother to Railing.<br><br>But everything comes to an end, even friendships, and families die out or move on, so you couldn&#x2019;t expect that nothing would ever change.<br><br>The Ohmsfords had possessed real magic, inherited over the years as a part of their makeup&#x2014;a power born of Elven magic that had come to be known as the wishsong. Redden and Railing Ohmsford had both had use of it&#x2014;though it had skipped other generations previously, and every generation since Railing&#x2019;s marriage to Mirai Leah. None of the offspring from that union and for the three generations following had possessed the wishsong magic, so for them&#x2014;as for him&#x2014;it was another slice of history that was interesting to talk about, but of little practical consequence.<br><br>Besides, he wasn&#x2019;t so certain that having use of such magic wouldn&#x2019;t be more of a burden than a gift. He had heard the stories of what using it had done to the twins, particularly Redden, who had been rendered catatonic after employing it in the terrible struggle against the creatures of the Forbidding. He had recovered, but his brother and Mirai had feared he wouldn&#x2019;t. All magic was dangerous, and any use involved a certain amount of risk. It didn&#x2019;t matter if it was something you were born with or not&#x2014;it still posed a threat.<br><br>Which was in large part why magic was outlawed all through the Southland&#x2014;everywhere the Federation was in control, which these days included everything south of the Rainbow Lake, including Leah. The northern territories didn&#x2019;t feel the Federation presence as heavily as did the major Southland cities, and in truth Leah and the villages of the Duln were still disputed territories, with the Borderlands laying claim to them as well. But no one wanted to risk bringing the Federation authorities down on their heads by testing out their tolerance for those using magic in deliberate defiance of the edict&#x2014;especially when the prevailing view in the Highlands was that magic was a source of power best left to the Druids, or left alone entirely.<br><br>Paxon studied the sword and scabbard a moment longer, then turned away. A relic, an artifact, or his sister&#x2019;s momentary infatuation&#x2014;what difference did it make? It was nothing to him.<br><br>He went back outside and glanced at the sky. A few clouds were moving in, but nothing threatening. Still time to work on those radian draws he had been mending for the transport. He had a run to make the following week, and he wanted the airship to be fully operational well before then. He was thinking Chrys should go with him. It was time she began taking an active interest in the business. Still only fifteen, she was wild and impetuous, just beginning to recognize her lack of interest in authority and fully engaged in finding out how much trouble she could get into. At least, that was what he perceived. His mother was more tolerant, seeing Chrys as a young girl growing up and still finding herself, while Paxon saw her as trouble on the prowl.<br><br>Like the time she found a way to haul the Radanians&#x2019; tractor onto their barn roof. Or the time she put twenty live pigs in the butcher&#x2019;s bedroom. Or the time she and three others went down to a council meeting to protest involvement with an irrigation plan that potentially would have dammed up the Borgine River and killed thousands of fish, dumping vats full of dead fish on the chamber floor to emphasize their point.<br><br>Or all the times she stayed out all night with boys. Or the times she came home from the Two Roosters walking sideways and singing bawdy Highland drinking songs.<br><br>His sister needed something to focus on besides finding new and creative ways to entertain herself, and it was time she began contributing more than housecleaning and dishwashing to the family effort. She already knew a sufficient amount about flying airships to help him on his runs, and eventually she would be old enough and might become sufficiently dependable to make runs on her own. In the meantime, she could learn to fly the transport and lend a hand with crewing.<br><br>Maybe that would help keep her out of the Two Roosters and similar drinking holes, where she already spent far too much time.<br><br>He walked back into the kitchen and began looking through the cold box and pantry. His mother had gone to her sister&#x2019;s house for a few days, helping with the new baby. So it would be up to him to make dinner for himself and Chrys&#x2014;assuming his sister put in an appearance. These days, it was no sure thing. He worried for her, and it frustrated him that she paid him so little attention.<br><br>You aren&#x2019;t my parent, she would say. You can&#x2019;t tell me what to do. Aggravating.<br><br>Sometimes, he wished their father were still there. Chrys had grown up too fast and too independent without him there to help rein her in. Maybe he could have exercised better control over her than Paxon.<br><br>He shook his head doubtfully. As if anyone could control Chrysallin.<br><br>He left the kitchen with a glass of ale and went out to sit on the porch rocker. Maybe he would have to go looking for her, bring her back to share dinner. He didn&#x2019;t like eating alone. He didn&#x2019;t like eating while worrying about her. It was bad enough that he had to do everything when their mother was away. Chrys didn&#x2019;t seem to think she had any responsibilities at all. She acted like she could do what she wanted and that ought to be the way of things.<br><br>She acted like a child, he thought, fuming. She acted like no one mattered but her.<br><br>But she was a child, of course. She was fifteen&#x2014;and when you were a fifteen-year-old girl, no one else mattered but yourself.<br><br>She had a good heart; he would concede that. She was kind to others, especially to those in need of kindness and less fortunate than she was. She was quick to lend out or even give away what she had to those who didn&#x2019;t. She could be your friend in a heartbeat, if she saw you wished it. She stood up for what she believed in. She would not back down or be intimidated. His memories of her growing up softened his momentary frustration. She would get back to who she had been; he was sure of it. She would be all right in the end.<br><br>He finished off the ale and took the empty tankard back into the kitchen. He should go down to the airfield and work on mending those radian draws, he thought for the second time in the last few minutes. He should forget about Chrys and dinner until the day was a little farther along. Worrying about the future seldom did anything to help improve it. If you wanted to do something about the future, you had to put some effort into it. That usually involved working on something that would make the future you sought more attainable.<br><br>As he was going out the door, he glanced once more at the ancient sword above the fireplace. It&#x2019;d be nice if you could make things better just by using magic. If you could skip the work part. Even if you could only do it once.<br><br>Staring at the sword, he wondered suddenly if his life was going in the right direction. He was flying freight on airships because his father had. He was running the family business because he was the oldest, and if he didn&#x2019;t do it no one would and his mother would have to sell. But was this what he really wanted to do? Or was he just marking time, doing what was easiest, taking on the familiar and not risking anything?<br><br>The front door flew open.<br><br>&#x201c;Paxon!&#x201d;<br><br>He turned around to find Jayet, one of the serving girls at the Two Roosters, standing in the entryway, looking distraught. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; he asked quickly.<br><br>&#x201c;Your sister!&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s wrong. You&#x2019;d better come right away!&#x201d;<br><br>Chrys. Of course it would be Chrys.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t argue with Jayet. He just did what she asked and went out the door behind her, working hard at keeping up because she was striding ahead so quickly.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s she done now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gotten herself in trouble. What do you think?&#x201d;<br><br>Jayet was small and tough, physically compact, emotionally cool, and a bulldog at everything she did, which made her perfect for working at the tavern. She was Chrys&#x2019;s friend&#x2014;or as much of a friend as anyone could be to his sister&#x2014;always there when it mattered, ready to keep Chrys from getting in too deep with whatever mad scheme or stunt she had taken it into her head to try out.<br><br>Her mop of spiky white-blond hair bounced as she glanced over her shoulder at Paxon. &#x201c;She got into a dice game. There were five of them, all locals except for this one man, who claims to have flown in on business from the Southland cities. Doesn&#x2019;t look like a businessman, but who knows? Anyway, I&#x2019;m not paying much attention to them. No one&#x2019;s causing any trouble&#x2014;Chrys included&#x2014;when all of a sudden she leaps up and starts screaming at him. Just screaming like she can&#x2019;t stand to be in the same room with him.&#x201d;</p><h2>Weather: An Illustrated History: From Cloud Atlases to Climate Change (Union Square &amp; Co.

That's the message of this eighteenth-century inspirational classic by a French Jesuit writer. The Reverend Jean-Pierre de Caussade (1675&#x2013;1751) encouraged others to "live in the moment," accepting everyday obstacles with humility and love.<br>Caussade's counsel, which promises comfort and holiness to every soul with good will, has guided generations of seekers to spiritual peace. Some of his advice is particularly relevant to beginners; other teachings are geared to those possessing a more advanced degree of spirituality. All will recognize the voice of an authority, who combines practical and theoretical knowledge. Modern readers will find this volume a path to peace amid life's worries and anxieties.</p><p>For more than 250 years, this simple classic of inspiration has guided readers of all faiths to the open-hearted acceptance of God&#39;s will that is the sure path to serenity, happiness, and spiritual peace.Father Jean-Pierre de Caussade was born at Cahors, France in 1675. He is commonly recognized for his instructional letters to the Nuns of the Visitation, whom he served as a spiritual director for seven years. In addition, he spent some time preaching in southern and central France, as well as serving as a theological student director in Toulouse. Jean-Pierre also served as a college rector.

From the 1930s through the present day, his writings have been shaping the international literary consciousness. <p><i>The Space of Literature</i>, first published in France in 1955, is central to the development of Blanchot's thought. In it he reflects on literature and the unique demand it makes upon our attention. Thus he explores the process of reading as well as the nature of artistic creativity, all the while considering the relation of the literary work to time, to history, and to death. This book consists not so much in the application of a critical method or the demonstration of a theory of literature as in a patiently deliberate meditation upon the literary experience, informed most notably by studies of Mallarmï¿½, Kafka, Rilke, and Hï¿½lderlin. Blanchot's discussions of those writers are among the finest in any language.</p></p><p>The Space of Literature, first published in France in 1955, is central to the development of Blanchot&#39;s thought.

Juxtaposed with meditations on the nature of violence and exile in a noirish New York at the end of the 20th century, these themes force us to confront the gritty injustices of our real world, making them as evident as the grime and desperation that pervade traditional detective fiction. <br><br>Alack Sinner stories play out against a jazz soundtrack, beginning in 1975 and running through the 2000s. The authors have rearranged the stories by series chronology, rather than date of publication, providing a novel reading experience for fans both new and old. <br><br><i>The Age of Disenchantment </i>presents eleven stories, including "Nicaragua," "Private Stories," "The USA Affair," and "The End of the Road."</p><p><b>Carlos Sampayo</b> is an Argentine writer best known for his work in comics, particularly in collaboration with artist Josï¿½ Muï¿½oz. Sampayo met Muï¿½oz in Spain after he fled from the military junta. They created 'Joe's Bar' (short stories about clients of a cafï¿½ in New York), 'Alack Sinner' (a hard-boiled detective in the style of film-noir), 'Jeu de Lumiï¿½res', 'Billie Holiday' and other stories. Sampayo also worked with Oscar Zarate, Jorge Schiaffino and Solano Lï¿½pez.<br><br>Born in 1942 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as a child <b>Jose Muï¿½oz</b> manifested a great passion for design, and a particular interest in the world of comics. He emerged as an independent artist in 1963 with his detective series "Precinct 56". In 1974 he met the Argentine writer Carlos Sampayo and this fundamental event would mark the beginning of a long and fruitful collaboration. Thus the character of Alack Sinner was born--a private detective whose human adventures were played out to the sound of jazz, and whose stories described both the misery and nobility of a New York that was imagined in such a way that it could almost have been real.&#x201c;One of the 100 great comics of the last 20th Century and one of the ten all-time best drawn, [when] IDW does bring us a complete edition of Jose Munoz and Carlos Sampayo&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Alack</i>&nbsp;<i>Sinner</i>, that will be a line drawn across the page at or near the top on the &#x2018;missing comics editions&#x2019; list in this golden age of reprints.

Through intensive work, Steiner&#x2019;s unique meditations will lead to a greater feeling of unity with the surrounding world. <br><br> This budget-priced pocket version features Owen Barfield&#x2019;s pioneering translation&#x2015; &#x201c;paraphrased for an English ear&#x201d; &#x2015;based on more than fifty years studying this text. As Barfield asserts, no simple translation can convey the real thrust of these verses. Because of this, he tries to &#x201c;suggest&#x201d; rather than simply reproduce the original in exact English translations. <br><br> <i>The Calendar of the Soul</i> is a translation of &#x201c;Anthroposophischer Seelenkalender,&#x201d; included in <i>Wahrspruchworte</i> (GA 40).</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.WINTER: <p>To carry spirit light into the world-winter-night / My heart is ardently impelled, / That shining seeds of soul / Take root in grounds of worlds / And Word Divine through senses' darkness / Resounds, transfiguring all life. </p><p>SUMMER </p><p>To bear in inward keeping spirit bounty / Is stern command of my prophetic feeling, / That ripened gifts divine / Maturing in the depths of soul / To selfhood bring their fruits.</p></p><h2>Walking the Road to Freedom: A Story about Sojourner Truth (Creative Minds Biographies)</h2><p><p>Sojourner Truth was born into slavery in New York in 1797 or 1798.

She specializes in biographies of people from 1776 to 1936 who overcame difficulties or discrimination or worse, to do great and important deeds for America. Many of her books are about multicultural heroes who, until recently, have been sadly omitted from history. Others are about important people you may not know, yet. For example - Noah Webster! NOAH WEBSTER &amp; HIS WORDS, Houghton Mifflin Books for Children, is an SCBWI Golden Kite Award winner for best nonfiction book of 2012. Her books have won lots of other awards too (see www.jerichaseferris.com).<br><br>Jeri retired from a happy 30-year teaching career several years ago in order to write full time. As a history major, Jeri loves the research process (easier than actually writing!) and she travels all over the world to research and collect information on her subjects. She is currently completing a historical fiction for young adults set in Leningrad, USSR (now St. Petersburg, Russia) during the 900-day Siege in WWII. This book, SURROUNDED: THE NAZI NOOSE, comes from her passion for Russia and its history, culture, and people, and her desire to convey the unimaginable experiences of the people and youth of 1941 Leningrad to American young people and adults.&nbsp;<br><br>When she's not writing or traveling or researching or reading, Jeri is probably riding her big sorrel rescue horse Pamyat ("to remember" in Russian), or dancing, or acting, or singing, or playing with her Scottie dog Nasha ("ours" in Russian). Or she might be studying Russian (one of these days she'll get it), or working on her blog or her newspaper column. Speaking of riding, when Jeri was demonstrating her horseback riding skills at the Nebraska State Fair some years ago, she fell off her horse and broke her arm in front of the whole crowd. (One of these days she'll get it.)</p></p><h2>An Outlaw&#39;s Christmas (The McKettricks, N/A)</h2><p>Celebrate the holidays with this remarkable McKettrick tale by beloved #1 New York Times bestselling author &nbsp;Linda Lael Miller&nbsp;<br><br>With his wild heart, Sawyer McKettrick isn't ready to settle down on the Triple M family ranch in Arizona. So he heads to Blue River, Texas, to seek a job as marshal. But in a blinding snowstorm, he's injured&#x2014;and collapses into the arms of a prim and proper lady in calico.&nbsp;<br><br>The shirtless, bandaged stranger recuperating in teacher Piper St. James's room behind the schoolhouse says he's a McKettrick, but he looks like an outlaw to her. As they wait out the storm, the handsome loner has Piper remembering long-ago dreams of marriage and motherhood. But for how long is Sawyer willing to call Blue River home?&nbsp;<br><br>As the gray skies clear, Piper's one holiday wish just might bring two lonely hearts together forever.</p><p><b>Linda LaelMiller</b> is a #1&nbsp;<i>New YorkTimes</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>USA TODAY </i>bestselling author of morethan&nbsp;one hundred&nbsp; novels. Long passionate about the Civil War buff, she has studied theera avidly and has&nbsp;made many visits to Gettysburg,&nbsp; where she has witnessedreenactments of the legendary clash between North and South. Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i><br><br><em>December, 1915</em><br><br>All but hidden behind a rapidly thickening veil of snow that cold afternoon, Blue River, Texas, looked more like a faint pencil sketch against a gray-and-white background than a real town, constructed of beams and mortar and weathered wood and occupied by flesh-and-blood folks. Squinting against the dense flurries, Sawyer Mc-Kettrick could just make out the pitch of a roof or two, the mounded lines of hitching rails and horse troughs, the crooked jut of the occasional chimney. Here and there, the light of a lamp or lantern glowed through the gloom, but as far as Sawyer could tell, nobody was stirring along the sidewalks or traveling the single wide street curving away from the tiny railroad depot.<br><br>Beside him, his buckskin gelding, Cherokee, nickered and tossed his big head, no doubt relieved to finally plant four sturdy hooves on solid ground after long hours spent rattling over the rails in a livestock car. Sawyer's own journey, sitting bolt upright on a hard and sooty seat in the near-empty passenger section, had been so dull and so uncomfortable that he probably would have been happier riding with the horse.<br><br>Naturally, Cherokee didn't hold up his end of a conversation, but he was a fine listener and a trustworthy companion.<br><br>Now, the engineer's whistle sounded a long, plaintive hoot of fare-thee-well behind them, and the train clanked slowly out of the station, iron screeching against iron, steam hissing into the freezing air.<br><br>They waited, man and horse, until the sounds grew muffled and distant, though for what, Sawyer couldn't have said. He hadn't expected to be met at the depot&#x2014; Clay McKettrick, his cousin and closest friend, lived on a ranch several miles outside of Blue River and, given the weather, the trail winding between there and town must be nigh on impassable&#x2014;but just the same, a momentary sense of loneliness howled through him like a wind scouring the walls of a canyon.<br><br>With a glance back at the station, where he'd left his trunk of belongings behind, meaning to fetch it later, Sawyer swung up into the saddle and spoke a gruff, soothing word of encouragement to the horse.<br><br>There was a hotel in Blue River&#x2014;he'd stayed there on his last visit&#x2014;but he wanted to let Cherokee walk off some stiffness before settling him in over at the livery stable with plenty of hay and a ration of grain, and then making his way back to rent a room. Once he'd secured a bed for the night, he'd send somebody for his trunk, consume a steak dinner in the hotel dining room, and, later on, take a bath and shave.<br><br>In the meantime, though, he wanted to attend to his horse. Sawyer gave the animal his head, let him forge his own way, at his own pace, through the deep snow and the unnerving silence.<br><br>The buildings on either side of the street were visible as they passed, though only partially, dark at the windows, with their doors shut tight. Most folks were where they ought to be, Sawyer supposed, gathered around stoves and fireplaces in their various homes, with coffee brewed and supper smells all around them.<br><br>Again, that bleak feeling of aloneness rose up inside him, but he quelled it quickly. He did not subscribe to melancholy moods&#x2014;it wasn't the McKettrick way. In his family, a man&#x2014;or a woman, for that matter&#x2014;played the cards they were dealt, kept on going no matter what, and tended, to the best of their ability, to whatever task was presently at hand.<br><br>Still, there was a prickle at his nape, and Cherokee, rarely skittish, pranced sideways in agitation, tossing his head and neighing.<br><br>Sawyer had barely pushed back his long coat to uncover his Colt .45, just in case, when he heard the gunshot, swaddled in the snowy silence to a muted pop, saw the flash of orange fire and felt the bullet sear its way into his left shoulder. All of this transpired in the course of a second or so, but even as he slumped forward over Cherokee's neck, dazed by the hot-poker thrust of the pain, spaces wedged themselves between moments, stretching time, distorting it. Sawyer was at once a wounded man, alone on a snow-blind street except for his panicked horse, and a dispassionate observer, nearby but oddly detached from the scene.<br><br>He didn't see the shooter or his horse, but the calm, watching part of him sized up the situation, sensed there had been a rider. If anybody had seen anything, or heard the muffled gunshot, they weren't fixing to rush to his rescue, and he didn't have the strength to draw his .45, even if he could have seen beyond Cherokee's laid-back ears.<br><br>Fortunately, the horse knew that&#x2014;in cases like this anyway&#x2014;discretion was the better part of valor. Cherokee bolted for safer territory, leapfrogging through the powdery snow, and Sawyer, hurting bad and only half-conscious, simply lay over the pommel, with the saddle horn jabbing into his middle like a fist, and held on to reins and mane for all he was worth.<br><br>Maybe the gunman lost sight of them in the storm, or maybe he just slipped back through the edges of Sawyer's awareness, into the pulsing darkness that surrounded him, but the second shot, the one that would have finished him off for sure, never came.<br><br>His mind slowed, and then slowed some more. He was aware of the <em>thud-thud-thud</em> of his heart, the raspy scratch of his breath, clawing its way into his lungs and then out again, and the familiar smell of wet horsehide, but his vision dimmed to a gray haze.<br><br>Cherokee kept moving. Sawyer's consciousness seemed to retreat into the far corners of his mind, but growing up on the Triple M Ranch in Arizona, he'd practically been raised on the back of a horse, and the muscles in his arms and legs must have drawn on some capacity for recollection beyond the grasp of the waking mind, because he managed to stay in the saddle.<br><br>It was only when the horse came to a sudden stop in a spill of buttery light on glistening snow that Sawyer pitched sideways with a sickening lurch, jarred his wounded shoulder when he struck the snow-padded ground, and passed out from the pain.<br><br>Piper St. James, seated at the desk in her empty schoolroom and glumly surveying the scrawny, undecorated pine tree leaning against the far wall, wished heartily, and not for the first time, that she'd never left Maine to strike out for a life of adventure in the still-wild West.<br><br>Her cousin Dara Rose, in love with her handsome rancher husband, had painted a fine picture of Blue River in her letters, telling Piper what a wonderful place it was, full of good people and wide-open to newcomers.<br><br>Piper sighed. Of course Dara Rose would see things that way&#x2014;she was so happy in her new marriage and, being a generous soul, she wanted Piper to be happy, too. Life had been hard for her cousin and her two little girls, but Clay McKettrick had changed all that.<br><br>Piper's pupils&#x2014;all thirteen of them&#x2014;were safe at home, where they belonged, and that was a considerable comfort to her. She'd spent the entire day alone, though, shut up in the schoolhouse, feeding the potbellied stove from an ever-dwindling store of firewood, keeping herself occupied as best she could. Tomorrow was likely to bring more of the same, since the storm showed no signs of letting up&#x2014;it might even get worse.<br><br>Piper shuddered at the thought. She had plenty of food, thanks to the good people of Blue River, but her supply of well water was running out fast, like the wood. Soon, she'd have no choice but to pull on a pair of oversize boots, bundle up in both her everyday shawls <em>and</em> her heavy woolen cloak, raise the hood to protect her ears from the stinging chill, and slog her way across the school yard, once to the woodshed, and once to the well. To make matters worse, she was getting low on kerosene for the one lamp she'd allowed herself to light.<br><br>She told herself that Clay, Dara Rose's husband, would come by to check on her soon, but there was no telling when or if he'd be able to get there, given the distance and the state of the roads. For now, Piper had to do for herself.<br><br>The wind howled around the clapboard walls of that small, unpainted schoolhouse, sorrowful as a whole band of banshees searching for a way in, making her want to burrow under the quilts on her bed, which took up most of the tiny room in back set aside for teacher's quarters, and hide there until the weather turned.<br><br>She might freeze if she did that, of course, and that was if she didn't die of thirst beforehand.<br><br>So she put on the ungainly boots, left behind by Miss Krenshaw, the last teacher, wrapped herself in wool, drew a deep breath and opened the schoolhouse door to step out onto the little porch.<br><br>The cold buffeted her, hard as a slap, trapping the breath in her lungs and nearly knocking her backward, over the threshold.<br><br>Resolute, she drew the shawls and the cloak more tightly around her and tried again. The sooner she went out, the sooner she could come back <em>in,</em> she reasoned.<br><br>She stopped on the schoolhouse porch, peering through the goose-feather flakes coming down solid as a wall in front of her. Was that a horse, there in the thin light her one lamp cast through the front window?<br><br>Piper caught her breath, her heart thudding with sudden hope. There <em>was</em> a horse, and a horse meant a rider, and a rider meant company, if not practical help. Perhaps Clay <em>had</em> braved the tempest to pay her a visit&#x2014;<br><br>She trudged down the steps and across the yard, every step an effort, and got a clearer look at the horse. A sturdy buckskin, the animal was real, all right. The creature was saddled, reins dangling, and she saw its eyes roll upward, glaring white.<br><br>But there was no rider on its back.<br><br>Although Piper had little experience with horses, she felt an instant affinity for the poor thing, evidently lost in the storm. It must have wandered off from somewhere nearby.<br><br>She moved toward it slowly, carefully, partly because of the bitter wind and partly because of her own rising trepidation. She didn't recognize the horse, which meant that Clay <em>hadn't</em> come to look in on her, nor had any of the other men&#x2014;fathers, brothers or uncles of her students&#x2014;who might have been concerned about the schoolmarm's welfare.<br><br>The buckskin whinnied wildly as she approached, backing up awkwardly, nearly falling onto its great, heaving haunches, lathered despite the chill.<br><br>"There, now," Piper said, reaching for the critter's bridle strap. There was a shed behind the schoolhouse&#x2014;some of the students rode in from the country when class was in session and tethered their mounts there for the day, so there was some hay, and the plank walls offered a modicum of shelter&#x2014;but just then, that shack seemed as far away as darkest Africa.<br><br>Before she could take hold of the horse's bridle, Piper tripped over something solid, half buried in the snow, fell to her hands and knees, and felt the sticky warmth of blood seeping through her mittens.<br><br>She saw him then, the rider, sprawled on his back, hat lying a few feet away, staining the snow to crimson.<br><br>Sitting on her haunches, Piper stared down at the unfortunate wayfarer for a few long moments, snowflakes slicing at her face like razors, confounded and afraid.<br><br>Bile surged into the back of her throat, scalding there, and she willed herself not to turn aside and retch. Something had to be done&#x2014;and quickly.<br><br>"Mister?" she called, gripping the lapels of his long gunslinger's coat and bending close to his face. "Mister, are you alive?"<br><br>He groaned, and she saw one of his eyelids twitch.<br><br>The horse, close enough to step on one or both of them, whinnied again, a desperate sound.<br><br>"You'll be all right," Piper told both the horse and the man, on her knees in the snow, her mittens and cloak damp with blood, but she wasn't at all sure that was the truth.<br><br>The man was around six feet tall&#x2014;there was no way she could lift him, and it was clear that he couldn't stand, let alone walk.<br><br>Piper deliberated briefly, then stumbled and struggled back into the schoolhouse, through to her room, and wrenched the patchwork quilt&#x2014;she'd done the piecework herself and the task had been arduous&#x2014;off the bed.<br><br>Warmer now, from the exertions of the past few minutes, Piper rushed outside again and somehow managed to get the quilt underneath the bleeding stranger. He opened his eyes once&#x2014;even in the dim light she could see that they were a startling shade of greenish azure&#x2014;and a little smile crooked the corner of his mouth before he passed into unconsciousness again.<br><br>In a frenzy of strength, she dragged man and quilt as far as the steps, but there was no getting him up them. She had no way of knowing how long he'd been lying in the school yard, injured, and frostbite was a serious possibility, as was hypothermia.<br><br>She gripped him by his shoulders&#x2014;they were broad under her hands, and hard with muscle&#x2014;and shook him firmly. "Mister!" she yelled, through the raging wind. "You've got to rally yourself enough to get up these steps&#x2014;I can't do this without some assistance, and there's no one else around!"<br><br>Miraculously, the stranger came to and gathered enough strength to half crawl up the steps, with a lot of help from Piper. From there, she was able to pull him over the threshold onto the rough-plank floor, where he lay facedown, bleeding copiously and only semiconscious.<br><br>"My horse," he rasped.<br><br>"Bother your horse," Piper replied, but she didn't mean it. The stranger, being a human being, was her first concern, but she was almost as worried about that frightened animal standing outside in the weather, and she knew she wouldn't be able to ignore it.<br><br><em>"Horse,"</em> the man repeated.<br><br>"I'll see to him," Piper promised, having no real choice in the matter. She collected another blanket from her quarters, covered the man, and steeled herself to hurry back outside.<br><br>Ever after, she'd wonder how she'd managed such an impossible feat, but at the time, Piper worked from a sense of expediency. She got ahold the horse's reins and somehow led him around back, through what seemed like miles of snow, and into the dark shed. There, she removed his saddle, the blanket beneath it, and the bridle. She spread out some hay for him and found a bucket, which she filled with snow&#x2014;that being the best she could do for now. When the snow melted, the creature would have drinking water.<br><br>The horse was jumpy at first, and Piper took a few precious moments to speak softly to him, rubbing him down as best she could with an old burlap sack and making the same promise as before&#x2014;he <em>would</em> be all right, and so would his master, because she wouldn't have it any other way.<br><br>On the way back to the schoolhouse, she fought her way into the woodshed and filled her arms with sticks of pitch-scented pine.<br><br>The stranger was still on the floor, upon her return, lying just over the threshold, either dead or sleeping.<br><br>Hastily, murmuring a prayer under her breath, Piper dumped the firewood into the box beside the stove, went back to the man, pulled off one ruined mitten and felt for a pulse at the base of his throat. His skin was cold, a shade of grayish-blue, but there was a heartbeat, thank heaven, faint but steady.<br><br>There was still water to fetch&#x2014;why hadn't she done this chore earlier, in the daylight, as she'd intended, instead of starting a pot of pinto beans and reading one of Sir Walter Scott's novels?&#x2014;and Piper didn't allow herself to think beyond getting to the well, filling a couple of buckets, and bringing them inside.<br><br></p><h2>Japanese Paper Embroidery</h2><p>Embroidery on paper is a traditional and well-loved craft, here artfully translated into beautiful and understated Japanese designs by Atsumi, Minako Chiba and Mari Kamio. These three talented Japanese crafters have created a range of delightful paper projects that are modern, stylish and fun to make. Each project is accompanied by a full-size template and notes on how to embroider the design, and there are clear and detailed instructions on the materials and tools you require; the essential technique of embroidering on paper; and eleven basic embroidery stitches that can be used individually or in combination to create all of the exquisite designs in the book. <br><br> Choose from a range of ideas that includes drawing, writing and more creative projects, including paper clocks, notebooks, envelopes, decorations, book marks and cards for all occasions. Suitable for those new to paper embroidery as well as more experienced crafters, this book will excite and inspire anyone with a love of Japanese style and clean, simple design.</p><p>After graduating from Tama Art University, a t s u m i worked with apparel and at the university while establishing herself as an embroidery artist. In 2009, she launched her own brand Itos.Embroidery on paper has been brought into the 21st century with this book. Modern, contemporary designs are combined with easy stitching techniques. Create useful projects with the templates and follow the instructions at the back of the book. This book is suitable for all skill levels. The book is split into three sections plus basic instructions. The sections are Drawing, Writing and creating with Paper Embroidery. Good photos and great projects. * Karen Platt- yarnsandfabrics.co.uk * Embroidery doesn't have to be on fabric, you can also do it on paper and card to make beautiful items like greetings cards, notebooks, table decorations and more. A few years ago embroidering greetings cards was a popular hobby with Holland being the main place the designs originated from. This is a different style that is very Japanese, combining an understated elegance with a sense of colorful fun and goes a lot further than just cards. The book is in three sections each in a different style by the three authors, complete with a short interview about inspiration and background. Here you can see all the items made up and displayed. Then comes a section about how to do it and what you need, and finally all the patterns. If you are familiar with the Dutch style of making holes and sewing up and down them this is not quite like that but more freestyle, or at least there are options for this. The "projects" are not laid out in the usual manner but exist as photographs in the relevant designer sections and then the patterns with their pointers on floss color, number of strands and stitch. Patterns are drawn in lines not dots and there are two pages of embroidery stitches to choose from so there is plenty of scope for customization. The stitch diagrams are clearly drawn and easy to follow, complete with a photograph of the finished stitches. Sweet bags, photo frames, place name cards, stationery, party ware and even a paper clock are some of the things you can make as well as cards, tags and tree decorations. There are abstract designs, names, numbers and letters, tiny motifs and messages, suitable both for new embroiderers and those with plenty of experience. A new twist on an old idea. * Rachel Hyde - Myshelf.com * As a follow-on to the colouring-books-for-grown-ups trend, can sewing cards be far behind? They're here - in the guise of this delightful new book, Japanese Paper Embroidery! The three authors are design professionals from Japan, where both papercraft and embroidery have long traditions. Endearingly, the book begins with a haiku about paper embroidery, to set the tone of creative enthusiasm and appreciation. The book contains 20 projects, appealing and imaginative designs that are not labour-intensive - the concept being to add a touch of handmade charm to everyday items. In addition to the expected cards, many of the projects are 3-D (beyond the dimesionality of the stitching itself). There are ideas for packaging food gifts, an entire paper embroidery party set (love the animal cup holders), and even a clock face. You will find stitched booklet spines - made of elegant, yet simple stitch patterns. There's an entire embroidered alphabet for monogramming purposes - cue the typography trend. (In case you were wondering, although this book was first published in Japan, all of the embroidered text is in English). Another fantastic idea is to revive 1950s-style embroidered postcards (you know - kitsch holiday cards with Spanish dancers, etc.)... adding stitched highlights to photos or printed designs. The book contains Q &amp; A interviews with the authors, finding out what drew them to embroidery on paper, and discussing fine points of the creative process. The instructional parts of the book are well done with photographic step-by-steps. You are taught how to transfer designs, then pierce the stitching holes. There is a section entitled "All About Embroidery Thread", which shows how to choose, use, and store it. There is also a spread illustrating the "Basic Stitches for Paper Embroidery" and suggestions on how to combine stitches to build designs - such as the very fashionable mandala-style design on the book's front cover. Back-of-book is a template section (not all full-size). The templates are helpfully annotated with how many strands of thread to use for the design lines, and with making-up tips. Although the actual process of transferring a design and then piercing stitching holes is fiddly, the paper embroidery is used sparingly so that the amount of work per design is reasonable. The concept of adding stitchery as a dimensional embellishment to papercraft projects is a winner. For papercrafters this book offers a pleasant introduction to a new way to add to your decorative skillset. * The Papercraft Post Blog * There's a long tradition of both paper craft and embroidery in Japan, and this delightful book cleverly brings these two together. There are interviews wirh each designer and photographs showcasing inspiring ideas for more than 20 projects - you won't be able to wait to get started! The back of the book features basic stitches for paper and also all the templates required. We think the concept of adding stitching as an embellishment to paper craft projects is a real winner. * Love to Make * Surface embroidery is most commonly used as an embellishment for cloth, but there are numerous traditions, both European and Asian, for embroidering on paper. The interplay of textures is fascinating, and paper embroidery allows crafters to embellish everyday objects such as file folders and notebooks, as well as special-occasion items including cards and ornaments. Japan-based artists Atsumi, Minako Chiba, and Mari Kamio present a variety of small projects showcasing the use of embroidery on an array of paper goods. As is typical with Japanese crafting books, the focus is more on the gallery of finished items than on the educational aspect of the book, and aside from a brief overview of supplies for paper embroidery and basic embroidery stitches, there isn't much direction provided. The traceable templates for the projects include stitch guides, allowing crafters to duplicate the authors' work; however, novice embroiderers may find themselves wishing they had more information about how to prepare the paper and form the stitches. VERDICT Stitching on paper is an easy way to get started with embroidery, and stitched embellishments are increasingly common in many kinds of paper crafts, including scrapbooking. But unless crafters are specifically interested in one of the projects in this collection, they'd be better served with an embroidery stitch reference, such as Search Press's A-Z of Embroidery Stitches. * Library Journal USA * This book is packed full of simple beautiful designs. It's amazing what can be done with thread and paper. The book is packed full of designs that can be used throughout the year. Not only are there are designs for cards there are also designs for gifts and wrapping. The book also provides you with what you need to know to design your own projects. The book makes it so simple to make the projects and create something magnificent. It truly is special what can be created. If you've never embroidered then I would highly recommend this book. If you do embroider then this is a different way you can use it to make new and interesting projects. The book is split into 5 sections; Drawing with Paper Embroidery, Writing with Paper Embroidery, Creating with Paper Embroidery, The Foundations of Paper Embroidery &amp; Templates. The first section covers everything from Birthday and Christmas cards to Notebooks. The 2nd section has everything from a paper clock to a welcome sign. The 3rd section has everything from gift boxes to bookmarks. The 4th section shows and talks you through everything from what tools you will need to teaching you each of the stitches. The 5th section is packed full of all the templates you need to create the amazing projects. I would highly recommend this book! It's a perfect addition to any crafters collection. * Crochet Addict UK *</p><h2>Little Prisoners: A tragic story of siblings trapped in a world of abuse and suffering</h2><p><p>From the Sunday Times bestselling author comes a harrowing and moving memoir about two innocent and frightened &#x2018;unfosterable&#x2019; children who do not know what it means to be loved.</p><p>This is the third book in the series.</p><p>The shock that strikes Casey and her family when Ashton and Olivia arrive is immeasurable.

With wit, honesty, and humility, Blofeld portrays his search for wisdom and his discovery of a genuine spiritual path. He describes in vivid detail his life in Peking and his travels in Tibet, Mongolia, China, India, and Burma: the worlds of remote mountain monasteries, the sacred inner chambers of sages and yogis, and the inspired lives of simple, ordinary people. The book is particularly valuable for its sensitive picture of a world that no longer exists. As Huston Smith remarks in his Foreword, "Blofeld encountered Chinese Buddhism and Taosim at a very special moment in history, the final moment before they came under Communist onslaught. To have his intimate glimpses into what they were like as still-living traditions is historically important." <br><br>Among John Blofeld's notable books are <i>The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet </i> and <i>Bodhisattva of Compassion, </i> both in Shambhala Dragon Editions, and <i>The Book of Changes, </i> a translation of the <i>I Ching. </i></p><p>John Blofeld (1913&#x2013;1987) was a world-renowned scholar and writer who devoted his life to the study of Eastern religion, especially Taoism and Buddhism.</p><h2>A Place for Truth: Leading Thinkers Explore Life&#39;s Hardest Questions</h2><p>Many today pursue knowledge and even wisdom. But what about truth? In an age that disputes whether truth can be universalized beyond one&#39;s own personal experience, it seems quaint to speak of finding truth. But whether in the ivory towers of the academy or in the midst of our everyday lives, we continue to seek after the true, the beautiful and the good. Since its founding at Harvard in 1992, The Veritas Forum has provided a place for the university world to explore the deepest questions of truth and life. What does it mean to be human? Does history have a purpose? Is life meaningful? Can rational people believe in God? Now gathered in one volume are some of The Veritas Forum&#39;s most notable presentations, with contributions from Francis Collins, Tim Keller, N. T. Wright, Mary Poplin and more. Volume editor Dallas Willard introduces each presentation, highlighting its significance and putting it in context for us today. Also included are selected question and answer sessions with the speakers from the original forum experiences. Come eavesdrop on some of today&#39;s leading Christian thinkers and their dialogue partners. And consider how truth might find a place in your own life.</p><p><strong>Dallas Willard</strong> is professor of philosophy at the University of Southern California. He is the author of such books as <em>The Divine Conspiracy, Renovation of the Heart</em> and <em>Hearing God.</em>"You will be ultimately strengthened in your Christian faith if you read carefully this genuinely unique book." (Darold Morgan, Christian Ethics Today, Winter 2012)<br><br>"The Veritas Forum began at Harvard University in 1992 as an effort to engage students with the deep issues of truth and meaning that its founders believed were lacking in the modern university setting. In <em>A Place for Truth</em>, Dallas Willard has edited a collection of speeches from two decades of Veritas discussions that attempt to address life's most difficult questions." (Relevant Magazine, September-October 2010)<br><br>"Since its founding in 1992, The Veritas Forum has provided a place for the university world to explore the deepest questions of truth and life. <em>A Place for Truth</em> gathers the Forum's most notable presentations, with contributions from Francis Collins, Tim Keller, N.T. Wright, Mary Poplin, and more." (Kathleen Samuelson, CBA Retailers Resources, August 2010)<br><br>"These essays, mostly by Christian thinkers, are serious dialogue about important questions. Whether you find in them enlightenment and encouragement, or much to challenge, I hope you will agree that The Veritas Forum has done a service to the academy by encouraging the discussions."

Maid of honor Kate Lockwood is determined to break through best man Grant Mason's defences. An anthropologist, Kate makes her living studying the dead. She is particularly interested in the prehistoric Adena civilization that once called the area home. A large burial mound sits on Mason family land, and Kate wants permission to excavate. But Grant refuses and tells Kate to stay away from the mound.&nbsp;<br><br>Kate respects Grant's desire to honor his grandfather's belief that the dead should not be disturbed. However, the more she researches the more it becomes clear that Grant is hiding something. When one of Grant's friends is killed&#x2014;and the sheriff is away on his honeymoon&#x2014;the couple joins forces to assist the deputy in the investigation.&nbsp;<br><br>When Kate comes under attack she is certain it is connected to the burial mound. Grant seems concerned for Kate's safety, but despite their explosive attraction she can't help but be suspicious of his motives. Can Kate trust the man she's come to love, or will the wrong decision be her final act?</p><p>Karen Harper is the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;and<em> USA TODAY</em> bestselling author of romantic suspense.

"You're not the only one in this family who can solve a mystery. It's either you've finally decided to share with your maid of honor, <em>moi,</em> where you and Gabe are going on your honeymoon or that you're going to have Detective Vic Reingold give the bride away. After all, he's helped you out twice. I'm betting on the latter. Or is it bridal jitters in general?" Kate asked, leaning closer across their restaurant table. "Tell me."<br><br>"I'm going to. I have to," Tess said, suddenly looking as if she was going to cry amid this celebration. "Actually, I wanted a public place to explain it all so you don't go crazy."<br><br>"Go crazy? You're not having second thoughts, not after all you and Gabe have been through?"<br><br>"Of course not! Never that. I love Gabe, and we've got the perfect life planned out together."<br><br>The Lockwood sisters sat in the back booth of the Little Italy Restaurant in their hometown of Cold Creek, Ohio, on a rainy June afternoon, four days before Tess's wedding to Falls County Sheriff Gabe McCord. Kate, who'd lived and worked in the British Isles this year and had flown in only yesterday, had to laugh at the European name and decor of this place, plunked right in the heart of rural southern Ohio on the edge of Appalachia.<br><br>Although the Lockwood family's beginnings in this small town had been humble, Kate was used to the international world of academia, where she loved research and fieldwork in her area of anthropology. She was looking forward to writing a book and teaching again at the college level. She knew she'd done well as one of the youngest professors in the country, but it was always onward and upward for her. Her East Coast schooling and Phi Beta Kappa rï¿½sumï¿½ had opened doors in Europe for her studies of the Celtic civilization.<br><br>Kate hoped being here for the wedding would give her a chance to pursue her theory that the Celts might be linked to the prehistoric but advanced Adena civilization that had lived in this area and left behind burial mounds. The scattered, man-made hills she'd played on as a child could house skeletons and grave goods to help prove her theory and really make her name. Her stomach always cramped with excitement at that thought, but right now it was more important to calm her sister's nerves.<br><br>"It's about the party tonight," Tess went on. "I need to let you know before someone brings it up. Char knows, so you should, too."<br><br>Char was their middle sister, who was yet to arrive for the wedding. Kate was thirty, Charlene twenty-six and Tess twenty-four. It unsettled Kate a bit that the youngest of them was so in love when she herself had never really needed a man&#x2014;except her mentor, Carson Cantrell, at the university, but she'd left the country before permanent plans had come from that. The two older Lockwood sisters were married only to their careers. Char, a social worker in New Mexico among the Navajo, was the family's bleeding heart, but she understood Kate's dedication to her career.<br><br>As the oldest, Kate liked to keep control of things. She'd felt that way ever since their father deserted the family years ago. Now Mom had died and wouldn't be here for this happy event&#x2014;maybe happy, because Tess suddenly looked as if she was going to cry. Kate shoved the bread basket aside, reached across the table and covered Tess's clenched hands with hers.<br><br>"I guess I'd better just say it," Tess blurted. "Gabe says that's the best."<br><br>"Are you pregnant? Tess, honey, you're not showing, and you wouldn't be the first bride over the ages of civilizations to&#x2014;"<br><br>"No, not that. I know you always take the long view of things&#x2014;over the ages, the historic, but&#x2014;Kate, I've asked Dad to come here and give me away for the wedding."<br><br>Kate gasped and squeezed Tess's hands. "Our dad?"<br><br>It was an utterly ridiculous thing to say, but she was hoping she'd heard wrong or that it was some sort of joke. She felt as if she'd been slapped. She released Tess's hands and sat back hard against the wooden seat. Dr. Kathryn Lockwood always had something to say, but for a moment, she was speechless. Then the words poured out.<br><br>"Tess, are you serious? The father who deserted us when we were in desperate need of him after your kidnapping? The man who blamed our mother when you were taken? The man who, for heaven's sake, had an affair with your groom's mother&#x2014;and she'll be here tomorrow and at the wedding? The man who will then be in the same wedding photos we'll have for decades? At least you didn't just spring him on us when he waltzed in! 'Oh, Kate and Char, look who's here!'"<br><br>Several others in the restaurant looked their way. The server, who had been approaching the table with their salads, did a U-turn back toward the kitchen. Kate finally shut her mouth, propped her elbows on the table and leaned her head in her hands.<br><br>Tess spoke, her voice shaky. "Like I said, I told Char already. She was surprised, too, but she's okay with it. I've reconciled with him&#x2014;Dad&#x2014;over the phone these last months. He's sorry. He knows he did a lot of things wrong. He's rebuilt his life in Oregon with his wife, Gwen. I've talked to her, and she sounds really kind and understanding."<br><br>"And I guess I'm not." Kate looked up, now clenching her hands in her lap so she wouldn't pound on the table. "I hope she can trust him not to cheat on her and then abandon her and their kids. He does have children with her, doesn't he? Is he bringing them?"<br><br>"Yes, two sons, Josh and Jerod. They're seven and five. He wants them to see where he grew up and to meet all of us. I know how hard you took it&#x2014;the things he did. You above all, but it's my wedding day, and a father should give his daughter away. Don't you want to patch things up and see him again?"<br><br>Kate almost said that she'd much rather have a long-dead Adena warrior resurrected from one of their burial mounds around here, but she managed to keep her mouth shut on that.<br><br>"So," Kate said, her voice calmer now. "He'll be at the center of things, not just a guest."<br><br>"You mean everyone will talk about the Lockwoods again?"<br><br>"I don't care what people around here say. Really. And obviously, Gabe is okay with this."<br><br>"Yes, he is. He understands, and we've told his mother. But I really wanted you to understand, just the way my future mother-in-law does. With Mom gone now, I do see you as the head of the family, so it's important to me."<br><br>Kate couldn't keep from rolling her eyes. "Head of the family until Jack Lockwood arrives with wife and kids in tow and takes over. Oh, sure, I guess I'm curious about him, but then, I'm curious about everything."<br><br>"Like especially what's buried in local Adena mounds, right?"<br><br>"Don't try to change the subject. For you, of course, I'll honor your wishes for your guests and who you choose to be in your wedding party. But don't expect your maid of honor to forgive that man. Can't do it, though I'll be civil to him and them. If we've got our crazy cousins coming from that strange religious sect they're in, we might as well have the ghost of childhood past there, too."<br><br>Tess breathed an audible sigh of relief; she seemed to deflate as her stiff stance relaxed a bit and she leaned back. "Once you meet Grant Mason, I don't think you'll be looking at Dad anyway," she said, trying another tactic. "Tall, handsome, deep voice. A Viking revisited, so too bad you're not studying them. Best man, for sure."<br><br>"I remember him. But he was older than me, and I didn't really know him. So he's stayed best friends with Gabe all these years?"<br><br>Tess nodded and wiped under her eyes. "Right. Even when Gabe was in the service and Grant went to college, then lived out West for a while, working with logging crews so he'd have that background when he took over his family's lumber mill. He's got a gorgeous house with a great view. You'll see that at the party tonight. Wish Char would be here for that, too, but we'll all be together soon."<br><br>At least, Kate thought, Jack Lockwood, alias former father, would not be here tonight, so she could enjoy herself. Not only was she curious to see Grant Mason, but she also couldn't wait to examine the Adena burial site she'd found on an old map in the university archives when she was back in the States at Christmas. The so-called Mason Mound was about twenty yards behind Grant's house, and she was much more eager to see it than him.<br><br>The caterers Grant had hired from the upscale Lake Azure area had taken over the kitchen, and he didn't want to disturb the setup for the buffet or the bar at the far end of the living room. So he sat in his favorite chair looking out over the back forest view through his massive picture window.<br><br>The guests for the party he was throwing for his best friend, Gabe, and his fiancï¿½e, Tess, would be here soon&#x2014;eighteen people, a nice number for mixing and chatting. He'd laid in champagne for toasts to the happy couple.<br><br>Gabe and Grant had been best friends since elementary school, when a teacher had seated them in alphabetical order by first names. Grant had been the first to marry. Lacey had been his high-school sweetheart, head of the cheerleaders, prom queen to his king. How unoriginal&#x2014;and what a disaster.<br><br>Four years into the marriage, she had wanted out of what she called "the boondocks," while he intended to make his life here running the lumber mill that had been in his family for three generations. He mingled with the movers and shakers in Columbus and D.C., lobbied politicians to pass green laws and made sure his loggers planted two trees for every one they cut, so it wasn't as if he was always in little Cold Creek. But Lacey's tastes ran to fancy restaurants, import shops and exotic places&#x2014;probably a life like Tess's oldest, world-traveling sister was used to.<br><br>The divorce had been Lacey's call, though he knew he was better off without her. She'd kept insisting she was too young to get tied down with children, too, and he'd love to raise a family here. Yet, when it came to women, he, too, felt caught between two worlds. He might wear work jeans and steel-toed boots and fit in with his good-old-boy loggers and cutters, but he liked tailored clothes and a bit of glitz and class in his play-time&#x2014;and in a woman.<br><br>And he did like this time of year, since the days were getting longer. Not only did they get more done at the mill, but when he came home, he could also look out at this view while he ate or took a run on the path through the thirty acres of hardwood forest he owned. Occasionally, he'd even climb into the great, old tree house Grandpa and Dad had made for him and his brother, Brad, and survey the stunning scene of treetops and, above and beyond that, the blue-green foothills, which fringed the Appalachians.<br><br>From that vantage point, he could look almost straight down on the low, conical prehistoric Indian mound&#x2014; Mason's Mound, the locals called it. Years ago when he was twelve and Brad was ten, with their friends Todd and Paul, right beneath the huge bird's-eye maple that held the tree house in its limbs and guarded the mound, they had done the forbidden and seen such wonderful and terrible things....<br><br>The sound of the doorbell sliced through his thoughts. He glanced at his watch. Someone was early, probably Gabe and Tess so they'd be here when the others arrived. Tess was bringing her oldest sister, Kathryn, with them, the woman who would be his partner for the wedding, the maid of honor to his best-man role. He barely remembered what she looked like, and that was from years ago. As he hurried toward the door, he smelled something delicious in the kitchen, heard the caterers clinking china or glassware.<br><br>To his amazement, Brad stood outside, looking as if he'd already been partying but hardly dressed for the occasion. He lived fifty miles away, and he looked like hell. Maybe his high-flying bachelor life was doing him in.<br><br>"Brad. You all right? You should have called."<br><br>"And get 'nother lecture about not declaring bankruptcy for my paper mill&#x2014;the Lancaster Paper Mill owned and run by the brilliant, the illustrious Bradley Mason, younger bro of the brilliant, the illustrious, grand Grant Mason of Mason Lumber Mill of Cold Creek? Hell, Grant, I laid off the last workers today and closed the place. America the beautiful's cutting back on paper in this big, bad digital age, and my mill's jus' 'nother victim of that."<br><br>Brad's shoulder bumped against the door frame as he half walked, half stumbled into the house. Grant could smell the liquor on his breath when he got out of the June breeze. Had he driven fifty miles drunk?<br><br>"I hope you got your booze just uptown," he told him.<br><br>"Yep. My fav'rite ole watering hole in new town."<br><br>Looking at Brad, drunk or sober, was always like seeing a slightly younger version of himself, although Brad's blond hair had darkened over the years. Grant was outside enough that his stayed fairly bleached, but they both had their dad's light blue eyes. Grant was slightly taller at six foot two, but their features showed their family ties, and they were both built like the lumbermen from generations of Masons, though since Grant had worked in an office these past years, he'd lost some of his bulk.<br><br>"Ah, the old homestead," Brad muttered, looking around. "But looking ever new with the lord of the manor's stamp on it big-time. I'm hoping you'll give me a good job&#x2014;just tempor'ry&#x2014;in Dad and Grandpa's old mill, for which you're caretaker now."<br><br>"Which I own," Grant said, closing the door behind him. <em>"Own</em> because I bought you out and stayed here to keep it going while you skipped town."<br><br>"Yeah, well, I still know the ropes. A job there'll do for now, foreman or somethin'."<br><br>"You know Todd's the mill foreman. His life is trees, living and dead."<br><br>"Yeah, good ole Todd, the modern-day Tarzan, climbing trees when he's not buzzing them into boards for fancy furniture." Brad got only as far as the arm of the leather couch before he sat down, nearly tipping over onto the cushions. He tried to give the Tarzan yell, which came out garbled and made him start to cough.<br><br>Grant's heart went out to him, however frustrating he was.<br><br>"Hey, you're having a party&#x2014;with a bar! I see my timing's good. I'll go up to my old room and clean up a bit. Clothes in the car, but I'll jus' borrow somethin' of yours, like in the old days. So, what's the occasion?"<br><br>"A pre-wedding party for Gabe McCord, Tess Lockwood and guests."<br><br>"Todd coming, then?"<br><br>"And Paul, as a matter of fact."<br><br></p><h2>Making Small Workshop Tools (Workshop Practice)</h2><p>Making twenty-two simple but useful adjuncts to the tool kit for bench and lathe use, none taking any more than 3 to 4 hours or involving special materials, yet each able to save considerable time in use as well as aiding accuracy.

What they had in common was their aftermath&#x2014;each required compensation for lives lost, bodies maimed, livelihoods wrecked, economies and ecosystems upended. In each instance, an objective third party had to step up and dole out allocated funds: in each instance, Presidents, Attorneys General, and other public officials have asked Kenneth R. Feinberg to get the job done.</p><p>In <i>Who Gets What?</i>, Feinberg reveals the deep thought that must go into each decision, not to mention the most important question that arises after a tragedy: why compensate at all?

I respected the hell out of him, loved him like a father . . . but there wasn&#x2019;t a fucking thing the Reapers MC president could&#x2019;ve said to slow me down in that instant.

Fuckin&#x2019; cathartic as hell&#x2014;his life was over. More screaming cut through the fog of violence.</p><p>Damn straight, she should be screaming. She should be fucking afraid.</p><p>&#x201c;You asshole!&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled, because from Mel it sounded sweet as hell. She&#x2019;d called me an asshole ten thousand different ways over the years, ranging from enraged hatred to whispered insults between kisses. It worked for me, too. I was a total asshole, but for once she&#x2019;d just have to suck it up and deal with the consequences.</p><p>She&#x2019;d broken the fucking rules by bringing him here.</p><p>No bikers.</p><p>Simple, right? One condition I&#x2019;d given her. No. Fucking. Bikers. All she had to do was keep her ass out of my world, because so long as I didn&#x2019;t have to see her sucking someone else&#x2019;s cock, I could pretend it wasn&#x2019;t happening.</p><p>Not a complicated concept.</p><p>Arms came around me, strong arms dragging me off my victim before I could finish killing him. Then I heard Puck&#x2019;s voice in my ear.</p><p>Puck.</p><p>My best friend. Puck, who&#x2019;d taken my back for a year and a half in prison. I&#x2019;d trusted him with my life inside, and I trusted him now. I should be listening, but I really, really wanted to end this cockwad&#x2019;s life.</p><p>I shrugged Puck off, determined to finish it.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not worth it, bro,&#x201d; Puck gritted out. Melanie was still making noise. Between us, her pussy of a date moaned and cried, whimpering about how he didn&#x2019;t want to die. Yeah, you better beg for your life, bitch. &#x201c;You kill him here, you&#x2019;ll never see your kid again. Whatever shit goes down with you and Mel, you gotta think of Izzy.&#x201d;</p><p>Fuck. I took deep breaths, forcing myself to calm as I stood over the man, staring between him and Melanie.</p><p>Had to focus.</p><p>The image of my beautiful, fuzzy-haired blonde baby girl flashed through my mind. Izzy. I&#x2019;d do it for Izzy. I ran a hand through my hair, holding back the fire raging through me.</p><p>&#x201c;Get him out of here,&#x201d; I finally managed to growl out. Nobody moved as the man rolled to one side, whining like the little cunt he was. Fucking pussy hadn&#x2019;t even managed to get in a hit. A distant part of me noted he wore leather with Harley Davidson patches, but no MC colors. Who did he think he was, coming to the Silver Bastards clubhouse? This wasn&#x2019;t a game. &#x201c;Get him out of here before I kill him!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck,&#x201d; Horse muttered, stepping forward to grab the douche by the armpits. A path cleared as he started dragging the man toward the door. Melanie shouted at me again, and I turned on her, stalking forward. This was it&#x2014;I&#x2019;d had enough of her shit. She wanted to play games? Perfect, because I loved to play, and she knew damned well I liked to play rough.</p><p>Melanie was about to get one hell of a reality check.</p><p>Picnic stepped in front of her, arms crossed as he stared me down.</p><p>&#x201c;Not happening, son.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s none of your business,&#x201d; I snarled. I was right, too&#x2014;so what if his old lady loved the little bitch? He&#x2019;d been standing between me and Melanie for way the fuck too long, and this little scene tonight wasn&#x2019;t club business. Melanie was mine to deal with. There wasn&#x2019;t a man in the room who had the right to say otherwise, including my president.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the one who came here,&#x201d; I reminded him.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even know where we were going!&#x201d; Melanie yelled from behind him. &#x201c;It was just a date, you asshole!&#x201d;</p><p>Red filled my vision again. My jaw clenched, and I smelled the blood on my hands. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a fucking biker. You broke the rules, Mel. Get over here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not happening,&#x201d; Pic said, his face grim. &#x201c;I am not dealing with this tonight. Painter, get your ass home. Melanie, you&#x2019;re with me.&#x201d;</p><p>The air around us cooled. The brothers&#x2014;Silver Bastards and Reapers both&#x2014;had been watching all along, but now there was a new, quiet intensity in the air. This had just gone from a confrontation between me and a woman to a confrontation between two full members, and we didn&#x2019;t usually air that shit outside the chapel. Pic might be the president, but like I said, this wasn&#x2019;t club business.</p><p>He needed to step back. Now.</p><p>Suddenly Mel shoved him out of the way, although how she did it I had no idea&#x2014;she weighed maybe a dime and a quarter soaking wet, the little witch.</p><p>&#x201c;What I do is none of your goddamned business!&#x201d; she shouted.</p><p>I caught Pic&#x2019;s eye and he shrugged, knowing he was beat. &#x201c;Fuck it. I&#x2019;m done with both of you.&#x201d;</p><p>About time. I gave Mel a slow smile, savoring the moment she realized what&#x2019;d just happened. We might be in another club&#x2019;s house, but the Silver Bastards were brothers to the Reapers. Pic had spoken because Mel was tight with his old lady, but he&#x2019;d been overstepping. If she&#x2019;d kept her mouth fucking shut, she might&#x2019;ve walked out of here. Now? Not so much.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you a ride home, Mel,&#x201d; I said with soft menace, enjoying the sudden shock in her face. &#x201c;We can talk when we get there. Privacy, you know?&#x201d;</p><p>She glanced around, eyes wide. She knew half the men here tonight, but they could be strangers for all the good that&#x2019;d do her now. Ruger. Gage. Horse. Puck. They all stared back at her, eyes cold. Not one of them would lift a finger to protect her&#x2014;not from me.</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck . . .&#x201d; she whispered. Yeah, enjoy your reality check, baby.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;ll do that, too,&#x201d; I said, thinking about that hot, sweet pussy of hers. Hadn&#x2019;t felt that for years now, but I still dreamed about it every goddamned night.</p><p>I reached for her, jerking her into my arms as she screamed. Nobody moved. Seconds later I had her over my shoulder, hauling her out into the night. Her hands pounded my back, which was adorable because she didn&#x2019;t stand a chance.</p><p>Little Melanie was all grown up.</p><p>I&#x2019;d spent five years dancing to her tune, but that shit was over. In my mind, she&#x2019;d lost her freedom the instant she threw her leg over another man&#x2019;s bike.</p><p>Now all I had to do was fuck some sense into her.</p><br><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><br><p><i>Five years earlier</i></p><i> </i><p><i>Southern California, State Correctional Facility</i></p><br><p>Dear Levi,</p><p>You know, someday you should really tell me how you got started with your artwork. It seems like I share everything with you, but you never tell me anything real about yourself. It&#x2019;s kind of weird. I keep thinking that I should stop writing to you, because it&#x2019;s not like we even really know each other. (I still don&#x2019;t quite understand why you let me borrow your car all this time, but I really appreciate it&#x2014;I make sure the oil is changed and stuff.) Then something will happen and I find myself wanting to tell you about it, so I write again.</p><p>Anyway, you don&#x2019;t have to write back if you don&#x2019;t want to. I know you think I&#x2019;m just some kid, but I&#x2019;m twenty years old now and I&#x2019;ve lived through my own shit.</p><p>Okay, so I had to stop writing for a while. Jessica stopped by&#x2014;we&#x2019;re getting a house together this semester. (Um, just so you know, she told me. About you and her, I mean. She said it didn&#x2019;t mean anything, but I can&#x2019;t help but wonder if you still think about her like that.) She&#x2019;s doing really well, by the way. We just finished summer session, and she got a 3.00 GPA, which kind of kicked ass. I&#x2019;m super proud of her, because she has learning disabilities, so it&#x2019;s not like that was easy. I have good news, too&#x2014;they told me today that I&#x2019;m getting a full tuition/books scholarship, which means I can use the rest of my financial aid to live on. I won&#x2019;t have to work this year, so I&#x2019;m loading up on the credits. If everything goes right, I&#x2019;ll transfer to the University of Idaho in January, a whole semester early!</p><p>So . . . something happened that I wanted to tell you about. I met a guy. He&#x2019;s cute, and we have the same birthday&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t that funny? We went to this party at a house downtown and they were singing &#x201c;Happy Birthday&#x201d; to him and then Jessica started singing &#x201c;Happy Birthday&#x201d; to me and things sort of grew from there. We&#x2019;ve been on a couple dates now, and he just asked me if it could be exclusive.</p><p>What do you think about that?</p><p>I mean, do you think that a guy should be asking that after such a short time? I know, I should probably talk to Loni about it, but she totally worries all the time, and . . . anyway . . . I just wanted to know your opinion.</p><p>Should I start dating him for real? Any reason I shouldn&#x2019;t?</p><p>Melanie</p><p>PS&#x2014;thanks for the drawing you sent&#x2014;it almost feels like I&#x2019;ve been there. Every time I see one of your sketches it blows me away. I can&#x2019;t imagine being able to create something like that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I folded the letter carefully, looking out across the yard. The air was warm&#x2014;perfect, really&#x2014;and I thought about Idaho, where you couldn&#x2019;t sit outside like this for most of the year.</p><p>The only good thing about prison was I hadn&#x2019;t frozen my ass off last winter. People back home saved all year to try and find some sun during the cold months, but I&#x2019;d gotten my snowbird &#x201c;vacation&#x201d; for free. In the distance, Puck wandered toward me, his path apparently aimless. I knew better. He had shit to distribute, and it was my job to watch his back and make sure nobody noticed anything while he made his rounds.</p><p>That&#x2019;s when Prince Fester of the Fuckwits ran up to me, grinning.</p><p>&#x201c;You get a new letter from Melanie?&#x201d; he asked, eyes bright. I shrugged my shoulders, trying to ignore him. This idiot was me and Puck&#x2019;s cellmate, and I gave serious thought to shanking his ass at least twice a day.</p><p>&#x201c;She send any pictures?&#x201d; he asked, licking his lips. I fought back a snarl.</p><p>&#x201c;Shut your fuckin&#x2019; mouth. I catch you touching her picture again, I&#x2019;ll kill you. That&#x2019;s not a joke, Fester. Puck and I already planned out exactly how we&#x2019;re gonna do it.&#x201d;</p><p>His smile faded, his feelings obviously hurt. Jesus help me, just one little slice . . . that&#x2019;s all I want. Just one swipe of the knife to take out his tongue. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mean that.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t answer, because the man had the brain of an eight-year-old. A vicious, dangerous eight-year-old who&#x2019;d been committing armed robbery half his life, but trust me&#x2014;he was seriously lacking in the IQ area. Puck was always telling me to be patient with him, and I tried. Seriously. I tried fuckin&#x2019; hard, but sometimes it took everything I had not to cut his tongue out for real.</p><p>&#x201c;So, I had this idea,&#x201d; he said, leaning up against the wall next to me.</p><p>&#x201c;Shut the fuck up and go away.&#x201d;</p><p>He frowned. I ignored him until he shuffled off like a kicked puppy, keeping my eyes on Puck as he drifted toward a cluster of skinheads. Always thought that was funny. They called him a mongrel behind his back, but when he had product they were happy to forgive Mr. Redhouse for his many sins against the Aryan race. I&#x2019;d have laughed if I wasn&#x2019;t so busy making sure nobody murdered him.</p><p>Just two more weeks.</p><p>Two more weeks in this shithole, then I&#x2019;d be headed home to Coeur d&#x2019;Alene. Back to my bike and my club. My brothers.</p><p>Melanie.</p><p>Pretty Melanie, driving around in my car because I&#x2019;d felt guilty about leaving her alone without transportation that last night . . . Christ, thought I&#x2019;d be loaning it to her for a couple days, and now she&#x2019;d had it for a year. Ridiculous, but who was I kidding? I liked the idea of her in my car&#x2014;of her thinking of me every day. Of her owing me.</p><p>Not like I needed the damned thing in prison.</p><p>I reached down, feeling the letter in my pocket, wondering what the hell I should tell her about the asshole trying to get into her pants. Wanted to say she should blow him off&#x2014;he wasn&#x2019;t good enough for her. She was too young, too soft, and too pretty for some twenty-year-old cocksucker looking to get his rocks off. He didn&#x2019;t care about her, either&#x2014;he just wanted to get laid. They all did. Maybe he&#x2019;d grow out of it someday, although I had five years on him and I hadn&#x2019;t yet.</p><p>I had no right to an opinion, though. She hardly knew me. We&#x2019;d spent maybe eight hours together total, and trust me when I say there weren&#x2019;t any happy endings. I&#x2019;d given her a ride home, watched a movie with her. Taken her to dinner to get her out of the club&#x2019;s way&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t even a particularly nice dinner, not like she deserved. She was nothing to me.</p><p>Fucking hell.</p><p>Puck glanced in my direction, offering a jerk of his chin. Deal was done. I pushed off the wall, wandering slowly toward him. Fester tried to follow me, but I shut him down with a dirty look. Just another day, exactly like every other I&#x2019;d spent in here the last thirteen months.</p><p>Except it wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Today I&#x2019;d learned some prick was sniffing around Mellie, and there wasn&#x2019;t a goddamn thing I could do about it. For all I knew he was fucking her right now, balls deep, telling her how much he loved her.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>She&#x2019;d probably fall for it, too.</p><p>Mel,</p><p>You know, I write these fuckin&#x2019; letters to you, but they&#x2019;re fake. I ask about your friends and your school and whether you&#x2019;re meeting people. It&#x2019;s bullshit, Mel.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s my reality.</p><p>Yesterday I stabbed someone before he could stab me. Puck and I sold some shit to a bunch of white supremacists and we turned around and sold the same damned thing to some Mexicans. We had pudding with our dinner for dessert.</p></p><h2>Borkmann&#39;s Point: An Inspector Van Veeteren Mystery [2]</h2><p><p><b>International Bestseller&nbsp;</b><br><br>Internationally bestselling author Hï¿½kan Nesser makes his U.S. debut with this riveting tale of murder and suspense that reveals the deep humanity of the characters portrayed even as it sends chills up the spine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chief Inspector Van Veeteren is called to the sleepy coastal town of Kalbringen to assist the local police in the investigation of two recent ax murders. Soon the case turns from bad to worse when another body turns up and one of Van Veeteren&#x2019;s colleagues, a young female detective, disappears without a trace. Now Van Veeteren must find the killer, and, it is hoped, his colleague, before anyone else comes to harm. Riveting and intellectually satisfying,<i> </i><b>Borkmann&#x2019;s Point</b> unfolds like a chess match where each move could prove deadly.</p></p><p><b>Hï¿½kan Nesser</b> was born in 1950 in Sweden. In 1993 he was awarded the Swedish Crime Writers&#x2019; Academy Prize for new authors for his novel <i>Mind&#x2019;s Eye</i>, and is the only author to have won the Academy&#x2019;s best novel award three times: in 1994 for <i>Borkmann&#x2019;s Point</i>; in 1996 for <i>Woman With Birthmark</i>; and in 2007 for <i>A Rather Different Story</i>. In 1999 he was awarded the Crime Writers of Scandinavia&#x2019;s Glass Key Award for the best crime novel of the year for <i>Carambole</i>. His novels have been published to wide acclaim in twenty-five countries.Had Ernst Simmel known he was to be the Axman's second victim, he would no doubt have downed a few more drinks at The Blue Ship.<br><br> As it was, he settled for a brandy with his coffee and a whiskey on the rocks in the bar, while trying unsuccessfully to make eye contact with the bleached-blond woman in the far corner; but anyway, his heart wasn't in it. Presumably, she was one of the new employees at the canning factory. He had never seen her before, and he had a fair idea about the available talent.<br><br> To his right was Herman Schalke, a reporter on de Journaal, trying to interest him in a cheap weekend trip to Kaliningrad or somewhere of the sort, and when they eventually got round to pinning down his last evening, it seemed probable that Schalke must have been the last person in this life to speak to Simmel.<br><br> Always assuming that the Axman didn't have some message to impart before finishing him off, that is. Which wasn't all that likely since the blow, as in the previous case, had come diagonally from behind and from slightly below, so a little chat seemed improbable.<br><br> "Ah, well!" Simmel had said after draining the last drops from his glass. "I'd better be getting back to the old lady."<br><br> If Schalke remembered rightly, that is. In any case, he'd tried to talk him out of it. Pointed out that it was barely eleven and the night was yet young. But Simmel had been adamant.<br><br> That was the right word. Adamant. Just eased himself off his bar stool. Adjusted his glasses and stroked that pathetic wisp of hair over his bald head like he always did--as if that would fool anybody--muttered a few words, then left. The last Schalke had seen of him was the white outline of his back as he paused in the doorway and seemed to be hesitating about which direction to take.<br><br> Looking back, that was distinctly odd. For Christ's sake, surely Simmel knew his way home?<br><br> But maybe he just stood there for a few seconds to fill his lungs with the fresh night air. It had been a hot day; summer was not over yet and the evenings had started to exude a mellowness enriched by many months of summer sun. Enriched and refined.<br><br> As if made for drinking in deep draughts, somebody had said. These nights.<br><br> In fact, it wasn't a bad night for a journey to the other side, if one might be allowed such a thought. Schalke's section of de Journaal was mainly concerned with matters sporting and a dash of folklore, but in his capacity as the last person to have seen Simmel alive, he had presumed to write an obituary of the property developer who had been so suddenly plucked from our midst . . . a pillar of our society, one might say, who had just returned to his native town after a sojourn of several years abroad (on the Costa del Sol along with other like-minded citizens with a bent for effective tax planning, but perhaps this was not the occasion to refer to that), survived by a wife and two grown-up children, having reached the age of fifty but still in the prime of his life, no doubt about that.<br><br> The scent of evening seemed full of promise; he paused in the doorway, hesitating.<br><br> Would it be a good idea to take a stroll over to Fisherman's Square and down by the harbor?<br><br> What was the point of going home as early as this? The sweetish smell of the bedroom and Grete's overweight body shot through his mind, and he decided to take a little walk. Only a short one. Even if there was nothing to pick up, the warm night air would make it worth the effort.<br><br> He crossed over Langvej and turned off toward Bungeskirke. At the same time, the murderer emerged from the shadows under the lime trees in Leisner Park and started following him. Quietly and carefully, a safe distance behind, not a sound from his rubber soles. Tonight was his third attempt, but even so, there was no trace of impatience. He knew what he had to do, and the last thing on his mind was to rush things.<br><br> Simmel continued along Hoistraat and took the steps down toward the harbor. He slowed down when he came to Fisherman's Square and sauntered across the deserted cobbles toward the covered market. Two women were busy talking at the corner of Dooms Alley, but he didn't appear to pay them any attention. Perhaps he wasn't sure about their status, or perhaps he had something else in mind.<br><br> Or maybe he just didn't feel like it. When he came to the quay he paused for a few minutes to smoke a cigarette, watching the boats bobbing in the marina. The murderer took the opportunity of enjoying a cigarette himself in the shadow of the warehouse on the other side of the Esplanade. Held it well hidden inside his cupped hand so that the glow wouldn't give him away, and didn't take his eyes off his victim for a single second.<br><br> When Simmel flicked his cigarette end into the water and set off in the direction of the municipal woods, the murderer knew that tonight was the night.<br><br> True, there were only about three hundred yards of trees here between the Esplanade and Rikken, the yuppie part of the town where Simmel lived, and there were plenty of lights along the paths; but not all were working and three hundred yards could prove to be rather a long way. In any case, when Simmel heard a faint footstep behind him, he was barely fifty yards into the woods and the darkness was dense on all sides.<br><br> Warm and full of promise, as already noted, but dense.<br><br> He probably didn't have time to feel scared. If so, it could only have been in the last fraction of a second. The razor-sharp edge entered from behind, between the second and fourth vertebrae, slicing diagonally through the third, straight through the spinal column, the esophagus and the carotid artery. Half an inch deeper and in all probability his head would have been separated completely from his body.<br><br> Which would have been spectacular, but was of minor significance for the outcome.<br><br> In accordance with all imaginable criteria, Ernst Simmel must have been dead even before he hit the ground. His face landed on the well-trodden gravel path with full force, smashing his glasses and causing any number of secondary injuries. Blood was pouring out of his throat, from above and below, and when the murderer carefully dragged him into the bushes, he could still hear a faint bubbling sound. He squatted there in silence while a group of four or five youths passed by, then wiped his weapon clean in the grass and set off back in the direction of the harbor.<br><br> Twenty minutes later he was sitting at his kitchen table with a steaming cup of tea, listening to the bath slowly filling up. If his wife had still been with him, she would doubtless have asked if he'd had a hard day, and if he was very tired.<br><br> Not especially, he might have replied. It's taking a bit of time, but everything is going according to plan.<br><br> Glad to hear it, darling, she might have said, putting a hand on his shoulder. Glad to hear it . . .<br><br> He nodded, and raised his cup to his mouth.<br> 2<br><br> The sands went on forever.<br><br> Went on forever, the same as ever. A calm, gray sea under a pale sky. A strip of firm, damp sand next to the water where he could maintain a reasonable pace. Alongside a drier, grayish-white expanse where beach grass and windswept bushes took over. Deep inside the salt marshes birds were wheeling in broad, lazy circles, filling the air with their melancholy cries.<br><br> Van Veeteren checked his watch and paused. Hesitated for a moment. In the hazy distance he could just make out the church steeple in s'Greijvin, but it was a long way away. If he kept on walking, it would certainly be another hour before he could sit down with a beer in the cafe on the square.<br><br> It might have been worth the effort, but now that he had paused, it was hard to convince himself of that. It was three o'clock. He had set out after lunch--or brunch, depending on how you looked at it. In any case, at about one o'clock, after yet another night when he had gone to bed early but failed to drop off to sleep until well into the small hours. It was hard to tell what was the root cause of his worries and restlessness as he lay there, tossing and turning in the sagging double bed, as the gray light of dawn crept ever closer . . . hard to tell.<br><br> He had been on vacation for three weeks now, quite a long time by his standards, but not exceptional, and as the days passed, during the last week at least, his daily routine had been delayed just a little. Four more days and it would be time for him to return to his office, and he had the distinct impression that when he did so, there would not be much of a spring in his stride. Even though he hadn't really done much apart from resting. Lain back on the beach, reading. Sat in the cafe at s'Greijvin, or nearer at hand in Hellensraut. Strolled up and down these never-ending sands.<br><br> The first week out here with Erich had been a mistake. They had both realized that after the first day, but the arrangement couldn't easily be changed. Erich had been allowed out on parole on condition that he stay with his father on this remote stretch of coast. He still had ten months of his sentence left to serve, and the last time he had been out on parole the outcome had left much to be desired.<br><br> He gazed out to sea. It was just as calm and unfathomable as it had been for the whole of this last week. As if nothing could really make an impression, not even the wind. The waves dying a natural death on the beach seemed to have traveled vast distances bearing neither life nor hope.<br><br> This is not my sea, Van Veeteren thought to himself.<br><br> In July, as his vacation had approached, he had been looking forward to these days with Erich. When they finally arrived, he could hardly wait for them to end, so that he could be left in peace; and now, after a dozen days and nights of solitude, he wanted nothing more than to get back to work again.<br><br> Or was it quite as straightforward as that? Was that perhaps just a convenient way of describing what it was really all about--did there come a point, he had started to wonder, beyond which we no longer look forward to something coming, but only to getting away from what has passed? Getting away. Closing down and moving on, but not looking forward to starting again. Like a journey whose delights decrease in direct proportion to the distance traveled from the starting point, whose sweetness becomes more and more bitter as the goal comes closer . . .<br><br> Get away, he thought. Put an end to it. Bury it.<br><br> This is what they call going downhill. There's always another sea ahead.<br><br> He sighed and removed his sweater. Tied it around his shoulders and started retracing his steps. He was walking into the wind now, and he realized that it would take him longer to get back home . . . just as well to have a few extra hours this evening, come to that. The house needed tidying up, the fridge emptying, the telephone unplugging. He wanted to set off early tomorrow. No point in hanging around unnecessarily.<br><br> He kicked an abandoned plastic bottle over the sands.<br><br> It will be fall tomorrow, he thought.<br><br> He could hear the telephone ringing when he came to the gate. Automatically he started moving more slowly, shortening his strides, fiddling with his keys, in the hope that it would stop ringing by the time he entered the house. In vain. The sound was still carving stubbornly through the gloomy silence. He picked up the receiver.<br><br> "Hello?"<br><br> "Van Veeteren?"<br><br> "That depends."<br><br> "Ha ha . . . Hiller here. How are things?"<br><br> Van Veeteren suppressed an urge to slam the receiver down.<br><br> "Splendid, thank you. It's just that I was under the impression that my vacation wasn't over until Monday."<br><br> "Precisely! I thought you maybe fancied a few more days?"<br><br> Van Veeteren said nothing.<br><br> "I'll bet you'd love to stay a bit longer by the coast if you had the chance, wouldn't you."<br><br> ". . ."<br><br> "Another week, perhaps? Hello?"<br><br> "I'd be grateful if you would come to the point, sir," said Van Veeteren.<br><br> The chief of police seemed to have a coughing fit, and Van Veeteren sighed.<br><br> "Yes, well, a little something has turned up in Kaalbringen. That's only about twenty or thirty miles away from the cottage you're staying in; I don't know if you're familiar with the place. We've been asked to help out, in any case."<br><br> "What's it all about?"<br><br> "Murder. Two of them. Some madman running around and cutting people's heads off with an ax or something. It's all in the papers today, but maybe you haven't--"<br><br> "I haven't seen a paper for three weeks," said Van Veeteren.<br><br> "The latest one--the second, that is--happened yesterday, or rather, the day before. Anyway, we have to send them some reinforcements, and I thought that as you were in the area already, well . . ."<br><br> "Thank you very much."<br><br> "I'll leave it up to you for the time being. I'll send up Munster or Reinhart next week. Assuming you haven't solved it by then, of course."<br><br> "Who's chief of police? In Kaalbringen, I mean."<br><br> Hiller coughed again.<br><br> "His name's Bausen. I don't think you know him. Anyway, he only has another month to go before he retires, and he doesn't seem all that thrilled to have been handed this on his plate just now."<br><br> "How very odd," said Van Veeteren.<br><br> "You'll go straight there tomorrow, I take it?" Hiller was starting to wind up the conversation. "That will mean you don't have to double the journey unnecessarily. Is the water still warm enough for swimming, by the way?"<br><br> "I spend all of every day splashing around."<br><br> "Really . . . really. Well, I'll phone them and say you'll be turning up tomorrow afternoon. OK?"<br><br> "I want Munster," said Van Veeteren.<br><br> "I'll see what I can do," said Hiller.<br><br> Van Veeteren put down the receiver and stood for a while staring at the telephone before pulling out the plug.</p><h2>Making Peace with Imperfection: Discover Your Perfectionism Type, End the Cycle of Criticism, and Embrace Self-Acceptance</h2><p><p><b>Demanding perfection in everything you do can create a life of stress, worry, and overload.&nbsp;With this essential self-help guide, you&#x2019;ll learn to escape the perfectionism trap and cultivate unconditional self-acceptance in an imperfect world.</b></p><p>Are you a perfectionist?&nbsp; Do you wear this title like a badge of honor, even though it creates needless stress in your life?

He gives due attention to historical issues where these bear on what can be known about the settings in which the text emerged. His dominant method is one that approaches Deuteronomy as a finished work.Dr McConville argues that in the context of the ancient world, Deuteronomy should be understood as the radical blueprint for the life of a people, at the same time both spiritual and political, and profoundly different from every other social, political and religious programme. The book incorporates the tension between an open-ended vision of a perfectly ordered society under God, and practical provisions for dealing with the frailty and imperfections of real people. Hence, it is capable of informing our thinking about theorganisation of societies while maintaining a vision of the kingdom of God.</p><p>Senior Lecturer in Old Testament, University of Gloucester - Established IVP author"There has been plenty of interest in the book of Daniel on the part of commentators over the past generation or two.

(Daniel Block, Professor of Old Testament, Wheaton College)<br><br>"Evangelical Old Testament study has made huge strides in the second half of the twentieth century. Tyndale House in the U.K. and IVP internationally were central to that renaissance. And now at the start of the twenty-first century the Apollos Old Testament Commentary Series will build on that foundation as it showcases some of the best contemporary Old Testament interpretation. This series rightly insists on rigorous scholarship but always in the service of the theology and message of the books of the Old Testament.

Visit her at MaryAliceMonroe.com and at Facebook.com/MaryAliceMonroe.The Summer Girls CHAPTER ONE<p></p> <br><br> LOS ANGELES<p></p> <br>Carson was sorting through the usual boring bills and circulars in the mail when her fingers paused at the thick ecru envelope with Miss Carson Muir written in a familiar blue script. She clutched the envelope tight and her heart pumped fast as she scurried up the hot cement steps back to her apartment. The air-conditioning was broken, so only scarce puffs of breeze that carried noise and dirt from the traffic wafted through the open windows. It was a tiny apartment in a two-story stucco building near L.A., but it was close to the ocean and the rent was affordable, so Carson had stayed for three years, longer than she&#x2019;d ever lived in any other apartment.<br> <br>Carson carelessly tossed the other mail onto the glass cocktail table, stretched her long limbs out on the nubby brown sofa, then slid her finger along the envelope&#x2019;s seal. Waves of anticipation crested in her bloodstream as she slowly pulled out the navy-trimmed, creamy stationery card. Immediately she caught a whiff of perfume&#x2014;soft sweet spices and orange flowers&#x2014;and, closing her eyes, she saw the Atlantic Ocean, not the Pacific, and the white wooden house on pilings surrounded by palms and ancient oaks. A smile played on her lips. It was so like her grandmother to spray her letters with scent. So old world&#x2014;so Southern.<br> <br>Carson nestled deeper in the cushions and relished each word of the letter. When finished, she looked up and stared in a daze at the motes of dust floating in a shaft of sunlight. The letter was an invitation . . . was it possible?<br> <br>In that moment, Carson could have leaped to her feet and twirled on her toes, sending her long braid flying like that of the little girl in her memories. Mamaw was inviting her to Sullivan&#x2019;s Island. A summer at Sea Breeze. Three whole rent-free months by the sea!<br> <br>Mamaw always had the best timing, she thought, picturing the tall, elegant woman with hair the color of sand and a smile as sultry as a lowcountry sunset. It had been a horrid winter of endings. The television series Carson had been working on had been canceled without warning after a three-year run. Her cash flow was almost gone and she was just trying to figure out how she could make next month&#x2019;s rent. For months she&#x2019;d been bobbing around town looking for work like a piece of driftwood in rough waters.<br> <br>Carson looked again at the letter in her hand. &#x201c;Thank you, Mamaw,&#x201d; she said aloud, feeling it deeply. For the first time in months Carson felt a surge of hope. She paced a circle, her fingers flexing, then strode to the fridge and pulled out a bottle of wine and poured herself a mugful. Next she crossed the room to her small wood desk, pushed the pile of clothing off the chair, then sat down and opened her laptop.<br> <br>To her mind, when you were drowning and a rope was thrown your way, you didn&#x2019;t waste time thinking about what to do. You just grabbed it, then kicked and swam like the devil to safety. She had a lot to do and not much time if she was going to be out of the apartment by the month&#x2019;s end.<br> <br>Carson picked up the invitation again, kissed it, then put her hands on the keys and began typing. She would accept Mamaw&#x2019;s invitation. She was going back to the lowcountry&#x2014;to Mamaw. Back to the only place in the world she&#x2019;d ever thought of as home.<br> <br><br> SUMMERVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA<p></p> <br>Dora stood at the kitchen stove stirring a red sauce. It was 5:35 P.M. and the rambling Victorian house felt empty and desolate. She used to be able to set a clock by her husband&#x2019;s schedule. Even now, six months after Calhoun had left, Dora expected him to walk through the door carrying the mail. She&#x2019;d lift her cheek toward the man who had been her husband for fourteen years to receive his perfunctory kiss.<br> <br>Dora&#x2019;s attention was caught by the sound of pounding footfalls on the stairs. A moment later, her son burst into the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;I made it to the next level,&#x201d; he announced. He wasn&#x2019;t smiling, but his eyes sparkled with triumph.<br> <br>Dora smiled into his face. Her nine-year-old son made up her world. A big task for such a small boy. Nate was slight and pale, with furtive eyes that always made her wonder why her little boy was afraid. Of what? she&#x2019;d asked his child psychiatrist, who had smiled kindly. &#x201c;Nate isn&#x2019;t so much afraid as he is guarded,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d answered reassuringly. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t take it personally, Mrs. Tupper.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nate had never been a cuddly baby, but she worried when his smiling stopped after a year. By two, he didn&#x2019;t establish eye contact or turn his head when called. By three, he no longer came to her for comfort when he was hurt, nor did he notice or care if she cried or got angry. Except if she yelled. Then Nate covered his ears and commenced rocking in a panic.<br> <br>Her every instinct had screamed that something was wrong with her baby and she began furtively reading books on child development. How many times had she turned to Cal with her worries that Nate&#x2019;s speech development was behind the norm and that his movements were clumsy? And how many times had Cal turned on her, adamant that the boy was fine and she was making it all up in her head? She&#x2019;d been like a turtle tucking her head in, afraid to go against him. Already the subject of Nate&#x2019;s development was driving a wedge between them. When Nate turned four, however, and began flapping his hands and making odd noises, she made her first, long-overdue appointment with a child psychiatrist. It was then that the doctor revealed what Dora had long feared: her son had high-functioning autism.<br> <br>Cal received the diagnosis as a psychological death sentence. But Dora was surprised to feel relieved. Having an official diagnosis was better than making up excuses and coping with her suspicions. At least now she could actively help her son.<br> <br>And she did. Dora threw herself into the world of autism spectrum disorders. There was no point in gnashing her teeth wishing that she&#x2019;d followed up on her own instincts sooner, knowing now that early diagnosis and treatment could have meant important strides in Nate&#x2019;s development. Instead, she focused her energy on a support group and worked tirelessly to develop an intensive in-home therapy program. It wasn&#x2019;t long before her entire life revolved around Nate and his needs. All her plans for restoring her house fell by the wayside, as did hair appointments, lunches with friends, her size-eight clothes.<br> <br>And her marriage.<br> <br>Dora had been devastated when Cal announced seemingly out of the blue one Saturday afternoon in October that he couldn&#x2019;t handle living with her and Nate any longer. He assured her she would be taken care of, packed a bag, and walked out of the house. And that was that.<br> <br>Dora quickly turned off the stove and wiped her hands on her apron. She put on a bright smile to greet her son, fighting her instinct to lean over and kiss him as he entered the room. Nate didn&#x2019;t like being touched. She reached over to the counter to retrieve the navy-trimmed invitation that had arrived in the morning&#x2019;s mail.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a surprise for you,&#x201d; she told him with a lilt in her voice, feeling that the time was right to share Mamaw&#x2019;s summer plans.<br> <br>Nate tilted his head, mildly curious but uncertain. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>She opened the envelope and pulled out the card, catching the scent of her grandmother&#x2019;s perfume. Smiling with anticipation, Dora quickly read the letter aloud. When Nate didn&#x2019;t respond, she said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an invitation. Mamaw is having a party for her eightieth birthday.&#x201d;<br> <br>He immediately shrank inward. &#x201c;Do I have to go?&#x201d; he asked, his brow furrowed with worry.<br> <br>Dora understood that Nate didn&#x2019;t like to attend social gatherings, not even for people he loved, like his great-grandmother. Dora bent closer and smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just to Mamaw&#x2019;s house. You love going to Sea Breeze.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nate turned his head to look out the window, avoiding her eyes as he spoke. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like parties.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nor was he ever invited to any, she thought sadly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not really a party,&#x201d; Dora hastened to explain, careful to keep her voice upbeat but calm. She didn&#x2019;t want Nate to set his mind against it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only family coming&#x2014;you and me and your two aunts. We&#x2019;re invited to go to Sea Breeze for the weekend.&#x201d; A short laugh of incredulousness burst from her throat. &#x201c;For the summer, actually.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nate screwed up his face. &#x201c;For the summer?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nate, we always go to Sea Breeze to see Mamaw in July, remember? We&#x2019;re just going a little earlier this year because it is Mamaw&#x2019;s birthday. She will be eighty years old. It&#x2019;s a very special birthday for her.&#x201d; She hoped she&#x2019;d explained it clearly enough for him to work it out. Nate was extremely uncomfortable with change. He liked everything in his life to be in order. Especially now that his daddy had left.<br> <br>The past six months had been rocky for both of them. Though there had never been much interaction between Nate and his father, Nate had been extremely agitated for weeks after Cal moved out. He&#x2019;d wanted to know if his father was ill and had gone to the hospital. Or was he traveling on business like some of his classmates&#x2019; fathers? When Dora made it clear that his father was not ever returning to the house to live with them, Nate had narrowed his eyes and asked her if Cal was, in fact, dead. Dora had looked at Nate&#x2019;s taciturn face, and it was unsettling to realize that he wasn&#x2019;t upset at the possibility his father might be dead. He merely needed to know for certain whether Calhoun Tupper was alive or dead so that all was in order in his life. She had to admit that it made the prospect of a divorce less painful.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I go to Mamaw&#x2019;s house I will need to take my tetra,&#x201d; Nate told her at length. &#x201c;The fish will die if I leave it alone in the house.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dora slowly released her breath at the concession. &#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s a very good idea,&#x201d; she told him cheerfully. Then, because she didn&#x2019;t want him to dwell and because it had been a good day for Nate so far, she moved on to a topic that he wouldn&#x2019;t find threatening. &#x201c;Now, suppose you tell me about the new level of your game. What is your next challenge?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nate considered this question, then tilted his head and began to explain in tedious detail the challenges he faced in the game and how he planned to meet them.<br> <br>Dora returned to the stove, careful to mutter, &#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; from time to time as Nate prattled on. Her sauce had gone cold and all the giddiness that she&#x2019;d experienced when reading the invitation fizzled in her chest, leaving her feeling flat. Mamaw had been clear that this was to be a girls-only weekend. Oh, Dora would have loved a weekend away from the countless monotonous chores for a few days of wine and laughter, of catching up with her sisters, of being a Summer Girl again. Only a few days . . . Was that too much to ask?<br> <br>Apparently, it was. She&#x2019;d called Cal soon after the invitation had arrived.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Cal&#x2019;s voice rang in the receiver. &#x201c;You want me to babysit? All weekend?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dora could feel her muscles tighten. &#x201c;It will be fun. You never see Nate anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it won&#x2019;t be fun. You know how Nate gets when you leave. He won&#x2019;t accept me as your substitute. He never does.&#x201d;<br> <br>She could hear in his voice that he was closing doors. &#x201c;For pity&#x2019;s sake, Cal. You&#x2019;re his father. You have to figure it out!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Be reasonable, Dora. We both know Nate will never tolerate me or a babysitter. He gets very upset when you leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tears began to well in her eyes. &#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t bring him. It&#x2019;s a girls-only weekend.&#x201d; Dora lifted the invitation. &#x201c;It says, &#x2018;This invitation does not include husbands, beaus, or mothers.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>Cal snorted. &#x201c;Typical of your grandmother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cal, please . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see what the problem is,&#x201d; he argued, exasperation creeping into his voice. &#x201c;You always bring Nate along with you when you go to Sea Breeze. He knows the house, Mamaw . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But she said&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Frankly, I don&#x2019;t care what she said,&#x201d; Cal said, cutting her off. There was a pause, then he said with a coolness of tone she recognized as finality, &#x201c;If you want to go to Mamaw&#x2019;s, you&#x2019;ll have to bring Nate. That&#x2019;s all there is to it. Now good-bye.&#x201d;<br> <br>It had always been this way with Cal. He never sought to see all of Nate&#x2019;s positive qualities&#x2014;his humor, intelligence, diligence. Rather, Cal had resented the time she spent with their son and complained that their lives revolved around Nate and Nate alone. So, like an intractable child himself, Cal had left them both.<br> <br>Dora&#x2019;s shoulders slumped as she affixed Mamaw&#x2019;s invitation to the refrigerator door with a magnet beside the grocery list and a school photo of her son. In it, Nate was scowling and his large eyes stared at the camera warily. Dora sighed, kissed the photo, and returned to cooking their dinner.<br> <br>While she chopped onions, tears filled her eyes.<br> <br><br> NEW YORK CITY<p></p> <br>Harper Muir-James picked at the piece of toast like a bird. If she nibbled small pieces and chewed each one thoroughly, then sipped water between bites, she found she ate less. As she chewed, Harper&#x2019;s mind was working through the onslaught of emotions that had been roiling since she opened the invitation in the morning&#x2019;s mail. Harper held the invitation between her fingers and looked at the familiar blue-inked script.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mamaw,&#x201d; she whispered, the name feeling foreign on her lips. It had been so long since she&#x2019;d uttered the name aloud.<br> <br>She propped the thick card up against the crystal vase of flowers on the marble breakfast table. Her mother insisted that all the rooms of their prewar condo overlooking Central Park always have fresh flowers. Georgiana had grown up at her family estate in England, where this had been de rigueur. Harper&#x2019;s gaze lazily shifted from the invitation to the park outside her window. Spring had come to Central Park, changing the stark browns and grays of winter to an explosion of spring green. In her mind&#x2019;s eye, however, the scene shifted to the greening cordgrass in the wetlands of the lowcountry, the snaking creeks dotted with docks, and the large, waxy white magnolia blooms against glossy green leaves.<br> <br>Her feelings for her Southern grandmother were like the waterway that raced behind Sea Breeze&#x2014;deep, and swelling with happy memories. In the invitation Mamaw had referred to her &#x201c;Summer Girls.&#x201d; That was a term Harper hadn&#x2019;t heard&#x2014;had not even thought about&#x2014;in over a decade. She hadn&#x2019;t been but twelve years old when she spent her last summer at Sea Breeze. How many times had she seen Mamaw in all those years? It surprised Harper to realize it had been only three times.<br> <br>There had been so many invitations sent to her in those intervening years. So many regrets returned. Harper felt a twinge of shame as she pondered how she could have let so many years pass without paying Mamaw a visit.<br> <br>&#x201c;Harper? Where are you?&#x201d; a voice called from the hall.<br> <br>Harper coughed on a crumb of dry toast.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, there you are,&#x201d; her mother said, walking into the kitchen.<br> <br>Georgiana James never merely entered a room; she arrived. There was a rustle of fabric and an aura of sparks of energy radiating around her. Not to mention her perfume, which was like the blare of trumpets entering the room before her. As the executive editor of a major publishing house, Georgiana was always rushing&#x2014;to meet a deadline, to meet someone for lunch or dinner, or to another in a string of endless meetings. When...</p><h2>Haunted: A Novel of Stories</h2><p>&#34;Haunted&#34; is a novel made up of stories: twenty-three of them to be precise. Twenty-two of the most horrifying, hilarious, mind-blowing, stomach-churning tales you&#39;ll ever encounter - sometimes all at once. They are told by the people who have all answered the ad headlined &#39;Artists Retreat: Abandon your life for three months&#39;. They are led to believe that here they will leave behind all the distractions of &#39;real life&#39; that are keeping them from creating the masterpiece that is in them. But &#39;here&#39; turns out to be a cavernous and ornate old theatre where they are utterly isolated from the outside world - and where heat and power and, most importantly, food are in increasingly short supply. And the more desperate the circumstances become, the more desperate the stories they tell - and the more devious their machinations become to make themselves the hero of the inevitable play/movie/non-fiction blockbuster that will certainly be made from their plight. &#34;Haunted&#34; is at one level a satire of reality television. It draws from a great literary tradition - &#34;The Canterbury Tales&#34;, &#34;The Decameron&#34;, the English storytellers in the Villa Diodati who produced, among other works, &#34;Frankenstein&#34; - to tell an utterly contemporary tale of people desperate that their story be told at any cost. Appallingly entertaining, &#34;Haunted&#34; is Chuck Palahniuk at his finest - which means his most extreme and his most provocative.</p><p>Chuck Palahniuk is the bestselling author of fifteen fictional works, including Fight Club, Invisible Monsters, Survivor, Choke, Lullaby, Diary, Haunted, Rant, Pygmy, Tell-All, Damned, Doomed, Beautiful You, and most recently Make Something Up. He lives in the Pacific Northwest.Guinea Pigs<br>This was supposed to be a writers' retreat. It was supposed to be safe.<br>An isolated writers' colony, where we could work,<br>run by an old, old, dying man named Whittier,<br>until it wasn't.<br>And we were supposed to write poetry. Pretty poetry.<br>This crowd of us, his gifted students,<br>locked away from the ordinary world for three months.<br>And we called each other the "Matchmaker." And the "Missing Link."<br>Or "Mother Nature." Silly labels. Free-association names.<br>The same way--when you were little--you invented names for the plants and<br>animals in your world. You called peonies--sticky with nectar and crawling with<br>ants--the "ant flower." You called collies: Lassie Dogs.<br>But even now, the same way you still call someone "that man with one leg."<br>Or, "you know, the black girl . . ."<br>We called each other:<br>The "Earl of Slander."<br>Or "Sister Vigilante."<br>The names we earned, based on our stories. The names we gave each other,<br>based on our life instead of our family:<br>"Lady Baglady."<br>"Agent Tattletale."<br>Names based on our sins instead of our jobs:<br>"Saint Gut-Free."<br>And the "Duke of Vandals."<br>Based on our faults and crimes. The opposite of superhero names.<br>Silly names for real people. As if you cut open a rag doll and found inside:<br>Real intestines, real lungs, a beating heart, blood. A lot of hot, sticky blood.<br>And we were supposed to write short stories. Funny short stories.<br>Too many of us, locked away from the world for one whole<br>spring, summer, winter, autumn--one whole season of that year.<br>It doesn't matter who we were as people, not to old Mr. Whittier.<br>But he didn't say this at first.<br>To Mr. Whittier, we were lab animals. An experiment.<br>But we didn't know.<br>No, this was only a writers' retreat until it was too late for us to be anything,<br>except his victims.<br><br>1.<br><br>When the bus pulls to the corner where Comrade Snarky had agreed to wait, she stands there in an army-surplus flak jacket--dark olive-green--and baggy camouflage pants, the cuffs rolled up to show infantry boots. A suitcase on either side of her. With a black beret pulled down tight on her head, she could be anyone.<br><br>"The rule was . . . ," Saint Gut-Free says into the microphone that hangs above his steering wheel.<br><br>And Comrade Snarky says, "Fine." She leans down to unbuckle a luggage tag off one suitcase. Comrade Snarky tucks the luggage tag in her olive-green pocket, then lifts the second suitcase and steps up into the bus. With one suitcase still on the curb, abandoned, orphaned, alone, Comrade Snarky sits down and says, "Okay."<br><br>She says, "Drive."<br><br>We were all leaving notes, that morning. Before dawn. Sneaking out on tiptoe with our suitcase down dark stairs, then along dark streets with only garbage trucks for company. We never did see the sun come up.<br><br>Sitting next to Comrade Snarky, the Earl of Slander was writing something in a pocket notepad, his eyes flicking between her and his pen.<br><br>And, leaning over sideways to look, Comrade Snarky says, "My eyes are <i>green</i>, not <i>brown</i>, and my hair is naturally this color <i>auburn</i>." She watches as he writes <i>green</i>, then says, "And I have a little red rose tattooed on my butt cheek." Her eyes settle on the silver tape recorder peeking out of his shirt pocket, the little-mesh microphone of it, and she says, "Don't write <i>dyed hair</i>. Women either <i>lift</i> or <i>tint</i> the color of their hair."<br><br>Near them sits Mr. Whittier, where his spotted, trembling hands can grip the folded chrome frame of his wheelchair. Beside him sits Mrs. Clark, her breasts so big they almost rest in her lap.<br><br>Eyeing them, Comrade Snarky leans into the gray flannel sleeve of the Earl of Slander. She says, "Purely ornamental, I assume. And of no nutritive value . . ."<br><br>That was the day we missed our last sunrise.<br><br>At the next dark street corner, where Sister Vigilante stands waiting, she holds up her thick black wristwatch, saying, "We agreed on four-thirty-five." She taps the watch face with her other hand, saying, "It is now four-thirty-nine . . ."<br><br>Sister Vigilante, she brought a fake-leather case with a strap handle, a flap that closed with a snap to protect the Bible inside. A purse handmade to lug around the Word of God.<br><br>All over the city, we waited for the bus. At street corners or bus-stop benches, until Saint Gut-Free drove up. Mr. Whittier sitting near the front with Mrs. Clark. The Earl of Slander. Comrade Snarky and Sister Vigilante.<br><br>Saint Gut-Free pulls the lever to fold open the door, and standing on the curb is little Miss Sneezy. The sleeves of her sweater lumpy with dirty tissues stuffed inside. She lifts her suitcase and it rattles loud as popcorn in a microwave oven. With every step up the stairs into the bus, the suitcase rattles loud as far-off machine-gun fire, and Miss Sneezy looks at us and says, "My pills." She gives the suitcase a loud shake and says, "A whole three months' supply . . ."<br><br>That's why the rule about only so much luggage. So we would all fit.<br><br>The only rule was one bag per person, but Mr. Whittier didn't say how big or what kind.<br><br>When Lady Baglady climbed on board, she wore a diamond ring the size of a popcorn kernel, her hand holding a leash, the leash dragging a leather suitcase on little wheels.<br><br>Waving her fingers to make her ring sparkle, Lady Baglady says, "It's my late husband, cremated and made into a three-carat diamond . . ."<br><br>At that, Comrade Snarky leans over the notepad where the Earl of Slander is writing, and she says, "<i>Facelift</i> is one word."<br><br>A few blocks later, after a couple traffic lights and around some corners waits Chef Assassin, carrying a molded aluminum suitcase with, inside, all his white elastic underpants and T-shirts and socks folded down to squares tight as origami. Plus a matched set of chef's knives. Under that, his aluminum suitcase is solid-packed with banded stacks of money, all of it hundred-dollar bills. All of it so heavy he used both hands to lift it into the bus.<br><br>Down another street, under a bridge and around the far side of a park, the bus pulled to the curb where no one seemed to wait. There the man we called the "Missing Link" stepped out of the bushes near the curb. Balled in his arms, he carried a black garbage bag, torn and leaking plaid flannel shirts.<br><br>Looking at the Missing Link, but talking sideways to the Earl of Slander, Comrade Snarky said, "His<i> beard</i> looks like something Hemingway might've shot . . ."<br><br>The dreaming world, they'd think we were crazy. Those people still in bed, they'd be asleep another hour, then washing their faces, under their arms, and between their legs, before going to the same work they did every day. Living that same life, every day.<br><br>Those people would cry to find us gone, but they would cry, too, if we were boarding a ship to start a new life across some ocean. Emigrating. Pioneers.<br><br>This morning, we were astronauts. Explorers. Awake while they slept.<br><br>These people would cry, but then they would go back to waiting tables, painting houses, programming computers.<br><br>At our next stop, Saint Gut-Free swung open the doors, and a cat ran up the steps and down the aisle between the seats of the bus. Behind the cat came Director Denial, saying, "His name is Cora." The cat's name was Cora Reynolds. "I didn't name him," said Director Denial, the tweed blazer and skirt she wore frosted with cat hair. One lapel swollen out from her chest.<br><br>"A shoulder holster," says Comrade Snarky, leaning close to tell the tape recorder in the Earl of Slander's shirt pocket.<br>All of this--whispering in the dark, leaving notes, keeping secret--it was our adventure.<br><br>If you were planning to be stranded on a desert island for three months, what would you bring along?<br><br>Let's say all your food and water would be provided, or so you think.<br><br>Let's say you can only bring along one suitcase because there will be a lot of you, and the bus taking you all to the desert island is only so big.<br><br>What would you pack in your suitcase?<br><br>Saint Gut-Free brought boxes of pork-rind snacks and dried cheese puffs, his fingers and chin orange with the salt dust. One bony hand gripping the steering wheel, he tilted each box to pour the snacks into his thin face.<br><br>Sister Vigilante brought a shopping bag of clothes with a satchel bag set in the top.<br><br>Leaning over her own huge breasts, holding them like a child in her arms, Mrs. Clark asked, did Sister Vigilante bring along a human head?<br><br>And Sister Vigilante opened the satchel far enough to show the three holes of a black bowling ball, saying, "My hobby . . ."<br><br>Comrade Snarky looks from the Earl of Slander scribbling into his notepad, then looks at Sister Vigilante's braided-tight black hair, not one strand pulling loose from its pins.<br><br>"<i>That</i>," Comrade Snarky says, "<i>is tinted hair</i>."<br><br>At our next stop, Agent Tattletale stood with a video camera held to one eye, filming the bus as it pulled to the curb. He brought a stack of business cards he passed out to prove he was a private detective. With his video camera held as a mask covering half his face, he filmed us, walking down the aisle to an empty seat at the back, blinding everyone with his spotlight.<br><br>A city block later, the Matchmaker climbed on board, tracking horse shit on his cowboy boots. A straw cowboy hat in his hands and a duffel bag hung over one shoulder, he sat and peeled back his window and spit brown tobacco juice down the brushed-steel side of the bus.<br><br>This is what we brought along for three months outside of the world. Agent Tattletale, his video camera. Sister Vigilante, her bowling ball. Lady Baglady, her diamond ring. This is what we'd need to write our stories. Miss Sneezy, her pills and tissues. Saint Gut-Free, his snack food. The Earl of Slander, his notebook and tape recorder.<br>Chef Assassin, his knives.<br><br>In the dim light of the bus, we all spied on Mr. Whittier, the workshop organizer. Our teacher. You could see the spotted shiny dome of his scalp under the few gray hairs combed across. The button-down collar of his shirt stood up, a starched white fence around his thin, spotted neck.<br><br>"The people you're sneaking away from," Mr. Whittier would say, "they don't want you enlightened. They want to know what to expect."<br><br>Mr. Whittier would tell you, "You cannot be the person they know and the great, glorious person you want to become. Not at the same time."<br><br>The people who really, actually loved us, Mr. Whittier said they'd beg us to go. To fulfill our dream. Practice our craft. And they would love us when we all came back.<br><br>In three months.<br><br>The little bit of life we'd each gamble.<br><br>We'd risk.<br><br>This much time, we'd bet on our own ability to create some masterpiece. A short story or poem or screenplay or memoir that would make sense of our life. A masterpiece that would buy our way out of slavery to a husband or a parent or a corporation. That would earn our freedom.<br><br>All of us, driving along the empty streets in the dark. Miss Sneezy fishes a damp tissue out of her sweater sleeve and blows her nose. She sniffs and says, "Sneaking out this way, I was so afraid of getting caught." Tucking the tissue back inside her cuff, she says, "I feel just like . . . Anne Frank."<br><br>Comrade Snarky digs the luggage tag out of her jacket pocket, the remains of her abandoned suitcase. Her abandoned life. And, turning the tag over and over in her hand, still looking at it, Comrade Snarky says, "The way I see it . . ." She says, "Anne Frank had life pretty good."<br><br>And Saint Gut-Free, his mouth full of corn chips, watching us all in the rearview mirror, chewing salt and fat, he says, "How's that?"<br><br>Director Denial pets her cat. Mrs. Clark pets her breasts. Mr. Whittier, his chrome wheelchair.<br><br>Under a streetlight, on a corner up ahead, the dark outline of another would-be writer waits.<br><br>"At least Anne Frank," Comrade Snarky said, "never had to tour with her book . . ."<br><br>And Saint Gut-Free hits the air brakes and cranks the steering wheel to pull over.<br>Landmarks<br><br><i>A Poem About Saint Gut-Free</i><br><br>"Here's the job I left to come here," the Saint says. "And the life I gave up."<br>He used to drive a tour bus.<br>Saint Gut-Free onstage, his arms folded across his chest--<br>so skinny<br>his hands can touch in the middle of his back<br>There stands Saint Gut-Free, with a single coat of skin <br>painted on his skeleton.<br>His collarbones loop out from his chest, big as grab <br>handles.<br>His ribs show through his white T-shirt, and his belt--<br>instead of his butt--keeps up his blue jeans.<br>Onstage, instead of a spotlight, a movie fragment:<br>the colors of houses and sidewalks, street signs and <br>parked cars,<br>wipe sideways across his face.

Debold <i>Middletown Press</i>)</p><h2>The Folded Earth: A Novel</h2><p><b>From the widely acclaimed author of <i>An Atlas of Impossible Longing</i>, a powerful and triumphantly beautiful novel set in contemporary India, about a young woman forging a new life in the foothills of the Himalayas. </b><br><br><b>LONGLISTED FOR THE 2011 MAN ASIAN LITERARY PRIZE </b><br><br><b>SHORTLISTED FOR <i>THE HINDU </i>LITERARY PRIZE FOR BEST FICTION 2011</b> <br><br>WITH HER DEBUT NOVEL, <i>An Atlas of Impossible Longing, </i>Anuradha Roy&#x2019;s exquisite storytelling instantly won readers&#x2019; hearts around the world, and the novel was named one of the best books of the year by <i>The Washington Post </i>and <i>The Seattle Times</i>. <br><br>Now, Roy has returned with another masterpiece that is already earning international prize attention, an evocative and deeply moving tale of a young woman making a new life for herself amid the foothills of the Himalaya. Desperate to leave a private tragedy behind, Maya abandons herself to the rhythms of the little village, where people coexist peacefully with nature. But all is not as it seems, and she soon learns that no refuge is remote enough to keep out the modern world. When power-hungry politicians threaten her beloved mountain community, Maya finds herself caught between the life she left behind and the new home she is determined to protect. <br><br>Elegiac, witty, and profound by turns, and with a tender love story at its core, <i>The Folded Earth </i>brims with the same genius and love of language that made <i>An Atlas of Impossible Longing </i>an international success and confirms Anuradha Roy as a major new literary talent.</p><p>Anuradha Roy is the author of <i>An Atlas of Impossible Longing</i> and <i>The Folded Earth</i>, as well as <i>Sleeping on Jupiter</i>, which won the DSC Prize for Fiction 2016 and was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize 2015. She lives in Ranikhet, India.one<br> <br>The girl came at the same hour, summer or winter. Every morning, I heard her approach. Plastic slippers, the clink of steel on stone. And then her footsteps, receding. That morning she was earlier. The whistling thrushes had barely cleared their throats, and the rifle range across the valley had not yet sounded its bugles. And, unlike every other day, I did not hear her leave after she had set down my daily canister of milk.<br> <br>She did not knock or call out. She was waiting. All went quiet in the blueness before sunlight. Then the soothing early morning mutterings of the neighborhood began: axes struck wood, dogs tried out their voices, a rooster crowed, wood-smoke crept in through my open window. My eyelids dipped again and I burrowed deeper into my blanket. I woke only when I heard the General walking his dog, reproaching it for its habitual disobedience, as if after all these years it still baffled him. &#x201c;What is the reason, Bozo?&#x201d; he said, in his loud voice. &#x201c;Bozo, what is the reason?&#x201d; He went past every morning at about six thirty, which meant that I was going to be late unless I ran all the way.<br> <br>I scrabbled around, trying to organize myself&#x2014;make coffee, ?nd the clothes I would wear to work, gather the account books I needed to take with me&#x2014;and the milk for my coffee billowed and foamed out of the pan and over the stove before I could reach it. The mess would have to wait. I picked up things, gulping my coffee in between. It was only when I was lacing my shoes, crouched one-legged by the front door, that I saw her out of the corner of an eye: Charu, waiting for me still, drawing circles at the foot of the steps with a bare toe.<br> <br>Charu, a village girl just over seventeen, lived next door. She had every hill person&#x2019;s high cheekbones and skin, glazed pink with sunburn. She would forget to comb her hair till late in the day, letting it hang down her shoulders in two disheveled braids. Like most hill people, she was not tall, and from the back she could be mistaken for a child, thin and small-boned. She wore hand-me-down salwar kameezes too big for her, and in place of a diamond she had a tiny silver stud in her nose. All the same, she exuded the reserve and beauty of a princess of Nepal&#x2014;even if it took her only a second to slide back into the awkward teenager I knew. Now, when she saw I was about to come out, she stood up in a hurry, stubbing her toe against a brick. She tried to smile through the pain as she mouthed an inaudible &#x201c;namaste&#x201d; to me.<br> <br>I realized then why she had waited so long for me. I ran back upstairs and picked up a letter that had come yesterday. It was addressed to me, but when I opened it, I had found it was for Charu. I stuffed it into my pocket and stepped out of the front door.<br> <br>My garden was just an unkempt patch of hillside, but it rippled with wild?owers on this blue and gold morning. Teacup-sized lilies charged out of rocks and drifting scraps of paper turned into white butter?ies when they came closer. Everything smelled damp, cool, and fresh from the light rain that had fallen at dawn, the ?rst after many hot days. I felt myself slowing down, the hurry draining away. I was late anyway. What difference did a few more minutes make? I picked a plum and ate it, I admired the butter?ies, I chatted of this and that with Charu.<br> <br>I said nothing of the letter. I felt a perverse curiosity about how she would tell me what she wanted. More than once, I heard her draw breath to speak, but she either thought better of it or came up with, &#x201c;It has rained after three weeks dry.&#x201d; And then, &#x201c;The monkeys ate all the peaches on our tree.&#x201d;<br> <br>I took pity on her and produced the letter from my pocket. It had my address and name, written in Hindi in a large, childish hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you want me to read it for you?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, alright,&#x201d; she said. She began to fiddle with a rose, as if the letter were not important, yet darted glances in its direction when she thought I was not looking. Her face was transformed by relief and happiness. &#x201c;My friend Charu,&#x201d; the letter said:<br> <br>How are you? How is your family? I hope all are well. I am well. Today is my tenth day in Delhi. From the first day I looked for a post office to buy an inland letter. It is hard to find places here. It is a very big city. It has many cars, autorickshaws, buses. Sometimes there are elephants on the street. This city is so crowded that my eyes cannot go beyond the next house. I feel as if I cannot breathe. It smells bad. I remember the smells of the hills. Like when the grass is cut. You cannot hear any birds here, or cows or goats. But the room Sahib has given me is good. It is above the garage for the car. It faces the street. When I am alone at the end of the day&#x2019;s cooking, I can look out at everything. I get more money now. I am saving for my sister&#x2019;s dowry and to pay off my father&#x2019;s loan. Then I can do my heart&#x2019;s desire. Send me a print of your palm in reply. That will be enough for me. I will write again.<br><br>Your friend.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is it from?&#x201d; I asked Charu. &#x201c;Do you know someone in Delhi, or is this a mistake?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s from a friend,&#x201d; she said. She would not meet my eyes. &#x201c;A girl. Her name is Sunita.&#x201d; She hesitated before adding: &#x201c;I told her to send my letters to you because&#x2014;the postman knows your house better.&#x201d; She turned away. She must have known how transparent was her lie.<br> <br>I handed her the letter. She snatched it and was halfway up the slope leading from my house to hers before I had closed my fist. &#x201c;I thought I taught you to say thank you,&#x201d; I called after her. She paused. The breeze ?uttered through her dupatta as she stood there, irresolute, then ran down the slope back to me. She spoke so quickly her words ran into each other: &#x201c;If I bring you extra milk every day . . . will you teach me how to read and write?&#x201d;</p><h2>Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World</h2><p>The author of Video Night in Kathmandu ups the ante on himself in this sublimely evocative and acerbically funny tour through the world&#39;s loneliest and most eccentric places. From Iceland to Bhutan to Argentina, Iyer remains both uncannily observant and hilarious.</p><p><b>Pico Iyer</b> has written nonfiction books on globalism, Japan, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, and forgotten places, and novels on Revolutionary Cuba and Islamic mysticism. He regularly writes about literature for&nbsp;<i>The New York Review of Books</i>;&nbsp;about travel for the&nbsp;<i>Financial Times</i>;&nbsp;and about global culture and the news for&nbsp;<i>Time</i>,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>, and magazines around the world.As he did in The Lady and the Monk (1991) and Video Night in Kathmandu (1988), Iyer again turns his attention to the quirky and the quixotic, this time in what he calls ``the et ceteras in the list of nations.'' Included in these ``lonely places'' are Iceland, Paraguay, Vietnam, Argentina, and Australia. Iyer confesses early on to a lifelong attraction to regions that in ``their very remoteness'' take on an ``air of haunted glamour.'' He doesn't necessarily mean geographically distant, though Bhutan and Patagonia are among his destinations. Rather, it's the psychological and economic isolation of these areas- -occasioned by, for example, lack of tourism and international investment--that intrigues the author. Iyer depicts with wonder and affection the varied idiosyncracies he encounters, studding his narrative with colorful, off-beat facts--e.g., that, by law, one evening each year the members of the Icelandic Parliament must speak in rhyme. Throughout, Iyer displays a winning, self- deprecatory humor. When a Cuban doctor asks him to touch his nose with his eyes closed, the author jokes, ``Luckily, it is a big target: I pass with flying colors.'' Iyer's also aware of the dichotomies that exist within the countries he visits. Vietnam, despite decades of war, is ``one of the gentlest and most peaceful countries I have ever seen.'' His comments on that nation's eagerness to enter the world economic market are revelatory and unexpected: ``It is impossible not to feel that Saigon, with its Ca-Li-Pho-Nia Ham-Bu-Go stores and its karaoke bars, its Chiclets and water ski clubs, its private Mercedeses and hustlers and `Atlanta Placons' baseball caps--Saigon, with its rogue economy--is the image of the country's future.'' Economically written yet immensely resonant: a funny, stimulating, eminently humane work, charming and instructive. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In <i>Ancient Wisdom and Modern Misconceptions</i> he shows how the physical sciences, freed from prevailing misconceptions, actually corroborate the traditional wisdom long thought to be dead. Basing himself in part upon epistemological considerations first enunciated by Sir Arthur Eddington, he shows that the so-called physical universe proves finally to be constructed by the strategies of the experimental physicist himself. Following this he delves into the foundations of astrophysics and planetary astronomy, and then proceeds to elucidate the concepts of Intelligent Design and vertical causation. He concludes by showing how Anthropic Coincidence should be rightly interpreted. <br><br>With equal mastery Smith presents the serious reader with glimpses of the perennial wisdom eclipsed since the Enlightenment, and shows that traditional cosmology, so far from being disqualified, actually provides the keys to an understanding of science itself. No one entering the fray of current debates regarding "science and religion" can afford to neglect the immense implications of this work by Wolfgang Smith.</p><p><b>Wolfgang Smith</b> graduated from Cornell University at age 18 with majors in physics, mathematics, and philosophy. After taking an M.S. in physics from Purdue and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia University, Smith held faculty positions at various universities, including M.I.T. and U.C.L.A. Meanwhile his dominant interest had shifted from the pursuit of science to its critique, a field in which he has become a leading figure."On the most essential points--burning questions concerned with biblical cosmology, heliocentrism, the nature of space and matter, the concept of a true causality, and other such fundamental topics--Wolfgang Smith shows how the conclusions of contemporary science cease to be incompatible with the affirmations of traditional cosmology. It would be hard to exaggerate the importance of such a work."--<b>Jean Borella</b>, author of <i>The Secret of the Christian Way</i><br><br>"Wolfgang Smith is as important a thinker as our times boast." --<b>Huston Smith</b>, author of <i>The World's Religions</i><br><br>"Here is that rare person who is equally at home with Eckhart and Einstein, Heraclitus and Heisenberg!" --<b>Harry Oldmeadow</b>, author of <i>Touchstones of the Spirit: Essays on Religion, Tradition &amp; Modernity</i></p><h2>The Red Threads of Fortune (The Tensorate Series, 2)</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Joyously wild stuff.

It argues that almost any material thing, when examined closely, can be a link between present and past.<br><br>The authors of this book pulled an astonishing array of materials out of storage--from a pencil manufactured by Henry David Thoreau to a bracelet made from iridescent beetles--in a wide range of Harvard University collections to mount an innovative exhibition alongside a new general education course. The exhibition challenged the rigid distinctions between history, anthropology, science, and the arts. It showed that object-centered inquiry inevitably leads to a questioning of categories within and beyond history.<br><br><em>Tangible Things</em> is both an introduction to the range and scope of Harvard's remarkable collections and an invitation to reassess collections of all sorts, including those that reside in the bottom drawers or attics of people's houses. It interrogates the nineteenth-century categories that still divide art museums from science museums and historical collections from anthropological displays and that assume history is made only from written documents. Although it builds on a larger discussion among specialists, it makes its arguments through case studies, hoping to simultaneously entertain and inspire. The twenty case studies take us from the Galapagos Islands to India and from a third-century Egyptian papyrus fragment to a board game based on the twentieth-century comic strip "Dagwood and Blondie." A companion website catalogs the more than two hundred objects in the original exhibition and suggests ways in which the principles outlined in the book might change the way people understand the tangible things that surround them.<br></p><p><br><strong>Laurel Thatcher Ulrich</strong> taught for fifteen years at University of New Hampshire before moving to Harvard in 1995.

A deeply original essayist, Lugones writes from her own perspective as an inhabitant of a number of different 'worlds.' Born in Argentina but living for a number of years in the United States, she sees herself as neither quite a U.S. citizen, nor quite an Argentine. An activist against the oppression of Latino/a people by the dominant U.S. culture, she is also an academic participating in the privileges of that culture. A lesbian, she experiences homophobia in both Anglo and Latino world. A woman, she moves uneasily in the world of patriarchy. Lugones writes out of multiple and conflicting subjectivities that shape her sense of who she is, resisting the demand for a unified self in light of her necessary ambiguities. Pilgrimages/Peregrinajes explores the possibility of deep coalition with other women of color, based on 'multiple understandings of oppressions and resistances'&#x2015;understandings whose logic she subjects to philosophical investigation.</p><p>Mar&#39;a Lugones is associate professor of Latin American and Caribbean studies at Binghamton University, SUNY.Lugones teaches us vigilance, tentativeness, acuity, and playfulness in remembering that we are different selves in different worlds of sense. (Margaret Urban Walker, Donald J. Schuenke Chair in Philosophy, Marquette University)<br><br>In <i>Pilgrimages/Peregrinajes</i>, Maria Lugones brilliantly intervenes at the level of meaning by offering a logic of resistance, giving words to what she learned in loving engagement with companion resistors. Asserting that as women of color we cannot stand on any ground that is not also a crossing, Lugones invites us to move across realities, bring our cultures into hybrid life, and shape ground together. <i>Pilgrimages/Peregrinajes</i> is a crucial epistemology of liberation, taking us further in an emancipatory direction. (Gloria E. Anzaldï¿½a, author of Borderlands/La Frontera)<br><br>Astounding conceptual innovations and distinct conceptual creations. (Sarah Lucia Hoagland <i>Off Our Backs: The Feminist NewsJournal</i>)<br><br>Maria Lugones's collection has been so eagerly awaited because of the uncompromising clarity with which she captures the suffocating logics of political and conceptual domination and her unmistakable conviction that creative resistance to such suffocation is made possible only in close company with others. <i>Pilgrimages/Peregrinajes</i> provides sustained and deeply loving instruction in how to rethink the very meanings of justice and agency.

In a series of highly accessible and closely argued essays, a team of internationally recognized scholars bring history and context to bear in their radically different analyses of iconic events, such as the deforestation of Easter Island, the cessation of the Norse colony in Greenland, the faltering of nineteenth-century China, the migration of ancestral peoples away from Chaco Canyon in the American southwest, the crisis and resilience of Lowland Maya kingship, and other societies that purportedly &#34;collapsed.&#34; Collectively, these essays demonstrate that resilience in the face of societal crises, rather than collapse, is the leitmotif of the human story from the earliest civilizations to the present. Scrutinizing the notion that Euro-American colonial triumphs were an accident of geography, Questioning Collapse also critically examines the complex historical relationship between race and political labels of societal &#34;success&#34; and &#34;failure.&#34;</p><p>Questioning Collapse challenges those scholars and popular writers who advance the thesis that societies - past and present - collapse because of behavior that destroyed their environments or because of overpopulation.

But what about those markets we might label noxious--markets in addictive drugs, say, or in sex? In <em>Why Some Things Should Not Be for Sale</em>, philosopher Debra Satz takes a penetrating look at those commodity exchanges that strike most of us as problematic. What considerations, she asks, ought to guide the debates about such markets? Satz contends that categories previously used by philosophers and economists are of limited use in addressing such markets because they are assumed to be homogenous. Accordingly, she offers a broader and more nuanced view of markets--one that goes beyond the usual discussions of efficiency and distributional equality--to show how markets shape our culture, foster or thwart human development, and create and support structures of power. Nobel Laureate Kenneth J. Arrow calls this book "a work that will have to be studied and taken account of by all those concerned by the role of the market as compared with other social mechanisms."<br></p><p><br><strong>Debra Satz</strong> is Marta Sutton Weeks Professor of Ethics in Society and Professor of Philosophy at Stanford University.<br><br>"A wonderfully lucid tour of the thinking on markets over the years by economists and philosophers, from Adam Smith through Ronald Dworkin. Her main focus is markets that almost all find offensive: child labor, sex, kidneys. But the lessons she draws from them raise hard questions about the markets for health care, education, and maybe even credit derivatives." --<em>Harvard Business Review</em> <br><br><p></p><br>"Satz here provides a rigorous analysis of the relation between morality and the role of markets. Satz's contributions will be useful for a wide range of scholars concerned with ethics, moral theory, and economics. Highly recommended." --<em>CHOICE</em> <br><br><p></p><br>"Why not put everything up for sale--shoes and sex, cars and kidneys, blackberries and babies? Drawing on history and philosophy, economics and sociology, <em>Why Some Things Should Not Be For Sale</em> presents a powerful defense of a bracing answer to this question. According to Debra Satz, we can have markets for everything or we can have a democratic society, but we cannot have both. Satz's argument is subtle, rich, and complex, but in the end, the choice she presents us with is that simple."--Joshua Cohen, Stanford University <br><br><p></p><br>"This is a major accomplishment, and a compelling study for everyone interested in exploring the moral limits of markets. Satz seamlessly integrates moral reflection with concrete studies of how specific markets actually work. She provides an outstanding model of how empirically responsible moral inquiry should be conducted."--Elizabeth Anderson, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor <br><br><p></p><br>"In the modern world markets are central to our lives. We sell our labor and buy the goods and services we want. Markets can lead to economically efficient outcomes that could not be reached by other means. But markets have their limits. As Debra Satz points out, we reject markets in child labor, organs, votes or human beings, among other things. Sometimes we reject markets because they are inefficient. But, Satz argues, efficiency is not the only value in play, for markets affect 'who we are, how we relate to each other and what sort of society we can have.' Markets, Satz, demonstrates, are far too important to be left to economists. In this masterful work, the culmination of many years of thought, Satz provides a highly original framework to assist our reflections on which markets are beneficial and which, as she puts, it are 'noxious'."--Jonathan Wolff, Professor of Philosophy, University College London <br><br><p></p><br>"Our intuitive reaction that there are some trades that should not be made has received little understanding from economic analysis. Satz has greatly clarified the issues by making clear the social role that markets play, both in their own performance and in their consequences. She is discriminating in her analysis, pointing out the markets may sometimes contribute to the achievement of broader social values and better interactions while at other times they may reinforce bad consequences. This is a work that will have to be studied and taken account of by all those concerned by the role of the market as compared with other social mechanisms."--Kenneth J.

What happened to making yourself and your family filthy rich? Could I possibly be aiming any lower? Have things really gotten so bad that you should drop all your hopes and dreams and just struggle to stay solvent?</p><p>Absolutely not. But before you can get ahead, you have to get back to even, and in difficult times that's the hardest and most important goal of all. For the last eighteen months we've watched in excruciating horror as first our homes and then our stocks have plummeted in value. Make no mistake, the stock market crashed in the second half of 2008, and this was a crash to rival anything we've seen since the Great Depression. It was the worst year for stocks since 1931. In 2008, Americans lost more than a quarter of their retirement savings in 401(k) and IRA plans, and millions more saw their retirement funds cut in half. For many of you, it's as though your money simply vanished into thin air. I'm here to show you how to get it back, one dollar at a time.</p><p>Ever since the housing bubble went bust and the stock market fell apart like a wet paper bag, we've been deluged with books that promise to help you weather the downturn and get back on your feet. But most of them either offer up the same old tired and often discredited teachings wrapped in a new, panic-filled package -- sell all stocks now and cut up those nasty credit cards -- or are full of advice that could have saved you a lot of pain if the books had been written two years ago. Wonderful timing. That's not what you'll find in this book. Hindsight is twenty-twenty, but you need foresight if you're trying to rebuild your savings, and especially if you're trying to claw your way back from the ground up.</p><p>I can teach you how to protect your money in a downturn. I know how to avoid a stock market crash and even how to take advantage of one. I was entirely in cash for the crash of 1987, and in fact that's actually what put me on the map professionally in the early days of running my hedge fund and allowed me to pulverize the market in the fastest decline from peak to trough in history. I also hope that if you read and followed the advice in my earlier books <i>Real Money, Mad Money</i>, and <i>Stay Mad For Life</i>, you were able to escape the worst of the carnage. But the sad truth is that other than gold, which does well in chaotic times, and U.S. Treasurys, the safest of securities, every single asset class from stocks to corporate municipal and mortgage bonds to commodities has just been hammered. Stocks took an especially severe beating that they've only just begun to recover from. In 2008, the two most important bellwether indices that track the health of the overall market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the much broader Standard and Poor's 500, fell by 33.8 percent and 38.49 percent, respectively. The damage has already been done, the money's been lost, and none of these new books filled with old boilerplate bromides about investing will help you get it back. Most of what you'll find on the personal finance and investing shelves is authors giving you an ounce of prevention, when what you really need is a pound of cure. But then again, they are just writers who have never managed money, not even in a bull market, let alone the vicious bear that romped through Wall Street, eating up and crushing the defenseless eggs that you thought were safe in your nest.</p><p>Anyone can see that these aren't ordinary times. This is still a moment of financial crisis, and I'm not just talking about the mess that Wall Street got itself into or the near collapse of our banking system. I mean the individual financial crises that millions of Americans are dealing with every single day: how to keep your home, how to pay for college when the college fund's gone dry, how to retire when your retirement money's been wiped out. This is the cash you were counting on, and rebuilding it is our first priority.</p><p>This book is your financial first-aid kit, an emergency room for your portfolio complete with epinephrine shots and paddles -- think "Clear!" -- to bring your pocketbook back to life. I can help you stop the bleeding and start putting your financial life back together. The new strategies, rules, and disciplines in this book will help you hang on to what you have and rebuild everything you've lost.</p><p>It won't be simple or quick or easy. I'm not making any false promises here. But the good news is that it can be done, that you can exercise some control over your financial future. Whenever we're in dire economic straits it's all too easy to fall prey to the belief that nothing can be done to make things better. Millions of Americans are losing their homes, their jobs, and their savings, not because of anything they did but because a relatively small number of people in the financial industry made bad decisions while the government was asleep at the wheel or worse, promoting the reckless driving that got us into this mess. We're all at the mercy of forces beyond our control, to some extent or another, but that's no reason to throw up your hands and stop trying. The absolute worst thing you can do is get caught like a deer in headlights and turn yourself into a pure victim of circumstance.</p><p>On the other hand, you have to recognize that this isn't business as usual. If you've lost lots of money that you need, then the stakes have never been higher, both for you and for your family. So how the heck do you deal with that kind of crisis? I can tell you the specifics, new investing strategies that incorporate everything we've learned about what works and what doesn't from the crash and its aftermath, and how you should vary your approach depending on your age. But first you need to make sure you're on an even keel.</p><p>Everyone remembers that famous quotation from Franklin Roosevelt's first inaugural address, "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself," but you hardly ever hear the rest of that sentence, the most important part, expanding on this fear: "nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror, which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance." Now, obviously, if you've just had your retirement fund shredded or are in danger of losing your house, you have more to fear than fear itself. Fear is a great motivator but not when it paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. We've been through nasty recessions before, and believe it or not, it's possible to overcome the problems they create for you personally, and even to profit from the broader crisis and come out wealthier than ever. But to do that, you have to recognize that in extraordinarily difficult times, the stock market doesn't always operate according to ordinary rules. However, there are new rules, and rules I have pioneered to help you navigate your way through these brutal times. I can teach you how to learn from and play by these new rules and win while everyone else is trying to show you how to avoid a crash that already happened.</p><p>Why should you listen to me, and what makes this book so different from the standard fare? I'm a stock guy after all, and aren't stocks what got us into this mess in the first place? Look, I have been at this for thirty years. Unlike the usual peddlers of financial advice, I actually made myself rich by investing in the stock market and managing the money of my wealthy clients at my old hedge fund, Cramer Berkowitz &amp; Company, including cleaning up during the devastating crash of 2000, when my fund was up 36 percent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average took a 6.18 percent hit, the S&amp;P 500 fell by 9.1 percent, and the NASDAQ plummeted 39.29 percent. I know how to make money in bear markets and during recessions. But beyond that, I've also been where you are right now. I know what it's like to lose a vast amount of money in a short period of time. I know how it feels to have my very future on the line. I understand the stress and the fear, but I also understand how to come back.</p><p>I still keep a memento of one of the lowest points in my life tucked into my wallet, and carry it with me wherever I go. It's a little piece of paper, a cutout from my daily portfolio run on the single worst day my hedge fund ever had, October 8, 1998, a date that, at least for me, will live in infamy. With less than three months left until the end of the year, my hedge fund, which was supposed to be managing $281 million, at the time was down $90,915,674 or 32 percent, because I'd made a series of boneheaded bets in the market. That's the kind of loss that would destroy most hedge funds, like the hundreds of funds that were brought low by 2008. It wasn't just my money that was at risk, it was my job and my entire career, too, not to mention my reputation, as virtually everyone I knew had written me off as a failure. Even <i>The New York Times</i> had written my premature financial obituary.</p><p>I was in the very same position that most of you are probably in right now. My investments had cratered and my future was in jeopardy. Practically everyone around me urged me to quit and head for the hills, wherever the hills might be, since I live in a Jersey suburb of New York City. So you see, I know exactly how you feel. But I'm not telling you this to show that I feel your pain. Empathy is great, but it won't make you money. You need concrete solutions and this book is filled with them.</p><p>Between October 8, that dark day when I was down almost $91 million, and the end of the year, I did what I'm going to teach you to do in this book. I got back to even, and actually finished the year with a small profit of 2 percent. I buckled down and in less than three months I made back $110 million, averaging $1.4 million in profits every single day. Not only is it possible to come back from devastating losses, but also, if you're lucky, you can even do it quickly. Now, in one respect you're in a much better position than I was in 1998: you don't have to worry about arbitrary time constraints the way a hedge fund manager does. No clients are trying to pull out money while you try to rebuild your capital, nor is anyone even looking...</p></p><h2>Eminent Victorians (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)</h2><p><b>A genre-changing work of biography</b><br><br><i>Eminent Victorians</i> marked an epoch in the art of biography; it also helped to crack the old myths of high Victorianism and to usher in a new spirit by which chauvinism, hypocrisy and the stiff upper lip were debunked. In it, Strachey cleverly exposes the self-seeking ambitions of Cardinal Manning and the manipulative, neurotic Florence Nightingale; and in his essays on Dr Arnold and General Gordon, his quarries are not only his subjects but also the public-school system and the whole structure of nineteenth-century liberal values.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>The four biographical essays that make up <i>Eminent Victorians</i> created something of a stir when they were first published in the spring of 1918, bringing their author instant fame. In his flamboyant collection, Lytton Strachey chose to stray far from the traditional mode of biography: "Those two fat volumes, with which it is our custom to commemorate the dead--who does not know them, with their ill-digested masses of material, their slipshod style, their tone of tedious panegyric, their lamentable lack of selection, of detachment, of design?" Instead he provided impressionistic but acute (and, some said, skewed) portraits. Rarely does Strachey explore the details of a subject's daily or family life unless they point directly to an issue of character. In short, he pioneered a deeply sardonic and often scathingly funny biographical style. <p> None of Strachey's Victorians emerge unscathed. In his hands, Florence Nightingale is not a gentle archangel descended from heaven to minister sweetly to wounded soldiers, but rather an exacting, dictatorial, and judgmental crusader. Her "pen, in the virulence of its volubility, would rush ... to the denunciation of an incompetent surgeon or the ridicule of a self-sufficient nurse. Her sarcasm searched the ranks of the officials with the deadly and unsparing precision of a machine-gun. Her nicknames were terrible. She respected no one." Dr. Thomas Arnold, the man appointed to revamp the very private British public school system, fares little better: in Strachey's acid ink, he became "the founder of the worship of athletics and the worship of good form." In this same vain, military hero General Gordon is portrayed as a temperamental, irascible hermit, occasionally drunk and often found in the company of young boys--a man who tended to forget and forgo the tenets found in the Bible he kept with him always. And the powerful and popular Cardinal Manning, who came within a hair's breadth of succeeding Pope Pius IX, belonged, Strachey writes, "to that class of eminent ecclesiastics ... who have been distinguished less for saintliness and learning than for practical ability."</p><p> As he offered up indelible sketches of his less-than-fab four, Strachey was intent on critiquing established mores. This effortlessly superior wit knew full well that deep convictions and good deeds often go hand in hand with hypocrisy, arrogance, and egomania. His task was to pique those who pretended they did not. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>I Love Female Orgasm: An Extraordinary Orgasm Guide</h2><p>Whether you're celebrating your thousandth female orgasm, searching for your first, or cheering on your girlfriend or wife, women and men across the country agree: <i>I Love Female Orgasm!</i><i><br></i><i><br></i><i>I Love Female Orgasm</i> is crammed with everything you want to know about the big O, including: <br><ul><li>How to have an orgasm during intercourse--and why most women don't </li><li>Directions on finding your way to the G-spot </li><li>Detailed advice on how to have your first orgasm </li><li>Advice for better oral sex </li><li>Tips on surfing waves of multiple orgasms (even if you usually have just one) </li><li>The truth about female ejaculation (yes, it exists!) </li><li>Answers to your questions about vibrators, sex toys, piercings, and more </li><li>The real deal on orgasms for lesbian, bisexual, and queer women</li><li>An entire chapter for men on how to turn her on and get her off</li><li>Plus tips for partners in every chapter </li></ul><br>Solot and Miller have spoken to thousands of men and women and surveyed thousands more about their experiences with female orgasm.

Are its documents historically reliable? Are its teachings relevant in the twenty-first century? These are important questions for all who believe that Christianity is a religion founded on events that took place in space-time history, indeed for all who care about truth and meaning in life. In this thought-provoking book Walter C. Kaiser Jr. makes the case that the Old Testament documents are both historically reliable <em>and</em> personally and socially relevant. He begins by looking at the origins of the Old Testament books and how well their texts were preserved. Next he explores Old Testament history, giving close attention to the book of Genesis, the patriarchal narratives, and the chronicles of the kings of Judah and Israel. He then surveys the larger questions of the trustworthiness and authority of the various Old Testament genres: historical narrative, wisdom and prophecy. Lastly, Kaiser probes the relevance of the Old Testament for Christian faith today. And in an epilogue he asks--and answers--the question "What is the Old Testament all about?" Here is a helpful, even essential, book to help you face the challenges of reading and applying the Old Testament in today's world.</p><p>Kaiser is Colman M. Mockler Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Old Testament and president emeritus of Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. For many years he served as professor of Old Testament and as dean and vice president for education at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (Deerfield, Illinois). A frequent speaker at churches, camps and conferences, he has written numerous books, including <em>Toward an Exegetical Theology, Toward an Old Testament Theology, Toward Old Testament Ethics</em> and <em>The Messiah in the Old Testament.</em></p><h2>Twelve Transgressions: Avoiding common roadblocks on your journey to Christlikeness</h2><p>Avoid spiritual trip wires that can cause you to stumble!Christians--even leaders with good intentions--commit transgressions that can have a devastating ripple effect, releasing poisons within marriages, families, careers and the body of Christ.

Erdosain wanders the crowded, confusing streets of Buenos Aires, thronging with immigrants almost as displaced and alienated as he is, and finds himself among a group of conspirators who are in thrall to a man known simply as the Astrologer. The Astrologer has the cure for everything that ails civilization. Unemployment will be cured by mass enslavement. (Mountains will be hollowed out and turned into factories.)

Raised in tenement housing, Arlt was the only surviving sibling of three. Although his mother read him Dante and Tasso from an early age, Arlt was expelled from elementary school at age eight. Seeking to escape his austere and abusive father, and under the sway of Baudelaire&#x2014;a self-proclaimed &#x201c;spiritual father&#x201d;&#x2014;Arlt ran away from home at sixteen and began working odd jobs to support himself as a writer. He published his first novel, <i>The Mad Toy</i>, in 1926. <i>The Seven Madmen</i>, which Arlt considered his masterpiece, and its sequel, <i>The Flamethrowers</i>, followed in 1929 and 1931. In the 1930s, Arlt came to prominence as a journalist; he was probably best known for his column <i>Aguafuertes porteï¿½as</i> (Etchings of Buenos Aires).

As he works alone in her isolated house, Kipps begins to uncover disturbing secrets - and his unease grows when he glimpses a mysterious woman dressed in black. The locals are strangely unwilling to talk about the unsettling occurrence, and Kipps is forced to uncover the true identity of the Woman in Black on his own, leading to a desperate race against time when he discovers her true intent...</p></p><p>What real reader does not yearn, somewhere in the recesses of his or her heart, for a really literate, first-class thriller -- one that chills the body, but warms the soul with plot, perception, and language at once astute and vivid? In other words, a ghost story written by Jane Austen? <p>Alas, we cannot give you Austen, but Susan Hill's remarkable <i>Woman in Black</i> comes as close as our era can provide. Set on the obligatory English moor, on an isolated causeway, the story has as its hero Arthur Kipps, an up-and-coming young solicitor who has come north from London to attend the funeral and settle the affairs of Mrs. Alice Drabow of Eel Marsh House. The routine formalities he anticipates give way to a tumble of events and secrets more sinister and terrifying than any nightmare: the rocking chair in the deserted nursery, the eerie sound of a pony and trap, a child' scream in the fog, and most dreadfully -- and for Kipps most tragically -- <i>The Woman in Black.</i> </p><p><i>The Woman in Black</i> is both a brilliant exercise in atmosphere and controlled horror and a delicious spine-tingler -- proof positive that this neglected genre, the ghost story, isn't dead after all.</p>Set in Victorian England, Arthur Kipps, a junior solicitor in London, is summoned to Crythin Gifford to attend the funeral of Mrs Alice Drablow, and to sort through her papers before returning to London. It is here that Kipps first sees the woman in black and begins to gain an impression of the mystery surrounding her. From the funeral he travels to Eel Marsh House and sees the woman again, plus he also hears the terrifying sounds of adult and child passengers sinking into the quicksand on a pony and trap. <br> <br>Despite Kipps?s experiences he resolves to spend the night at the house and fulfil hi professional duty.It is this night at Eel Marsh House that contains the greatest horror for Kipps. Rescued by Mr Daily, a friend he met on the train, Kipps discovers the reasons behind the hauntings at Eel Marsh House. The book ends with tragedy, with the woman in black exacting a final, terrible revenge.</p><h2>Trickster Feminism (Penguin Poets)</h2><p><b>New from celebrated poet and performer Anne Waldman - an edgy, visionary collection that meditates on gender, existence, passion and activism</b><br><br>Mythopoetics, shape shifting, quantum entanglement, Anthropocene blues, litany and chance operation play inside the field of these intertwined poems, which coalesced out of months of protests with some texts penned in the streets. Anne Waldman looks to the imagination of mercurial possibility, to the spirits of the doorway and of crossroads, and to language that jolts the status quo of how one troubles gender and outwits patriarchy. She summons Tarot's Force Arcana, the passion of the suffragettes, and various messengers and heroines of historical, hermetic, and heretical stance, creating an intersectionality of lived experience: class, sexuality, race, politics all enter the din. These are experiments of survival.</p><p>Anne Waldman is a revered poet, performer, professor, editor and cultural activist. She is the author of more than forty-five books, including <i>Gossamurmur, Manatee/Humanity, Structure of the World Compared to a Bubble</i>, and the feminist epic <i>The Iovis Trilogy</i>, which won the 2012 PEN Center USA Award for poetry. The recipient of the Poetry Society of America's Shelley Memorial Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Before Columbus Foundation's Lifetime Achievement Award, Waldman makes her home in New York City and in Boulder Colorado, where she is a Distinguished Professor of Writing and Poetics and Artistic Director of the Summer Writing Program at Naropa University.trick o&#x2019; death<br><br>when you are sitting<br>with the corpse of your friend<br>this is what to do<br>when what do you do<br><br>if you are strong<br>make a binding of your mind<br>surface the body<br>breathe in quick breaths<br><br>huff!

In the superheated global village of the near future, big money is made by finding the right little war and supporting one side against the other&#x2013;in exchange for a share of the spoils. To succeed, Shorn uses a new kind of corporate gladiator: sharp-suited, hard-driving gunslingers who operate armored vehicles and follow a Samurai code. And Chris Faulkner is just the man for the job.<br><br>He fought his way out of London&#x2019;s zone of destitution. And his kills are making him famous. But unlike his best friend and competitor at Shorn, Faulkner has a side that outsiders cannot see: the side his wife is trying to salvage, that another woman&#x2013;a porn star turned TV news reporter&#x2013;is trying to exploit. Steeped in blood, eyed by common criminals looking for a shot at fame, Faulkner is living on borrowed time. Until he&#x2019;s given one last shot at getting out alive. . . .</p><p>Richard Morgan, the award-winning author of <i>Altered Carbon</i> and <i>Broken Angels</i>, strikes out into new territory with <i>Market Forces</i>, leaving behind the farflung battlegrounds of Takeshi Kovacs for the not-so-distant future of corporate Earth. Here, Morgan extrapolates a world where commodities trading reaches a brutal pitch and the outcomes of banana republic uprisings are the new market. Now, on the road to success, the brokers of the new economy compete for status and promotions via road rage on the freeways of new London. <p> Morgan's conflicted protagonist, Chris Faulkner, is a comer known for one spectacular kill that shot him to the top of mid-range global capital firm. He parlays his reputation and skills as a driver into a job in the emerging field of "Conflict Investment" at the world's hottest and hardest firm. Soon he finds himself running with the big dogs and rises to the top of a brutal realm, but his ascent is quickly threatened by vicious senior partners, gold-digging suitors, fame, fair-weather friends, and his own nagging conscience. </p><p> <i>Market Forces</i> is at once an anti-globalization treatise and anime fantasy meets <i>The Road Warrior</i>. Morgan employs the graphic-novel imagery of his two previous novels to create a disturbingly brutal picture of slash-and-burn capitalism run amok.

Invited to give the prestigious 2014 Gifford Lectures, Dr Williams has produced a scholarly but eminently accessible account of the possibilities of speaking about God &#x2013; taking as his point of departure the project of natural theology. Dr Williams enters into dialogue with thinkers as diverse as Augustine and Simone Weil and authors such as Joyce, Hardy, Burgess and Hoban in what is a compelling essay about the possibility of language about God.</p></p><p><p>The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Williams has held prestigious chairs at both Oxford and at Cambridge University. He has published a number of important and influential books including <i>The Wound of Knowledge</i>, <i>Lost Icons</i> and<i> Faith in the Public Square</i>, his last book as Archbishop.</p>This is not a long book but it is a profound one.

Vernon K. Robbins here provides an accessible introduction to socio-rhetorical criticism, illustrating the method by guiding the reader through the study of specific New Testament texts and stories.An opening chapter outlines this new approach and its focus on values, convictions, and beliefs both in the texts we read and in the world in which we live. Then follow chapters on getting inside a text (inner texture), that is, studying the internal aspects of words and meanings in the text: entering the interactive world of the test (intertexture,), that is relating the text being interpreted to a wide range of phenomena that lie outside the text: living with the text in the world (social and cultural texture), that is, examining the social and cultural locations in the world that the language of the text evokes: and shared interests in commentary and in the text (ideological texture), that is, looking at the way the text itself and interpreters of the text position themselves in relation to other individuals and groups.Texts studied include the rich man and Jesus in Mark 10:17-22 (inner texture): the Pentecost event in Acts 2 (intertexture): the woman who anointed Jesus in Luke 7:36-50 and John 9 (social and cultural texture): the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8:26-40 and &#x201c;women keep silent&#x201d; in 1 Corinthians 14: 26-40 (ideological texture).Vernon K.

The story of how this came to be is told from the point of view of a young girl who grew up there.<br><br>Ann Grifalconi's bold, dynamic art and rhythmic storytelling recreate this world and make The Village of Round and Square Houses a perfect book for reading aloud. <br></p><p>Grade 2-4 The telling of this beautifully coordinated African folk tale is shared by a little girl and her grandmother who live in the village of Tos in West Central Africa. This village in Cameroons is located at the foot of Naka Mountain, which is believed by the grandmother to be partially responsible for the "natural order of things" which specifies that the men of the village reside in the square houses and the women in the round houses. The first half of the book describes the events of a typical day among the members of the young girl's family: work in the fields; the supper preparation; eating the meal; the post-mealtime relaxation. When Gran'ma Tika finishes smoking her pipe, she becomes the storyteller for the second half of the book as she tells her granddaughter about the time Naka Mountain erupted. The villagers were miraculously spared, but the village was destroyed except for two housesone square and one round. The village chief, unable to distinguish his ash-covered subjects, assigned the "tall gray things" (men) to live in the square house, and the "round gray things" (women) to live in the round house. Sensitive chalk drawings emit expressions of dignity, strength, love and warmth among the characters. Appropriate and complementary earth tones predominate. The skills which Grifalconi exhibited in her City Rhythms (Bobbs-Merrill, 1965; o.p.) are perfected in this exquisitely beautiful and appealing book. Helen E. Williams, University of Maryland, College Park<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Tos is an actual village, on the side of an inactive volcano in Central Africa. It is the village in the book's title, where women dwell in round thatch-roofed huts and men live in square ones. This book tells the story of how the houses were so designated, in the aftermath of the volcano releasing its full fury on the village. Grifalconi effortlessly embroiders the customs of the village into her melodious narration. The author, who has illustrated over 50 children's books, including Lucille Clifton's Everett Anderson books, here illustrates her own tale, told to her by a young girl who grew up in Tos. The resting purple volcano, suddenly erupting into orange; the eerie orange sun; the villagers covered with ash; the purple and orange skies; the dense, lush junglesall are captured beautifully by Grifalconi's art. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Devoted: A Novel (The Bishop&#39;s Family)</h2><p><b>Fan Favorite Suzanne Woods Fisher Offers Readers Tender Romance, Humor, and Plenty of Surprises<br><br></b>Bright, curious, and restless, Ruthie Stoltzfus loves her family but is stuck in a sea of indecision about her future: Should she stay Amish?

He starts by recognizing vast differences between equine and human brains and mental processes. He describes the traditional trainerï¿½s mistake of judging horses according to the standards of docile or good horse and bad-tempered or mean horse. The horseï¿½s brain cannot make abstract judgments about ï¿½goodï¿½ or ï¿½badï¿½ behavior, but readily responds to conditioning by trainers who understand the equine brain, the instincts that drive it, and a horseï¿½s way of knowing the world. The author emphasizes that by training a horse according to a set of consistent responses that coincide with equine instincts, horse owners can avoid undesirable horse behavior. He offers a training program and amplifies on it with enlightening case studies. Here is must-reading for every current and prospective horse owner and rider.

This peerless quarterback&nbsp;guided the Green Bay Packers to two Super Bowls and one championship win, shattering countless NFL records along the way.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Gunslinger</i> tells Brett Favre&#x2019;s story for the first time, drawing on more than five hundred interviews, including many from the people closest to Favre. Jeff Pearlman charts an unparalleled journey from his rough rural childhood and lackluster high school football career to landing the last scholarship at Southern Mississippi to a car accident that nearly took his life.&nbsp;Favre clawed back, getting drafted into the NFL by the Atlanta Falcons, then finding his way to Green Bay, where he restored the Packers to greatness and inspired a fan base as passionate as any in the game. Yet he struggled with demons: addiction, infidelity, the loss of his father, and a fraught, painfully prolonged exit from the game he loved, a game he couldn&#x2019;t bear to leave.<br> &nbsp;<br> Grand, gritty, and revelatory, <i>Gunslinger</i> is a big sports biography of the highest order, a fascinating portrait of the man with the rocket arm whose life has been one of triumph, of fame, of tragedy, of embarrassment, and&#x2014;ultimately&#x2014;of redemption.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>JEFF PEARLMAN is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of eight books, including <i>Football for a Buck,</i><i>The Bad Guys Won!</i>, <i>Boys Will Be Boys</i>, <i>Showtime</i>, <i>Sweetness </i>and <i>Gunslinger</i>. He lives in Southern California with his wife Catherine and children, Casey and Emmett. He is the host of the <i>Two Writers Slinging Yang</i> podcast and blogs regularly at jeffpearlman.com.&#x201c;Jeff Pearlman writing about Brett Favre is a perfect match of author and subject, making <i>Gunslinger</i> as rollicking and raucous and joyous&nbsp;as Favre was improvising at Lambeau Field.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2013;David Maraniss, author of <i>When Pride Still Mattered </i>and <i>Once in a Great City</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Over&nbsp;two decades, Brett Favre was as compelling a figure as any in the National Football League. He alone was 'Must-See TV.' In <i>Gunslinger</i>, Jeff Pearlman provides an extraordinary look at every facet of the life of a man who performed on sport's grandest stage and who had one helluva time along the way.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2013;Al Michaels</b><br> &nbsp;<br> "Jeff Pearlman's deeply reported book is an unprecedented picture of an unprecedented athlete. Brett Favre emerges as at once incorrigibly childish and a magnetic leader of men. Perhaps never in sports history has a star so big inhabited a market so small. <i>Gunslinger </i>leaves an impression of Favre that&nbsp;is neither simply good nor bad, but rather something nearly non-existent in sportswriting today: a full portrait of a human being."<br><b>&#x2013;David Epstein, author of <i>The Sports Gene</i></b><br><br> "Here's a story as iconic as 'The Gunslinger' himself, Brett Favre. Like Favre, Jeff Pearlman goes deep&#x2013;and scores."<br><b>&#x2013;Adam Schefter, author of <i>Romo: My Life on the Edge</i> and <i>Think Like A Champion</i></b><br><br> "This is the deepest understanding we are likely to have of Favre for quite some time...&nbsp;Pearlman's book is a complete, satisfying biography of a gunslinger who, for both better and worse, was far more complex than most fans have understood." --<b><i>Kirkus Reviews&nbsp;</i></b><br><br> "Presenting Favre as a congenial, larger-than-life character, a 'gunslinger,'&nbsp;who was fun to watch on the field and hard to root against, Pearlman proves to be a good match for his subject and creates a compelling work." -- <i><b>Library Journal</b></i>, <b>starred review</b><br><br> "A&nbsp;wealth of NFL-insider anecdotes sure to enthrall fans. Rarely does a straightforward sports bio ascend mainstream best-seller lists, but this could be the exception. Clear a spot: <i>Gunslinger </i>is coming."<b> -- <i>Booklist</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Skilled sports biographer Pearlman brings his dogged, one-more-phone-call approach to this massively enjoyable book on Brett Favre, the gambling, cannon-armed quarterback whose talent and boyish enthusiasm brought the Green Bay Packers back to hallowed relevance in the mid-1990s.&#x201d;<br><b>--&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><p>"What does 'Gunslinger' offer the Wisconsinite who has read a gazillion words about Favre over the past decades? A perspective outside the Packerland bubble, for one. He also delivers detailed reporting on aspects of Favre's life that we tend to dismiss in a line of background . . .

He moved to the firm of Heinemann in 1913, where he spent the rest of his working life, becoming Chairman and Managing Director in 1932. He wrote this version of <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> as a companion volume to <i>Cinderella</i>, also illustrated by Arthur Rackham. The story first appeared in English in 1729, when Robert Samber translated Charles Perrault's fairy tale <i>La Belle au bois dormant</i>. C.S. Evans has expanded Perrault's story but followed the later version recorded by the Brothers Grimm in giving his heroine the name of Briar-Rose and ending with her awakening and betrothal, omitting the wicked mother-in-law who orders her grandchildren to be cooked for supper. Instead he lengthens the story by such inventive details as the menu for the christening feast, the books of magic consulted for an antidote to the thirteenth fairy's malice, and the many accomplishments of Princess Briar-Rose.</p></p><h2>Margery Kempe (High Risk Books)</h2><p>Based on fragments from the Christian mystic&#39;s autobiography written in the 1430s and the author&#39;s tale of unrequited gay love, offers a story of Margery&#39;s sexual obsession with visits from Jesus</p><p>Robert Gluck is the author of Elements of a Coffee Service and Denny Smith, as well as the novels Jack the Modernist and Margery Kempe for Serpent&#39;s Tail. He also writes poetry, art criticism and teaches creative writing at San Francisco State University.Gl ck pushes the envelope way too far as he attempts to use the history of a failed, would-be saint from the 15th century to explore his own romantic obsession in the 1990s. Gl ck (Jack the Modernist, not reviewed) admittedly embellishes the autobiography that Margery Kempe wrote during the 1430s to reveal the unhealthy psychology of this Jesus-crazed heretic. Margery is an upstanding woman, daughter of the mayor, wife of John, and mother of 14 children, who loses it when devils begin taunting her. But later, as she lies in the bed to which John has tied her because he's tired of her insane roaring, Jesus pays a visit, loosens her ropes, and inspires a passion that makes Margery swoon just looking at ``the semi-circles of his ass'' and the ``splayed tips of his long toes.'' Margery pretends to go on with her life, but all the while she's really waiting for Jesus in a heightened state of arousal. When he does show up ten years later, it's obvious there's going to be a whole lot of bumping and grinding going on. Unfortunately for Margery, Jesus is distant and cold (he absentmindedly counts his muscle twitchings during sex: `` `I spasmed eleven times,' he mused''), but this only makes Margery want him more. Classic victim mentality? Maybe. But Gl ck likes to think of it as Margery's modus operandi--she wants power, money, sex, prestige, and fame--and she needs Jesus to make the necessary connections to priests, vicars...even to God. If this isn't enough, the author sprinkles in his own unrequited-love story with a pretty little rich boy who refuses to make a commitment. Of course, Gl ck only gathers the strength to present his lover with a live-with-me-or-leave-me ultimatum when he sees how far Margery falls in her desire for the unattainable. Numbingly frenzied, frustrated, and futile. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The driver&#x2019;s ID tag showed a dark mustached face with glowering black eyes and indicated he was Mustafah Salaam.<br>She&#x2019;d often heard "the Bruckner" mentioned in the incessant traffic reports on New York City radio but had no idea where it was.<br>"This is Bronx," the driver added, anticipating her next question.<br>Kate felt a quick stab of fear. The Bronx? Visions of burned-out buildings and rubble-strewn lots swirled through her brain.<br>Oh, Jeanette, she thought, staring ahead at the cab they were following, where are you going? Where are you taking me?<br>Kate had stashed her two teenagers with her ex and taken a short leave from her pediatric group practice in Trenton to stay with Jeanette during her recovery from brain tumor therapy. The experimental treatment had been a resounding success. No ill effects...at least none that would be apparent to Jeanette&#x2019;s treating physician.<br>But since completion of the treatment, Kate had noticed a definite personality change. The Jeanette Vega she&#x2019;d come to know and deeply love over these past two years was a warm, giving person, full of enthusiasm for life, with an opinion about everything. A delightfully edgy chatterbox. But slowly she had changed. The new Jeanette was cold and distant, rarely speaking unless spoken to, leaving her apartment without a word about where she was going, disappearing for hours at a time.<br>At first Kate had chalked it up to an acute reactive depression. Why not? What medical diagnosis can rock the foundations of your world more deeply than an inoperable malignant brain tumor? But depression didn&#x2019;t quite explain her behavior. When Jeanette should have been depressed&#x2014;when she&#x2019;d been told she had a literal death sentence growing in her brain&#x2014;she&#x2019;d remained her upbeat self. Now, after a miraculous cure, after regaining her whole future, she&#x2019;d become another person.<br>Maybe it was a stress reaction.<br>Or a side effect of the treatment. As a physician Kate prided herself on keeping current with medical progress, so she was familiar with medicine&#x2019;s cutting edge; but the experimental protocol that had saved Jeanette seemed damn near science fiction.<br>Yet it had worked. The tumor was dead, and Jeanette would live on.<br>But would she live on without Kate?<br>That, Kate admitted, was what was really disturbing her. Nearing middle age&#x2014;in darn good shape for forty-four, she knew, but still six years older than Jeanette&#x2014;she couldn&#x2019;t help worrying that Jeanette had found someone else. Someone younger.<br>That would be so unlike the old Jeanette. But this new Jeanette...who could say?<br>Jeanette had been put on notice that her remaining time on earth was numbered in months instead of decades; she&#x2019;d believed she&#x2019;d seen her last Christmas tree, tasted her last Thanksgiving dinner. And then it was all given back to her. How could anyone&#x2019;s psyche survive that sort of trauma unscathed?<br>Perhaps the ordeal had caused Jeanette tos reassess her life. Maybe she&#x2019;d looked around and asked, <em>Is this what I want</em>? And perhaps, in some new back-from-the-brink perspective, she&#x2019;d decided she wanted something else. More. Different.<br>At least she could tell me, Kate thought. She owes me that much.<br>Jeanette hadn&#x2019;t asked her to leave&#x2014;she had the right since it was her apartment&#x2014;but she had moved out of the bedroom they&#x2019;d always shared on Kate&#x2019;s visits and into the study where she slept on the couch. No amount of questioning from Kate had elicited a reason why.<br>The not knowing gnawed at her. So tonight, when Jeanette had walked out the door without a word, Kate had followed.<br>Never in a million years would she have imagined herself trailing the woman she loved through the night. But things change. It hadn&#x2019;t been all that long ago that she never would have imagined herself loving another woman.<br>Up ahead, Jeanette&#x2019;s cab turned off the Bruckner and Kate&#x2019;s followed it onto a road the signs identified as the Bronx River Parkway. And after a few miles the city suddenly disappeared and they were in the woods&#x2014;in the Bronx?<br>"Stay closer," she told the driver. "You&#x2019;re letting them get too far ahead."<br>She didn&#x2019;t want to come all this way just to lose her.<br>Then Kate saw signs for the Bronx Zoo and New York Botanical Gardens. More turns, each new road smaller than the last until they were traveling a tree-lined residential street.<br>"Are we still in the Bronx?" she asked, marveling at all the well-kept homes trailing by on either side.<br>"Still Bronx, yes," the driver told her.<br>How come it never looks like this on TV? she wondered.<br>"Keep going," Kate said when she saw Jeanette&#x2019;s cab pull into the curb before a neat brick colonial.<br>Her anxiety soared as a thousand questions cascaded through her mind. Who lived there? Another woman?<br>She had the driver stop half a block beyond. She watched Jeanette&#x2019;s cab leave her on the sidewalk and pull away. As Jeanette started up the walk toward the house, Kate opened her own cab&#x2019;s door.<br>"Wait here," she said.<br>"No-no," the driver said. "You must pay."<br>Nice neighborhood or not, this was still the Bronx, and a long way from Jeanette&#x2019;s apartment. Kate did not want to be stranded here. She glanced at the meter and fished the exact amount out of her wallet.<br>"Here," she said, keeping her voice low as she handed him the money. "You&#x2019;ll get your tip when we get back to the city."<br>He seemed to accept that, nodding without comment as he took the money.<br>She pulled her raincoat tightly around her. A chilly night for June. The fog was thinning and the wet street glistened in the glow from the streetlights; every sound seemed amplified. Kate was glad she&#x2019;d worn sneakers as she padded along the street, keeping the parked cars between her and Jeanette.<br>When she&#x2019;d approached as close as she dared, she stopped behind a tree trunk and watched Jeanette walk up the front steps of the house. Kate&#x2019;s heart ached at the sight of her: a yellow rain slicker and loose jeans hid her feminine curves; a Yankees cap hid much of her straight, jet black hair, but Kate knew those curves, remembered the strawberry scent of the shampoo Jeanette used to wash that hair.<br>Suddenly Kate wished she hadn&#x2019;t come. Who was going to open that door? Forty minutes ago she&#x2019;d been dying to know, now she was terrified. But she couldn&#x2019;t turn away. Especially not now, because the door was opening and a man stood there, a heavyset fiftyish man with a round face and small eyes and a balding melon head. He smiled and opened his arms and Jeanette embraced him.<br>Kate&#x2019;s stomach lurched.<br>A man? Not Jeanette! Anyone but Jeanette!

Mysteries were Elspeth's favorite kind of book when she was a kid herself, and they still are. She says it's fun to try to figure things out.

Cousins Titus, Timothy, and Sarah-Jane make up the Three Cousins Detective Club. In this seventh series title about their adventures, they go on an excursion with Sarah-Jane's father to look at a lighthouse that a friend of his would like to buy and restore. The lighthouse shows signs of vandalism, and immediately the three kids take up their detective roles and start scouting for clues. Sarah-Jane exclaims, rather flippantly, that at least the lighthouse isn't haunted, but unknown to her, her comment is overheard. Later the kids are indeed "haunted" at the lighthouse by none other than the eavesdropper, a boy who had been a close friend of the lighthouse's late owner. Because it is a special place for the boy, he is using every possible tactic to deter prospective buyers. The story is told in lively, natural dialogue, and the author's enthusiasm for lighthouses and their lore makes it delightful reading. <i>Shelley Townsend-Hudson</i></p><h2>AN Outline of European Architecture</h2><p>Pevsner, Nikolaus, Outline of European Architecture, An</p><p>'A definitive and personal overview of the buildings that make European cities the glories they are, written by one of the great critics of the century.' Sir John Tusa The Guardian. <br> <br> For over sixty years Sir Nikolaus Pevsner's study of European architecture has been regarded as a seminal work which has inspired countless students of architecture. In this updated large format edition with elegant and accessible design, an extra dimension is provided through the integration of over 200 superb colour photographs and new plans. Pevsner's claim that 'the good architect requires the sculptor's and the painter's modes of vision' is fully substantiated in this glorious volume. <br> <br> Pevsner believed that the history of architecture was primarily a history of man shaping space. With this as his starting point, he reviewed the most beautiful and dramatic structures that represent the styles and cultures of Europe from the fourth century onwards. His grand tour of Romanesque basilicas, Gothic cathedrals, Renaissance villas and Baroque churches, eloquently defines 'the changing spirits of the changing ages'. In later chapters he considers the revival of medieval forms in the age of Romanticism and the Arts and Crafts Movement through to the radical and unsparing geometry of twentieth-century Modernism. His survey concluded in the post-war years and the start of the redefinition of many devastated cityscapes and in a new preface and an illuminating postscript the architect and academic Michael Forsyth brings the review right up to the present day. In a consideration of recent buildings in Europe by modern masters such as James Stirling, Norman Foster and Frank Gehry, he identifies a natural evolution of architectural achievement. <br> <br> Through such a perceptive understanding of the heritage of past civilisations, and in the delineation of the buildings that continue to be recognized as the greatest symbols of artistic endeavour, Pevsner continues to be as stimulating and relevant as ever. <br> <br> Pevsner believed that the history of architecture was primarily a history of man shaping space.

A sandwich-shaped, foldout book, <i>Sam?s Sandwich</i> invites young readers to peel back the lettuce, tomato, and other ingredients to discover Sam?s rhyming, crawling surprises.<br><br></p></p><p>David Pelham lives in England.Once they feast their eyes on the exterior of this mouth-watering volume, youngsters will be impatient to dig in. The front and back covers are designed--quite convincingly--to resemble pieces of bread, and the spine reveals the neatly layered ingredients of the special snack Sam prepares for his sister. The most delectable morsels, however, are found within--each spread depicts one of the foods the obliging brother adds to his culinary creation. But the realistic renditions of sliced tomato, cucumber, cheese, pastrami, onion and hard-boiled egg fold out to disclose some of Sam's secret--and less appetizing--additions, including a fly, worm, slug, caterpillar and some ants. Youngsters will be too engrossed in Sam's creative sandwich-making to notice that Pelham's singsong rhyme occasionally falters. This cleverly designed book accomplishes what it sets out to do: it serves up a tasty little snack rather than a full-course meal.

In our multiethnic world, questions of individual identity are becoming increasingly unclear. Now in ABRAHAM'S CHILDREN bestselling author Jon Entine vividly brings to life the profound human implications of the Age of Genetics while illuminating one of today's most controversial topics: the connection between genetics and who we are, and specifically the question "Who is a Jew?"<br><br>Entine weaves a fascinating narrative, using breakthroughs in genetic genealogy to reconstruct the Jewish biblical tradition of the chosen people and the hereditary Israelite priestly caste of Cohanim. Synagogues in the mountains of India and China and Catholic churches with a Jewish identity in New Mexico and Colorado provide different patterns of connection within the tangled history of the Jewish diaspora. Legendary accounts of the Hebrew lineage of Ethiopian tribesmen, the building of Africa's Great Zimbabwe fortress, and even the so-called Lost Tribes are reexamined in light of advanced DNA technology. Entine also reveals the shared ancestry of Israelites and Christians. <br><br>As people from across the world discover their Israelite roots, their riveting stories unveil exciting new approaches to defining one's identity. Not least, Entine addresses possible connections between DNA and Jewish intelligence and the controversial notion that Jews are a "race apart." ABRAHAM'S CHILDREN is a compelling reinterpretation of biblical history and a challenging and exciting illustration of the promise and power of genetic research.</p><p>Jon Entine, author of the bestseller <em>TABOO: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk about It</em>, is an international columnist, adjunct fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and consultant on business and media ethics. He spent twenty years as a producer and executive with NBC News and ABC News and has taught at numerous universities, including Miami University (Ohio) and New York University. He has been awarded many fellowships and prizes for his journalism, including a National Press Club award and two Emmys.Entine (Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It, 2000) tackles the thorny matter of Jewish identity. Some of his conclusions may be surprising. <p>The author, a secular Jew and an adjunct fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, has been driven by family health crises to seek out the genetics of Judaism. In doing so, he unravels an epic tale of "The Chosen People." DNA acts as a starting point for discussion of Jewish origins--Chapter 1 is entitled, "The Dead Sea Scrolls of DNA"--as Entine explains how it is now possible through genetic testing for apparent non-Jews to discover Jewish ancestry, and for Jews (and others) to learn more about their origins. The author disputes conventional wisdom, which cautious scientists have advanced recently, that genetic differences between individuals are minute and superficial. Instead, he embraces genetics as a method of discovering more about the diverse breadth of humanity. Nevertheless, Entine realizes that Jewish DNA does not necessarily make a Jew. To explore the question of Jewish origins, Entine takes the reader on a global tour, exploring both mythic and factual migrations of Jews across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and finally into the Americas. DNA testing has allowed scientists to explore the validity of direct ancestry claims for far-flung Jewish communities in such places as South Africa and India, while it has also identified hidden enclaves of "crypto-Jews" in places such as the American Southwest. Entine goes on to discuss the touchy subject of race, and how Jewish identity has been perceived by both Jews and non-Jews through recent history and into the present. He also bluntly approaches modern (and historic) stereotypes of Jews and offers possible reasons for their formation, as well as their potential validity in certain cases. Because the author's approach is broad and inclusive, the book is sure to cause controversy, but it serves as an excellent catalyst for discussion as many continue to ask the question, "What does it mean to be Jewish?" </p><p>Engaging and informative reading for Jews and non-Jews alike. -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>This book informs us of who were are, how we got here, and, why we do what we do. New methods of genetic study turn up fascinating connections and differences between the Ashkenazim and Sephardim, not only in language and customs, but also in DNA. For example, studies of women's diseases show that one group has a higher incidence of breast cancer, and the other, a higher incidence of cervical cancer. Maps detail migration routes, and chapters discuss the history and rituals of various tribes and families. The book is full of information and it is a fascinating popular read. Highly recommended. -- <i>Association of Jewish Libraries Newsletter, September/October.

If going to the movies has been the twentieth century's most popular source of artistic pleasure, reading about the movies may not be far behind.</strong></p> For this delicious, instructive, and vastly enjoyable anthology, Roger Ebert has selected and introduced an international treasury of more than 100 selections that touch on every aspect of filmmaking and filmgoing. Here are the stars (Truman Capote on Marilyn Monroe, Joan Didion on John Wayne, Tom Wolfe on Cary Grant, Lauren Bacall on herself), the directors (John Houseman on Orson Welles, Kenneth Tynan on Mel Brooks, John Huston on himself), the makers and shakers (producer Julia Phillips, mogul Daryll F. Zanuck, stuntman Joe Bonomo), and the critics and theorists (Pauline Kael, Graham Greene, Andrew Sarris, Susan Sontag). Here as well are the novelists who have indelibly captured the experience of moviegoing in our lives (Walker Percy, James Agee, Larry McMurtry) and the culture of the movie business (F. Scott Fitzgerald, Budd Schulberg, Nathanael West). Here is a book to get lost in and return to time and time againat once a history, an anatomy, and a loving appreciation of the central art form of our time.</p><p>This is the best film book of the mid-'90s and probably the best anthology of writing about the movies ever published. Choosing from the work of novelists and essayists as well as directors, actors, screenwriters and technicians, Ebert places the best that has ever been said or thought about the movies on parade. Here Graham Greene, Delmore Schwartz, and Susan Sontag sit down with Akira Kurosawa, Janet Leigh, and Budd Schulberg; Robert Stone, Julia Phillips, and Kenneth Anger shake hands with Louise Brooks, Gore Vidal, and John Updike. Beautifully organized with lively commentary by the editor, <b>Roger Ebert's Book of Film</b> is entertaining enough to inspire the casual peruser to do further reading and serious enough to be a staple of any good film library.TV film maven and Chicago Tribune columnist Ebert (A Kiss Is Still a Kiss, 1984) gathers 100 pieces in belated tribute to the first century of the movies. In attempting to create an anthology of outstanding film writing that would reflect film's multifaceted nature--at once art and aphrodisiac, entertainment and commerce, myth and industrial product--Ebert has stumbled a bit; the book suffers from a jury-rigged structure that mainly illuminates the arbitrariness of Ebert's choices. The pieces he has assembled are wildly uneven, although many do shine. The overwhelming majority of the collection consists of excerpts from longer works, some of which don't entirely make sense out of context. For example, the passages from Larry McMurtry's novel The Last Picture Show, while evocative, seem unduly skeletal when stripped from the heart of the novel. Moreover, although Ebert's attempt to represent the widest possible range of writing about film is admirable, with almost no writer represented by more than one piece, does anyone believe that a piece from a Web site devoted to Quentin Tarantino, an excerpt from Janet Leigh's pedestrian little book on the making of Psycho, snatches of Mario Puzo's The Godfather, and Charles Bukowski's musings on film represent the best writing available on the medium? Too many of the directors' entries are self-aggrandizing, the mix of fiction and nonfiction is awkward, and sudden shifts, such as the one from a chronological grouping on silent films to a handful of essays on genre, are unhelpful. On the other hand, Ebert has drawn from some unjustly forgotten books, such as Jonathan Rosenbaum's elegiac and rigorous Moving Places, and Christopher Isherwood's delicate and charming Prater Violet. An entertaining hodgepodge, but a hodgepodge all the same. (Book-of-the-Month Club selection; author tour) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Within these pages I&#x2019;ve included my tricks, gimmicks, aces up my sleeves, and sales secrets, but I feel it&#x2019;s important to underline something before you get started. Success takes hard work, research, knowledge, and commitment, but the real victory comes through honesty, transparency, and being true to your word. That&#x2019;s what makes a <i>truly</i> successful person.</p><p>The subtitle of this book is <i>The Secrets of Selling Anything to Anyone</i>, but I want to point out that some things in life are not for sale: your loved ones, your children, your pets, your values, your integrity, your beliefs, your spirituality. It&#x2019;s not only that they are priceless. They are <i>sacred</i>. As a super salesman, it&#x2019;s important to remind myself that not even I can sell certain things, especially my soul. Everything else is negotiable.</p><p>&#x2014;Fredrik</p><p></p><p></p><p>FOREWORD</p><p>The first time I met Fredrik Eklund was poolside atop the SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills. I was in Hollywood shooting an episode of ABC&#x2019;s <i>Shark Tank</i>, and Fredrik was on the roof attracting attention. I can spot a great salesperson from across the street and certainly from across the pool. Fredrik has magnetism that&#x2019;s impossible to miss. At the time, I didn&#x2019;t know who he was (it was before <i>Million Dollar Listing</i> <i>New York</i>), but I did know one thing: He was a success. Fredrik Eklund has that killer instinct.</p><p>When I started my NYC real estate firm in 1973 with a $1,000 loan from a boyfriend, I had no experience in sales and no doubt that I&#x2019;d be successful. Back then there weren&#x2019;t any female-owned real estate firms in the city. It was a business worked by women and <i>owned</i> by men. I wasn&#x2019;t welcome, but I certainly got noticed. From wearing my short skirts and bright colors to calling my sales team the &#x201c;Power Brokers,&#x201d; I created my reality&#x2014;that I was <i>the best seller in the city</i>. And what happened? In 1999, the Corcoran Group became the number one residential real estate company in New York City.</p><p>Fredrik, a Swede with no contacts and no real estate license, came to America, and, in less than a dozen years, leads the number one real estate sales team in the nation. Now that&#x2019;s the American dream. How&#x2019;d he do it? He knew that perception creates reality, and he had the courage to spot and seize opportunity.</p><p>The number one trait I always looked for when I was hiring someone for my company and what I look for now when I&#x2019;m investing in entrepreneurs on <i>Shark Tank</i> is passion, a <i>need</i> to succeed. Someone who&#x2019;d rather die than not be the best. That&#x2019;s Fredrik, and after reading this book, that will be you, too.</p><p>Like any great salesperson, Fredrik is very persuasive. For example, bragging about him in this foreword wasn&#x2019;t enough. He even talked me into giving you my five personal beliefs about becoming a success, all of which are included in his secrets to selling anything:</p><p><b>1. People want to do business with someone they like. </b>Don&#x2019;t ever be fooled into thinking that a job is only about the product. It&#x2019;s not. Business is all about the people. If people like you, they&#x2019;re going to want to work with you. And if they don&#x2019;t, you&#x2019;re going to have an almost insurmountable obstacle to overcome. Your job is to make them like you.</p><p><b>2. Selling is nothing more than playing up the good and playing down the bad.</b> If knowing how to do this comes naturally to you, you&#x2019;ve got a head start. If you don&#x2019;t, you can learn. When I worked in a diner, I was up against another waitress to attract customers. All the men wanted to sit with her because she had big breasts. And, well, I <i>don&#x2019;t</i>. It was my mom who gave me my best sales (and life) advice. She told me to forget about what I didn&#x2019;t have, and use what I did have&#x2014;a nice personality, a great smile, and the gift of gab&#x2014;to get customers to want to sit in my section. I packed them in! Maximize the positive; minimize the negative.</p><p><b>3. Every successful person knows how to fail well. </b>Successful people get knocked down like everyone else, but they take less time getting back up and back out there. Did you know the lowest rate of suicide is among commission salespeople? Why? Because they deal with so many rejections on a daily basis, they are more adept at handling life&#x2019;s hard knocks.</p><p><b>4. Everybody wants what everybody wants. </b>This is the basic psychology of sales. Your task is to figure out how to make people think that what you&#x2019;ve got to offer is the best thing since hot dogs and baseball. Two things to remember: More than one buyer creates urgency, and when people are told they can&#x2019;t have something, they want it all the more.</p><p><b>5. The most successful people believe their success is only temporary. </b>Top producers end each year convinced they&#x2019;ll never have another year as good. Their own track record becomes their biggest competition. In great successes, fear breeds accomplishment.</p><p>For twenty-five years I managed New York&#x2019;s top sellers, and I know how hard successful people work to keep their trade secrets. So, why would you give it all away when you&#x2019;re number one? Why would you create thousands of new successful high-kickers? Let it be known: I think Fredrik is nuts for sharing his secrets, but I suppose a real success isn&#x2019;t afraid of competition. He thrives on it.</p><p>I leave you in good hands&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and on the road to making millions.</p><p>&#x2014;Barbara Corcoran</p><p>Bestselling author of <i>Shark Tales: How I Turned $1,000 into a Billion Dollar Business</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>Make &#x2019;Em Want What You&#x2019;ve Got</p><p>I became a salesman when I was seven years old. I was living in Stockholm, where I was born, and I signed up with a company I heard about through school to sell Christmas calendars and books. Those who sold the most each week would win a waterproof, yellow Sony Walkman. (Remember those?) I decided I didn&#x2019;t just want to sell a lot; I wanted to be the number one seller among the thousands of kids selling Christmas calendars in Sweden. I was going to sell more than <i>anyone</i>!</p><p>My goal made me obsessed. I went to bed every night, and, like a prisoner counting the days on his jail-cell wall, I charted on the wallpaper of my room a matrix-like plan to world-calendar-sales domination. When my dad came across my scribbles, he was <i>arg</i>! (That&#x2019;s Swedish for <i>angry</i>!) But it was too late! The writing was literally on the wall: I was on my way to becoming the biggest seller.</p><p>Every morning, I put on my favorite sweater my grandmother had hand-knitted for me, with two reindeers on the front, loaded all the catalogs on a sled, and went knocking door-to-door, schlepping my wares through the snow into Akalla, a suburb north of Stockholm. I knew the market because it was my neighborhood. A million homes were built there during the 1970s, and many retired people had moved in. The old ladies were my favorite targets, a captive audience for a friendly kid with a selling smile. I&#x2019;d knock on their doors and take a step back so that when they answered, I&#x2019;d be perfectly positioned to look up at them so they could notice my cute sweater. I&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Hi. It&#x2019;s me, Fredrik. It&#x2019;s nice to see you again.&#x201d; Almost always, they&#x2019;d invite me in. I became the grandson who was finally visiting. I sat with them and talked, talked, talked and sold, sold, sold. I made them <i>want </i>to buy a calendar from me.</p><p>The result? I drank a lot of green tea that winter, listened to more than my fair share of World War II stories, and broke all records for the calendar company. And I really mean <i>all</i> records. I even got a letter from the president of the company asking what my secret was. (But I kept the secrets for this book and am sending him a signed copy as my answer, exactly thirty years later!) I also won so many Walkmans that I sold them, too&#x2014;to my classmates at school!</p><p>Today I use the same technique I used on the Swedish grannies when I&#x2019;m showing million-dollar properties to Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Timberlake, Daniel Craig, or a family from the Upper West Side, and convincing them the time to buy is <i>now</i>&#x2014;from <i>me</i>.</p><p>But you don&#x2019;t have to work on commission to benefit from my selling strategies. Because let me tell you something: You&#x2019;ve been in sales your whole life, even if you haven&#x2019;t realized it. Have you been on a date where you dressed your best and turned on the charm? You were selling. Have you asked someone to take out the trash because you were tired and didn&#x2019;t want to? You were selling. Have you interviewed for a job? You were selling. That&#x2019;s why <i>The Sell </i>is for everyone. It describes all of the sales each of us make every day, even if our job title isn&#x2019;t &#x201c;salesperson.&#x201d; Regardless of the industry you&#x2019;re in&#x2014;Christmas calendars, Internet, real estate, baking, motherhood&#x2014;understand this right here, right now: It&#x2019;s <i>all the same</i>. <i>If you know how to sell</i> you<i>, you know how to sell anything</i>. Whether you&#x2019;re selling medical equipment to a doctor or an early bedtime to your third grader, The Sell is a daily event in everyone&#x2019;s life.</p><p>What do sellers do? They persuade, influence, and convince someone to give them something in exchange for what they&#x2019;ve got. How is that different from trying to convince your boss to support your idea? Or trying to talk your husband into going on a vacation to Tahiti when he&#x2019;d rather go to Tokyo? Anytime we want someone to do something, we are putting The Sell into action. We sell a smile to get the better table in a restaurant, a kind remark to get our way with customer service, and sincerity to form long-lasting friendships. That is selling. Whether it is a car buyer&#x2019;s money, a coworker&#x2019;s help, your teenager&#x2019;s attention, or a best friend&#x2019;s guidance, realizing how to motivate someone into taking action is The Sell.</p><p>Are people buying what you&#x2019;re selling?</p><p>Are they buying <i>you</i>?</p><p>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½</p><p>A decade ago, I moved to New York City from Sweden with a pair of sneakers and a dream: to make it to the top in the city that never sleeps. I didn&#x2019;t have a clue then as to how I&#x2019;d actually make that happen or even what my career path would be, but I absolutely believed I would be the best. I believed in the only product I had: <i>me</i>. In my fairy tale, I knew that one day, regardless of the industry I chose, I&#x2019;d be the king of New York. I visualized headlines, glamour, and a wallet stuffed with hundred-dollar bills. I knew it wasn&#x2019;t going to be easy in the most cutthroat city in the world, but I was ready for the battle.</p><p>My story began in the suburbs of Stockholm, Sweden. That&#x2019;s Sv<i>eeee</i>den, wedged between Norway and Finland in Northern Europe and far away from big and glitzy Manhattan. Yes, it&#x2019;s very cold and dark in the winters, and, no, it is not Switzerland. (I&#x2019;ve discovered a lot of Americans confuse the two.) And there are no ice bears (I&#x2019;m told you call them polar bears) roaming around the streets, just a bunch of tall, blond people with blue eyes who love vodka, dancing the frog dance on Midsummer&#x2019;s Eve (intoxicated by the former), building safe cars, designing low-cost furniture that you put together yourself, rolling out stores with inexpensive clothes all over the world, and writing catchy pop music you love to hate (or hate to love).</p><p>We didn&#x2019;t have a lot of money when I was young, but my parents always made sure we got to travel. When I was ten years old, my father, Klas Eklund, a Swedish economist, unknowingly changed the course of my life. He had been invited to give a speech in New York City and exchanged the first-class ticket he had received for three economy tickets and brought my older brother, Sigge, and me with him.</p><p>Even as I am writing this, I still remember the yellow cab picking us up outside JFK Airport, the reggae music on the radio, the almost tropical heat as I rolled the window down in the backseat and dropped my head outside to see the approaching skyline.</p><p>I am sitting there again now, ten years old, and you are sitting next to me. Are you with me?</p><p>Feel the hot vinyl seat; roll down the window; smell that humid, sweet, and hopeful autumn air of 1987 New York. We are on this journey together, you and me.</p><p>The city&#x2019;s energy, excitement, and vertical living instantly hooked me. There was also a dark side to Gotham that I loved. I could smell the danger. At dusk, the cab took us through Times Square with its neon fireworks, and my jaw dropped. I could see the poor, the rich, and the gaps in between. The thousands of tourists with cameras signaled that <i>this</i> was the center of the universe. I believe there are certain impressions in life that are so strong they are etched into the neurons of your brain forever and actually change that chemical soup permanently. This was one of those moments. The second was my first commission check. The third was falling in love, and I hope seeing the face of my newborn daughter will someday be one, too.</p><p>My father, Sigge, and I climbed to the top of the Statue of Liberty, and I got to see her perspective of the glimmering city across the water, a beehive of excitement. There is a photo of me up in her crown, looking out, and you can see in my eyes how awestruck I was. I had the vision of my liberation. I decided right then and there that I would become one with the city. I would become very successful, but more important, someone who was following his dreams.</p><p>I often think that until this moment, our family had been my little solar system. My brother and I were the planets orbiting the sun, our family home back in Stockholm. But suddenly the laws of gravitation were bent, perhaps because I saw another sun through the windows of the Statue of Liberty: New York. This sun symbolized a new goal: freedom, success, and the ultimate sell.</p><p>As we ferried back to shore, the rain came down hard and we had to run without cover from the boat in the Financial District just south of the Twin Towers to hide in a steakhouse with red leather seats and cigarette smoke<i>. Just like the movies</i>, I thought. <i>I</i> will<i> come back here. I will live here one day! I will create my own life.</i></p><p>Fifteen years later, when I realized that dream and moved to Manhattan, I instantly felt at home and that anything was possible. New York was magical to me, and it still is. Just walking down Fifth Avenue in the heat of the summer makes my heart race with excitement. It is empowering to look up at the skyscrapers, watching them defy gravity and reaching&#x2014;like all the dreamers in this city&#x2014;higher and higher.</p><p>I moved with a few Swedish friends into a one-bedroom rental apartment on Thirty-Seventh Street in midtown across from Macy&#x2019;s. I didn&#x2019;t know anyone in New York, but we Swedes felt a certain companionship in our proud but naive attempt to leave Sweden and not look back. I did miss my family, but my drive to make it in my new hometown was stronger. I kept thinking that the only time to create my future self was now. Not tomorrow. Not next month or next year. <i>Now</i>.</p><p>I got a job ...</p></p><h2>Sun &amp; Steel (Japan's Modern Writers)</h2><p>In this fascinating document, one of Japan's best known--and controversial--writers created what might be termed a new literary form. It is new because it combines elements of many existing types of writing, yet in the end fits into none of them. <p>At one level, it may be read as an account of how a puny, bookish boy discovered the importance of his own physical being; the "sun and steel" of the title are themselves symbols respectively of the cult of the open air and the weights used in bodybuilding. At another level, it is a discussion by a major novelist of the relation between action and art, and his own highly polished art in particular. More personally, it is an account of one individual's search for identity and self-integration. Or again, the work could be seen as a demonstration of how an intensely individual preoccupation can be developed into a profound philosophy of life. </p><p>All these elements are woven together by Mishima's complex yet polished and supple style. The confession and the self-analysis , the philosophy and the poetry combine in the end to create something that is in itself perfect and self-sufficient. It is a piece of literature that is as carefully fashioned as Mishima's novels, and at the same time provides an indispensable key to the understanding of them as art. </p><p>The road Mishima took to salvation is a highly personal one. Yet here, ultimately, one detects the unmistakable tones of a self transcending the particular and attaining to a poetic vision of the universal. The book is therefore a moving document, and is highly significant as a pointer to the future development of one of the most interesting novelists of modern times.</p></p><p>Yukio Mishima, one of the most spectacularly gifted writers in modern Japan, was born into a samurai family in 1925. He attended the Peers' School and Tokyo Imperial University, and for a time worked at the Ministry of Finance. His first full length novel, Confessions of a Mask, appeared in 1949, and since then he published over a dozen novels, almost all of which were translated into English and other languages during his.lifetime. They include: Thirst for Love; Forbidden Colors; Death in Midsummer; The Sound of Waves; The Temple of the Golden Pavilion; After the Banquet; The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea; and Spring Snow. <p>Mishima's reverence for the Japanese martial arts led him to take up Kendo (a type of fencing, with wooden swords) and Karate, as well as body-building, and by 1968 he had become a Kendo master of the fifth dan. He also organized a "private army" called the Shield Society, and in November 1970 he and his group forced their way into a Self-Defense Force headquarters in Tokyo, where Mishima, after reading out a proclamation, committed ritual suicide with a young follower in the commanding officer's room. On the morning of his death, the last volume of Mishima's tetralogy, The Sea of Fertility ( The Spring Snow, Runaway Horses, The Temple of Dawn, The Decay of the Angel) was delivered to his publisher. </p><p>He is survived by his wife and two children. </p><p>The Translator: John Bester, born and educated in England, is one of the foremost translators of Japanese fiction. Among his translations are Masuji Ibuse's Black Rain, Kenzaburo Oe's The Silent Cry, Fumiko Enchi's The Waiting Years, and Junnosuke Yoshiyuki's The Dark Room. He received the 1990 Noma Award for the Translation of Japanese Literature (for Mishima's Acts of Worship).</p>It happened at dusk on May 25, a beautiful day in early summer. I was attached to a parachute squad; the day's training was over; I had been for a bath, and was on my way back to the dormitory. <p>The late afternoon sky was dyed in shades of blue and pink, and the turf spread below was an even, glowing jade. Here and there on either side of the path along which I walked stood the ageing, robust, wooden buildings, nostalgic souvenirs of an age when this had been the cavalry school: the covered riding paddock, now a gymnasium, the stables, now a post-exchange.... I was still in my P.T. clothes: long white cotton training pants just issued that day, rubber gym shoes, a running shirt. Even the mud that already soiled the bottom of the pants contributed to my sense of wellbeing. </p><p>That morning's training in handling a parachute, the extraordinarily rarified feeling as for the first time one committed oneself to the empty air, still lingered inside me, a transparent residue, fragile as a medicinal wafer. The deep, rapid breathing caused by the circuit training and running that followed had pervaded my whole body with a pleasing lethargy. Rifles, weapons of every kind, were at hand. My shoulder was ready for slinging a gun at any time. I had run to my heart's content over the green grass, felt the sun burning my skin a golden brown; beneath the summer sunlight, I had seen, thirty-five feet below me, people's shadows sharply etched and firmly attached to their feet. I had jumped into space from the summit of the silver tower, aware as I went of how the shadow that I myself would cast among them the next instant would lie isolated like a black puddle on the earth, untied to my body. At that moment I was, beyond all doubt, freed from my shadow, from my self-awareness. </p><p>My day had been full to the brim of the body and of action. There was physical excitement, and strength, and sweat, and muscle; the green grass of summer was everywhere, a breeze stirred the dust on the path I walked along, the sun's rays slowly slanted ever more obliquely, and in my training pants and gym shoes I walked amidst them quite naturally. Here was the life I had wanted. At that time, I savored the same solitary, rough-and-ready joy of the physical training instructor walking back between the old school building and the shrubbery after losing himself in the beauty of physical tralnlng on a summer's evening. </p><p>I sensed in it an absolute rest for the spirit, a beatification of the flesh. Summer, white clouds, the empty blue of the sky following the final lesson of the day, and the touch of nostalgic sadness tinging the glitter of sunlight filtering through the trees, induced a sense of intoxication. I existed....</p></p><h2>Soul Survivor (A Leo Waterman Mystery)</h2><p><p><b>PI Leo Waterman is back at it&#x2014;investigating a very domestic crime that turns into a national nightmare in this upbeat page-turner of a mystery.</b></p><p>Why would a teenager with no prior record suddenly assassinate a city councilman?

Tour.</p><p>In Italy, the Nonna is vanishing. These grandmothers have lived though hard times and devoted their lives to feeding their husbands and children. When they are gone, valuable links with the past will vanish with them unless their children or grandchildren take time to learn from them. Only then will someone continue to know where to find wild greens, how dough looks when it is just right, and how to prepare the dishes these inexhaustible women have made for decades. <p> <i>In Nonna's Kitchen</i> is Carol Field's recording of the lives of some of these women and the food they cook. Whether they live in the countryside, in a small town, or in a big city, their dishes are specialties found only at home, where everything is made from scratch and it does not matter if a favorite recipe takes hours or days to make. As the title indicates, these women's stories are as important as their food. Putting the two together, Field captures both the essence of the Italian spirit and the soul of Italian cooking.</p>With life in Italy becoming increasingly urbanized and Americanized, le nonne (Italian for "the grandmothers") are the last generation that knows the rich traditions and unique dishes of the country's towns, valleys and hilltops. Carol Field goes trolling through Italy's back roads to find these true guardians of the Italian culinary heritage, and weaves their stories, wisdom and dishes together in a wonderful cookbook that celebrates their history and preserves their timeless wisdom. <p> In these pages are the authentic meals enjoyed by generations of Italians. There are savory breads such as Gnocco Ingrassato (made with crunchy cubes of pancetta), such fruit preserves as Le Pesche d'Estate (peaches in lemon and sugar syrup), sumptuous sauces like Salsa Piccante alla Senape (spicy mustard) and mouthwatering meat dishes like Agnello in Umido (braised lamb with green olives). And what's a meal without dessert? Tempting fare like Crema Bacchica (literally, Bacchuss pudding -- a cinnamon-and-clove-scented pudding flavored with wine) and Torta di Mandorle e Cioccolata (chocolate almond tart) will elicit heartfelt cheers of "magnifico" from grateful gourmets.</p></p><h2>Painting the Dream: The Shamanic Life and Art of David Chethlahe Paladin</h2><p>A glimpse into the remarkable life and visionary artwork of spiritual artist and activist David Chethlahe Paladin.<br><br>ï¿½ Looks at the spiritual traditions surrounding the images that Paladin features in his art.<br><br>ï¿½ Discusses the importance of Paladin's shamanic history in the creation of his artwork.<br><br>ï¿½ Features commentaries by Matthew Fox and others on Paladin's life and art. <br><br>David Chethlahe Paladin's art was his life; through it, he fulfilled his desire to serve, to heal, to live compassionately, and to walk the Navajo way of beauty.

Reprint. 60,000 first printing.</p><p>Under the name of William Least Heat-Moon, William Trogdon is the author of two best-selling classics BLUE HIGHWAYS and PRAIRYERTH. His newest book is RIVER-HORSE: A VOYAGE ACR0SS AMERICA. He lives in Columbia, Missouri.Along this fossil highway, even though it lies in the bottomlands <br>that have always belonged mostly to the trees, I am walking in the <br>time of the birth of the tallgrass prairie, that epoch when turfy <br>perennials - bluestems and gramas, panicums and ryes - began covering <br>the American interior as the old sea, now turned to a limestone <br>anchor, once did. Down in here, the rock is the worn concrete, yet, <br>as hard as it is, the cement road is nevertheless a fissured seedbed, <br>a string of a glade full of brand-new prairie, an extinct highway <br>giving birth to grassland.<br><br>Now: I've walked half this remnant, and I've found big bluestem and <br>little bluestem, silvery bluestem, cord grass, wild rye, sunflower, <br>bundle flower, catclaw sensitive briar, and also plants of the <br>woodlands, including a clump of garden iris from I don't know where. <br>But this strip is not a relict Pleistocene prairie because there <br>probably never was much grass in this low spot in the bottoms: a <br>vestigial highway, yes, but a new prairie. The native forbs and <br>grasses have come in on the wind and maybe on the floods, and now <br>they have roots under the pavement, and soon the prairie plants will <br>need fire to clear away the shading and moisture-sucking trees, and <br>until then the infant prairie can do little more than begin.<br><br>Prairie birth: in an earlier time, men believed the grasslands came <br>as a consequence of infertile ground, or an absence of coarse soil <br>material, or from glaciation, from bison trampling, lightning fires, <br>Indian fires, from persistent wind, drought, temperature extremes.<br><br>But Chase County has good soil of various composition, the ice sheets <br>did not reach here, and the temperature range and rainfall differ <br>only a little from the woodlands of Missouri. The other "reasons" - <br>fire, wind, grazing - contribute less to the birth of prairie than to <br>its maintenance. No: the source of the prairie is its midcontinental <br>position, far from tempering seas, where it lies under an eolian <br>cleavage zone that mixes westerlies, wrung dry by the Rocky <br>Mountains, with humid air from the Gulf: here, inches of evaporation <br>and precipitation are nearly equal, and here, above my head, the rain-<br>shadow of the Rockies meets in commensurate strength the humid Gulf <br>fronts so that this land can grow ten-foot grasses and ninety-foot <br>sycamores, and which one prevails depends mostly on one thing: fire. <br>In the last half-century, the balance has careened toward trees <br>because white men have suppressed the keeper of the grasses. To the <br>prairie, the voice of the Great Mysterious speaks in three tongues: <br>water, wind, flame. This glade beginning in the abandoned highway has <br>heard the first two, and now this slender quarter mile of incipient <br>prairie could use a tossed cigarette from a Santa Fe trackman so that <br>the highway can flourish as never before.<br><br>Copyright (C)1992 by William Least Heat-Moon.

Unintimidated by the epic sweep of Victor Hugo's life (1802-85), British scholar Graham Robb analyzes it with intelligence, wit, and enormous verve. The author wears his learning lightly as he cherry-picks the vast Hugo archives to cogently chronicle his subject's evolution from leading poet of the Romantic revolution (<i>Hernani</i>) to passionate novelist of the downtrodden (<i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>) to majestic political exile (<i>The Chastisements</i>), thundering against the tyranny of Louis-Napoleon from the Channel Islands. <i>Victor Hugo</i> is a stimulating, opinionated reassessment of France's most monumental writer.&#34;Victor Hugo&#34; was shortlisted for the 1998 Los Angeles Times Book Award in Biography.</p><h2>The Queen of the Night</h2><p><br><b>&#x201c;This book is a glorious performance . . .

Learn how to set high goals and exceed them in a big way with this easy, step-by-step approach.</p><p><b>Dr. David J. Schwartz</b> was a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta and the president of Creative Educational Services, Inc., a consulting firm specializing in leadership development.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>Believe You Can Succeed and You Will</b> </p><p> Success means many wonderful, positive things. Success means personal prosperity: a fine home, vacations, travel, new things, financial security, giving your children maximum advantages. Success means winning admiration, leadership, being looked up to by people in your business and social life. Success means freedom: freedom from worries, fears, frustrations, and failure. Success means self-respect, continually finding more real happiness and satisfaction from life, being able to do more for those who depend on you. </p><p> Success means winning. </p><p> Success -- achievement -- is the goal of life! </p><p> Every human being wants success. Everybody wants the best this life can deliver. Nobody enjoys crawling, living in mediocrity. No one likes feeling second-class and feeling forced to go that way. </p><p> Some of the most practical success-building wisdom is found in that Biblical quotation stating that faith can move mountains. </p><p> Believe, really believe, you can move a mountain and you can. Not many people believe that they can move mountains. So, as a result, not many people do. </p><p> On some occasion you've probably heard someone say something like, "It's nonsense to think you can make a mountain move away just by saying 'Mountain, move away.' It's simply impossible." </p><p> People who think this way have belief confused with wishful thinking. And true enough, you can't <i>wish</i> away a mountain. You can't <i>wish</i> yourself into an executive suite. Nor can you wish yourself into a five-bedroom, three-bath house or the high-income brackets. You can't wish yourself into a position of leadership. </p><p> But you <i>can</i> move a mountain with belief. You <i>can</i> win success by believing you can succeed. </p><p> There is nothing magical nor mystical about the power of belief. </p><p> Belief works this way. Belief, the "I'm-positive-I-can" attitude, generates the power, skill, and energy needed to do. When you believe I-can-do-it, the <i>how</i>-to-do-it develops. </p><p> Every day all over the nation young people start working in new jobs. Each of them "wishes" that someday he could enjoy the success that goes with reaching the top. But the majority of these young people simply don't have the belief that it takes to reach the top rungs. And they don't reach the top. Believing it's impossible to climb high, they do not discover the steps that lead to great heights. Their behavior remains that of the "average" person. </p><p> But a small number of these young people really believe they will succeed. They approach their work with the "I'm-going-to-the-top" attitude. And with substantial belief they reach the top. Believing they will succeed -- and that it's not impossible -- these folks study and observe the behavior of senior executives. They learn how successful people approach problems and make decisions. They observe the attitudes of successful people. </p><p> The how-to-do-it always comes to the person who believes he can do it. </p><p> A young woman I'm acquainted with decided two years ago that she was going to establish a sales agency to sell mobile homes. She was advised by many that she shouldn't -- and couldn't do it. </p><p> She had less than $3,000 in savings, and was advised the minimum capital investment required was many times that. </p><p> "Look how competitive it is," she was advised. "And besides, what practical experience have you had in selling mobile homes, let alone managing a business?" her advisors asked. </p><p> But this young lady had belief in herself and her ability to succeed. She quickly admitted she lacked capital, that the business was very competitive, and that she lacked experience. </p><p> "But," she said, "all the evidence I can gather shows that the mobile home industry is going to expand. On top of that, I've studied my competition. I know I can do a better job of merchandising trailers than anybody else in this town. I expect to make some mistakes, but I'm going to be on top in a hurry." </p><p> And she was. She had little trouble getting capital. Her absolutely unquestioned belief that she could succeed with this business won her the confidence of two investors. And armed with complete belief, she did the "impossible" -- she got a trailer manufacturer to advance her a limited inventory with no money down. </p><p> Last year she sold over $1,000,000 worth of trailers. </p><p> "Next year," she says, "I expect to gross over $2,000,000." </p><p> Belief, <i>strong belief,</i> triggers the mind to figuring ways and means and how-to. And believing you can succeed makes others place confidence in you. </p><p> Most people do not put much stock in belief. But some, the residents of Successfulville, USA, do! Just a few weeks ago a friend who is an official with a state highway department in a Midwestern state related a "mountain-moving" experience to me. </p><p> "Last month," my friend began, "our department sent notices to a number of engineering companies that we were authorized to retain some firm to design eight bridges as part of our highway building program. The bridges were to be built at a cost of $5,000,000. The engineering firm selected would get a 4 per cent commission, or $200,000, for its design work. </p><p> "I talked with 21 engineering firms about this. The four largest decided right away to submit proposals. The other 17 companies were small, having only 3 to 7 engineers each. The size of the project scared off 16 of these 17. They went over the project, shook their heads, and said in effect, 'It's too big for us. I wish I thought we could handle it, but it's no use even trying.' </p><p> "But one of these small firms, a company with only three engineers, studied the plans and said, 'We can do it. We'll submit a proposal.' They did, and they got the job." </p><p> Those who believe they can move mountains, do. Those who believe they can't, cannot. Belief triggers the power to do. </p><p> Actually, in these modem times belief is doing much bigger things than moving mountains. The most essential element -- in fact, <i>the</i> essential element -- in our space explorations today is belief that space can be mastered. Without firm, unwavering belief that man <i>can</i> travel in space, our scientists would not have the courage, interest, and enthusiasm to proceed. Belief that cancer can be cured will ultimately produce cures for cancer. Currently; there is some talk of building a tunnel under the English Channel to connect England with the Continent. Whether this tunnel is ever built depends on whether responsible people believe it can be built. </p><p> Belief in great results is the driving force, the power behind all great books, plays, scientific discoveries. Belief in success is behind every successful business, church, and political organization. Belief in success is the one basic, absolutely essential ingredient in successful people. </p><p> Believe, really believe, you can succeed and you will. </p><p> Over the years I've talked with many people who have failed in business ventures and in various careers. I've heard a lot of reasons and excuses for failure. Something especially significant unfolds as conversations with failures develop. In a casual sort of way the failure drops a remark like "To tell the truth, I didn't think it would work" or "I had my misgivings before I even started out" or "Actually, I wasn't too surprised that it didn't work out." </p><p> The "Okay-I'll-give-it-a-try-but-I-don't-think-it-will-work" attitude produces failures. </p><p> Disbelief is negative power. When the mind disbelieves or doubts, the mind attracts "reasons" to support the disbelief. Doubt, disbelief, the <i>subconscious will to fail,</i> the <i>not really wanting</i> to succeed, is responsible for most failures. </p><p> Think doubt and fail. </p><p> Think victory and succeed. </p><p> A young fiction writer talked with me recently about her writing ambitions. The name of one of the top writers in her field came up. </p><p> "Oh," she said, "Mr. X is a wonderful writer, but of course, I can't be nearly as successful as he is." </p><p> Her attitude disappointed me very much because I know the writer mentioned. He is not super-intelligent nor super-perceptive, nor super-anything else except super-confident. He believes he is among the best and so he acts and performs the best. </p><p> It is well to respect the leader. Learn from him. Observe him. Study him. But don't worship him. Believe you can surpass. Believe you can go beyond. Those who harbor the second-best attitude are invariably second-best doers. </p><p> Look at it this way. Belief is the thermostat that regulates what we accomplish in life. Study the fellow who is shuffling down there in mediocrity. He believes he is worth little, so he receives little. He believes he can't do big things, and he doesn't. He believes he is unimportant, so everything he does has an unimportant mark. As times goes by, lack of belief in himself shows through in the way the fellow talks, walks, acts. Unless he readjusts his thermostat forward, he shrinks, grows smaller and smaller in his own estimation. And, since others see in us what we see in ourselves, he grows smaller in the estimation of the people around him. </p><p> Now look across the way at the person who is advancing forward. He believes he is worth much, and he receives much. He believes he can handle big, difficult assignments -- and he does. Everything he does, the way he handles himself with people, his character, his thoughts, his viewpoints, all say, "Here is a professional. He is an important person." </p><p> A person is a product of his own thoughts. Believe Big. Adjust your thermostat forward. Launch your success offensive with honest, sincere belief that you can succeed. Believe big and grow big. </p><p> Several years ago after addressing a group of business men in Detroit, I talked with one of the gentlemen who approached me, introduced himself, and said, "I really enjoyed your talk. Can you spare a few minutes? I'd like very much to discuss a personal experience with you." </p><p> In a few minutes we were comfortably seated in a coffee shop, waiting for some refreshments. </p><p> "I have a personal experience," he began, "that ties in perfectly with what you said this evening about making your mind work for you instead of letting it work against you. I've never explained to anyone how I lifted myself out of the world of mediocrity; but I'd like to tell you about it." </p><p> "And I'd like to hear it," I said. </p><p> "Well, just five years ago I was plodding along, just another guy working in the tool-and-die trade. I made a decent living by average standards. But it was far from ideal. Our home was much too small and there was no money for those many things we wanted. My wife, bless her, didn't complain much, but it was written all over her that she was more resigned to her fate than she was happy. Inside I grew more and more dissatisfied. When I let myself see how I was failing my good wife and two children, I really hurt inside. </p><p> "But today things are really different," my friend continued. "Today we have a beautiful new home on a two-acre lot and a year-round cabin a couple hundred miles north of here. There's no more worry about whether we can send the kids to a good college and my wife no longer has to feel guilty every time she spends money for some new clothes. Next summer the whole family is flying to Europe to spend a month's holiday. We're really living." </p><p> "How did this all happen?" I asked. </p><p> "It all happened," he continued, "when to use the phrase you used tonight, 'I harnessed the power of belief.' Five years ago I learned about a job with a tool-and-die company here in Detroit. We were living in Cleveland at the time. I decided to look into it, hoping I could make a little more money. I got here early on Sunday evening, but the interview was not until Monday. </p><p> "After dinner I sat down in my hotel room and for some reason, I got really disgusted with myself. 'Why,' I asked myself, 'am I just a middle class failure? Why am I trying to get a job that represents such a small step forward?' </p><p> "I don't know to this day what prompted me to do it, but I took a sheet of hotel stationery and wrote down the names of five people I've known well for several years who had far surpassed me in earning power and job responsibility. Two were former neighbors who had moved away to fine subdivisions. Two others were fellows I had worked for, and the third was a brother-in-law. </p><p> "Next -- again I don't know what made me do this -- I asked myself what do my five friends have that I don't have, besides better jobs. I compared myself with them on intelligence, but I honestly couldn't see that they excelled in the brains department. Nor could I truthfully say they had me beat on education, integrity; or personal habits. </p><p> "Finally I got down to another success quality one hears a lot about. Initiative. Here I hated to admit it, but I had to. On this point my record showed I was far below that of my successful friends. </p><p> "It was now about 3:00 A.M., but my mind was astonishingly clear. I was seeing my weak point for the first time. I discovered that I had held back. I had always carried a little stick. I dug into myself deeper and deeper and found the reason I lacked initiative was because I didn't believe inside that I was worth very much. </p><p> "I sat there the rest of the night just reviewing how lack of faith in myself had dominated me ever since I could remember, how I had used my mind to work against myself. I found I had been preaching to myself why I couldn't get ahead instead of why I could. I had been selling myself short. I found this streak of self-depreciation showed through in everything I did. Then it dawned on me that no one else was going to believe in me until I believed in myself. </p><p> "Right then I decided, 'I'm through feeling second-class. From here on in I'm not going to sell myself short.' </p><p> "Next morning I still had that confidence. During the job interview I gave my new found confidence its first test. Before coming for the interview I'd hoped I would have courage to ask for $750 or maybe even $1000 more than my present job was paying. But now, after realizing I <i>was</i> a valuable man, I upped it to $3,500. And I got it. I sold myself because after that one long night of self-analysis I found things in myself that made me a lot more saleable. </p><p> "Within two years after I took that job I had established a reputation as the fellow who can get business. Then we went into a recession. This made me still more valuable because I was one of the best business-getters in the industry. The company was reorganized and I was given a substantial amount of stock plus a lot more pay." </p><p> Believe in yourself and good things <i>do</i> start happening. </p><p> Your mind is a "thought factory." It's a busy factory; producing countless thoughts in one day. </p><p> Production in your thought factory is under the charge of two foremen, one of whom we will call Mr. Triumph and the other Mr. Defeat. Mr. Triumph is in charge of manufacturing positive thoughts. He specializes in producing reasons why you can, why you're qualified, why you will. </p><p> The other foreman, Mr. Defeat, produces negative, depreciating tho...</p></p><h2>The Next American Metropolis: Ecology, Community, and the American Dream</h2><p>Regarding issues of urban sprawl Visit Sprawl Net, at Rice University.

Based on the prestigious Weidenfeld Lectures Roberto Calasso gave at Oxford in May 2000, <i>Literature and the Gods </i>traces the return of pagan divinities to Western literature from their first reappearance at the beginning of the modern era to their place in the literature of our own time. <br><br>Calasso sets out to uncover the divine&#x2014; godly or otherwise&#x2014;in specific texts, and finds it in what he calls "absolute literature." With its roots in early Vedic verse, absolute literature reached the apex of its expression during the period beginning with the German Romantics in 1798 and ending with Mallarmï¿½'s death in 1898. But Calasso also discovers the divine in the work of Valï¿½ry, Auden, Yeats, Montale, Borges, and Nabokov, and he reveals how these writers, in their own very particular ways, were articulating the same unnameable thing. Finally, he delineates the timeless, ever-mysterious laws that surround the creative act itself.<br><br>With <i>Literature and the Gods</i>, Roberto Calasso profoundly deepens our understanding of our literary tradition. It is, itself, a literary masterpiece.</p><p>"Roberto Calasso's survey of the renewed interest in myth demonstrates how decisive the gods' influence was on modern literature. Calasso is not only immensely learned; he is one of the most original thinkers and writers we have today." &#x2014;Charles Simic <br><br>&#x201c;Calasso can take your breath away.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>&#x201c;[A] riveting work of cultural history. . . .

After smashing Mexico&#39;s armies the young republic bestrode the North American continent like a colossus with one leg anchored on the Atlantic seaboard and the other on the Pacific. It was a bitter, hard fought war that raged across Mexico through the northern deserts, the fever-ridden Gulf cities and the balmy haciendas of California.

New historical analysis, recently discovered evidence and an innovative Scottish perspective will expose long held assumptions about the native people. This controversial text contests that Scottish history has long since been dominated and distorted by misleading perspectives. <i>A New History of the Picts</i> discredits the idea that the Picts were a strange historical anomaly and shows them to be the descendants of the original inhabitants of the land, living in a series of loose tribal confederations gradually brought together by external forces to create one of the earliest states in Europe: a people, who after repulsing all invaders, merged with their cousins, the Scots of Argyll, to create modern Scotland. All of Scotland descends from the fierce Picts.</p><p><p>STUART McHARDY is a writer, occasional broadcaster, and storyteller.

DONALD SMITH, SCOTTISH STORYTELLING CENTRE</p><h2>Crime Machine</h2><p>The long-awaited new instalment in the award-winning, bestselling John Cardinal mystery series.<br><br>A year after the death of his beloved and troubled wife, Catherine, John Cardinal has moved into a new, but very humid, condo. He has fallen into an easy routine of work on cold case files and platonic movie nights with friend and colleague Lise Delorme. The quiet of a snow-covered Algonquin Bay is shattered when the decapitated bodies of two people are found in a summer home on Trout Lake. The victims, visitors from Russia, are in Algonquin Bay attending the annual fur auction. This is by no means a routine murder investigation as Cardinal soon discovers, but a horrific piece of a very twisted puzzle. Blunt has, once again, given us a page-turning plot, a remarkable cast of characters and the comfort of John Cardinal at the helm.</p><p>GILES BLUNT grew up in North Bay, Ontario. After spending over twenty years in New York City, he now lives in Toronto. He has written scripts for <i>Law &amp; Order</i>, <i>Street Legal</i> and <i>Night Heat</i>. He is the author of <b>Forty Words for Sorrow</b>, for which he won the British Crime Writers' Macallan Silver Dagger; <b>A Delicate Storm</b>, winner of the Arthur Ellis Award for Best Novel; <b>Blackfly Season</b>, one of Margaret Cannon's Best Mysteries of the Year; <b>By the Time You Read This</b>, a national bestseller; and<b> No Such Creature</b>, one of the <i>Globe and Mail</i>'s Top Ten Crime Books.<b>1</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A small city that heralds itself as the Gateway to the North is unlikely also to be known as the gateway to fine dining, and until recently&#x2014;unless your idea of an evening out involved donuts or poutine&#x2014;this was pretty much the case with Algonquin Bay. Many an intrepid restaurateur had been brought to ruin by the economic realities of trying to serve fresh Atlantic salmon, not to mention an edible tomato, 340 kilometres north of Toronto. But they kept trying, and this particular year at least three restaurants&#x2014;two steakhouses, as well as Bistro Champlain&#x2014;were vying for the attention of local gourmands.<br>&nbsp;<br>Of these, Bistro Champlain was by far the most successful. Partly this was the work of Jerry Wing, its creative chef, but being located across the highway from a first-class ski resort called the Highlands didn&#x2019;t hurt. When the Highlands did well, Bistro Champlain did well&#x2014;and right now it was doing very well indeed, owing to the winter fur auction. Buyers from all over the world had descended on Algonquin Bay to bid on hundreds of thousands of furs that would end up in showrooms from Manhattan to Moscow to Beijing. Champlain&#x2019;s dining room may have maintained its luxurious hush, but for a couple of hours the kitchen had been a scene of barely controlled chaos.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was nearly ten, and Sam Doucette had just plated what she hoped was the last order for the night: the maple venison, accompanied by sweet potato mash and a red wine reduction. The rush was over, and the decibel level of slamming skillets, pans and ramekins had finally settled below the pain threshold. Jerry had already gone home, and Sam was praying that Ken, the manager, would not seat some late arrival with a huge appetite. Working as a cook&#x2014;a skill her mother had taught her&#x2014;was supposed to be part-time, a way of subsidizing her art classes at Algonquin College, but for the past few nights she had been doing the work of two cooks, one of her colleagues having been summarily fired for attempting to exit the premises with two hams stuffed in his backpack. All but two of the waiters, Ali and Jeff, had gone home, and Sam couldn&#x2019;t wait to get out of there.<br>&nbsp;<br>She rested one foot on the bottom of an upturned pickle bucket and wiped the sweat from her brow with the sleeve of her chef &#x2019;s tunic. Would Randall call? If he called, fine. If not . . . well, she didn&#x2019;t want to think about that. Romance, she was discovering, was not uninterrupted bliss; mostly, it was uninterrupted anxiety. So she turned her mind to Loreena Moon, the heroine of a graphic novel she was drawing and writing just for fun. Well, she told herself it was just for fun&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t want to get all worked up thinking about actually selling it&#x2014;but she was also toying with the idea that it might be a series. She had already drawn lots of images and written several scenes. For some reason, the imaginary Loreena Moon was clearer in Sam&#x2019;s mind than anything about her real life, except Randall and his passionate kisses.<br>&nbsp;<br>Loreena Moon was cool, aloof, self-reliant&#x2014;everything Sam was not. She moved through the shadows of the city, a perpetual frown of suspicion darkening her brow. She carried a knife in a fringed sheath on her hip, a quiver of arrows at her shoulder, and a small bow slung across her back. She was always outraged, always righting wrongs and saving helpless people, wronged people. Loreena never looked back and she was never, ever in love. She was the same age as Sam, eighteen, but she didn&#x2019;t live on the reserve and she didn&#x2019;t live in Algonquin Bay. Sam was not yet sure <i>where </i>Loreena Moon lived. It couldn&#x2019;t be a house or an apartment; no bills or personal responsibilities for Loreena. The only place Sam could imagine her staying was in hotel rooms, and never the same one twice.<br>&nbsp;<br>The kitchen clock hit ten, ending Champlain&#x2019;s food service for the night. Sam&#x2019;s cellphone rang in the breast pocket of her tunic and her heart gave a skip of happiness. The tiny screen said <i>Randall Wishart</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We have a place,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Please tell me we have a place. I&#x2019;ve missed you so much.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; Randall said. &#x201c;Come to the Island Road house. How long will you be?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m done here. I just have to set up for the lunch crew.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Park some ways away,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and don&#x2019;t let anybody see you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam turned off the deep fryer, the ovens and ranges. She had already wiped down the counters and cutting boards. Ken McCoy, the manager, stuck his head in from the dining room and gave her the okay signal.<br>&nbsp;<br>She changed in a supply closet behind the kitchen. The white tunic came off and went into the laundry bin, followed by the ridiculous check pants. Loreena was always in black jeans and tank top, sometimes a black T-shirt, maybe with a cat logo or a lightning bolt. Sam&#x2019;s own jeans were a struggle, she was so sweaty from the stove. She pulled on the soft red sweater that she knew Randall liked, slung her coat over her arm and went out the back door to the parking lot.<br>&nbsp;<br>The night was fine, the snap and sparkle of December without the face-freezing cold that January would soon bring. Loreena Moon would have hopped on her Kawasaki, but Sam had to be careful getting into her &#x2019;96 Civic. The door had to be lifted just so as you opened it or the hinge would go out of whack and the thing would refuse to close.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Island Road property was out on Trout Lake, at the tip of a point it had all to itself. In summer there might have been people cruising by in boats, people driving back and forth to their cottages, but this time of yearit was dead quiet. Even so, Randall opened the door the way he always did, standing behind it so he couldn&#x2019;t be glimpsed by any chance passerby. He was still wearing one of the dark sports jackets he favoured for work, but he had taken his tie off and, seeing Sam, his face lit up like a hot young actor&#x2019;s at the Academy Awards. The moment Sam was inside, he took her in his arms and hugged her tight.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Three whole days,&#x201d; Sam said. &#x201c;I was going crazy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Did anyone see you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you park?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The hydro turnoff you showed me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Cool.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The house was a bungalow, very open and lots of polished wood everywhere. Too pretty for Loreena, but Sam liked it just fine. She hoped the owners never came back. She took off her boots and hung up her coat in the vestibule and Randall hugged her again. He switched off the vestibule light and they went to the bedroom and got undressed, Sam draping her stuff on a wooden chair by the closet.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Jane have nice body,&#x201d; Randall said. &#x201c;Tarzan like.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I wish I could take a shower. I&#x2019;m all sweaty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Me like all sweaty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They lay down on the blue blanket Randall always brought to cover whatever bed they happened to use. He kept it in his car and Sam occasionally wondered how he explained its presence there to his wife. He stretched out naked, hands behind his head, showing off his biceps. Sam loved his body. Loved it in a way she was sure you should never love anything of this world. She had always thought love would be a melding of minds, a union of souls, and until she slept with Randall Wishart she had never considered the possibility that you could be positively loony over the sheer physicality of another human being.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam straddled Randall&#x2019;s chest, pinioning his arms. Her hands looked dark against his so not-Native skin. &#x201c;I think about you all the time,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Me too.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, I mean really, really all the time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;If I could draw like you, I&#x2019;d draw you over and over again, all day long.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam touched his cheek. It was always smooth. Randall never allowed the slightest stubble. He would have considered it unprofessional in a realtor.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I think about your voice,&#x201d; she said, touching his neck. &#x201c;Sometimes I even hear it in my sleep.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh yeah? What am I saying?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you.&#x201d; She covered her face.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Come on, what am I saying?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam shook her head.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know what I say.&#x201d; He tilted her off and put his lips to her ear and whispered a string of outrageous commands and nipped at her earlobe. That started their usual delirious tangle, which after six months still had the power to leave Sam breathless and amazed. Randall always found just the right touch, the exact timing that could drive her pleasure up and over thresholds whose existence she hadn&#x2019;t even suspected. Was it just because he was older? Or did he have some kind of gift? Or was it&#x2014;maybe, oh, she hoped so&#x2014;because he really, totally, absolutely loved her? A Force Ten orgasm in no time at all.<br>&nbsp;<br>He fell away from her, gasping and laughing. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it. I swear. That was the one. I&#x2019;m never going to need another one. That was it for all time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sam laughed. &#x201c;They ought to have an Olympic event. The hundred-metre orgasm.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Synchronized orgasms.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They were laughing, but Sam was already beginning to feel sad the way she always did afterward. Sad that Randall would be going home to his wife. Sad that she would be going home to her mother and her little brother and her self-absorbed art instructors at Algonquin. Most of her friends had left town for universities farther afield. Her dad was off on one of his winter camping trips, hunting ...</p><h2>Alice&#39;s Tulips: A Novel</h2><p><br>Alice Bullock is a young newlywed whose husband, Charlie, has just joined the Union Army, leaving her on his Iowa farm with only his formidable mother for company. Equally talented at sewing and gossip, and not overly fond of hard work, Alice writes lively letters to her sister filled with accounts of local quilting bees, the rigors of farm life, and the customs of small-town America. But no town is too small for intrigue and treachery, and when Alice finds herself accused of murder, she must rely on support from unlikely sources.<br><br>Rich in details of quilting, Civil War-era America, and the realities of a woman's life in the nineteenth century, <i>Alice's Tulips</i> is Sandra Dallas at her best, a dramatic and heartwarming tale of friendship, adversity, and triumph.<br><br></p><p><br>Sandra Dallas is the author of <i>Buster's Midnight Cafe, The Persian Pickle Club, </i>and <i>The Diary of Mattie Spenser</i>. She lives in Denver, Colorado.<br><br>Loyalty, trust and friendship are the themes of Dallas's (The Persian Pickle Club) cozy, suspense-driven epistolary novel, set during the Civil War. When her husband enlists as a Union soldier, teenage newlywed Alice Keeler Bullock must live on his family's Bramble Farm on the outskirts of Slatyfork, Iowa, with only her stern mother-in-law, Mother (Serena) Bullock, for company. Alice is lonely without the constant companionship of her sister, Lizzie, and their six younger brothers. She passes the time writing long, gossip-filled letters to Lizzie in Galena, Ill., and growing passionate about her quilting. Newly pregnant, Alice hopes that the baby will win over her fault-finding mother-in-law, but Alice doesn't make things easy for herself. She regularly boasts about her superior sewing skills, yearns aloud for fashionable clothing and speaks before she thinks. In other words, she is young and ignorant of the ways of the world, which leads to trouble with a Confederate sympathizer, Samuel Smead, who, encouraged by Alice's innocent flirtations, pursues her with an intensity that tarnishes her reputation. Meanwhile, Alice slowly makes friends with girls her own age, including Samuel's sister-in-law, Nealie, and a runaway mother, Annie, seeking shelter for herself and her blind daughter. As the story unfolds, secrets and mysteries abound, and Alice shares every joy and sorrow with her sister by letter, a credible narrative form except when Alice reproduces extended dialogue. The last third of the novel is a delicate balance between sentiment and tragedy; in some instances, the secrets spilled go over the top, with no adequate motives for why characters are so cruel. Alice is a feisty Northern counterpart to Scarlett O'Hara, however, and her irreverent humor and precise expression will keep readers entertained. First serial to Good Housekeeping; author tour.

This book is a valuable guide." --</strong>Elisabeth Elliot</p> <p><strong>"This book goes to the center of all that it means to be a godly woman. Every American woman should have the opportunity to read it." --</strong>D. James Kennedy</p> <p>Have you sensed God's call to change your world? Do you believe you can be one of those women who, by her virtue, wisdom, dignity, and faith, makes an impact in her home and community?</p> <p>Maybe you've heard the call but weren't sure how to maximize the opportunities God has given you. Maybe society's definition of "true womanhood"--claiming it's about reproductive rights, doing things "your way," assuming the power, and gaining control of your life--has clouded your view of who you are in Christ.

While the principles have circulated for years, a translation of the accompanying commentary has never found its way into publication--until now. </p><p>Master Funakoshi's approach stresses spiritual considerations and mental agility over brute strength and technique. Practitioners should not rely on technique alone--striking, kicking, blocking--but must nurture the spiritual aspects of their practice as well. Attend to yourself and the rest will follow, was the message he set for posterity over sixty years ago. </p><p>As axioms, Funakoshi's principles are open to various interpretations. "There is no first attack in karate" has occasioned endless discussion about its true meaning. Many of these ambiguities are clarified in the commentary, which is also filled with philosophical musings, fascinating historical episodes, and advice for anyone seeking a better Way. </p><p>Translated for the first time into English by John Teramoto, a karate practitioner himself, and accompanied by original calligraphy, this long-awaited treatise is a provocative read and, for martial arts enthusiasts, a long overdue godsend.</p><br>GICHIN FUNAKOSHI (1868-1957) is one of karate's great masters. Born in Okinawa, the birthplace of karate, he began training in the secret martial art as a child. In 1922, at the request of the Japanese government, he demonstrated the still-secret Okinawan art of self-defence on the Japanese mainland, which led to karate's introduction to the rest of Japan and subsequently the rest of the world. Funakoshi devoted the remainder of his life to this traditional sport and wrote several classics on the subject, including Karate-do Kyohan and Karate Jutsu, as well as an autobiography entitled <em>Karate-do: My Way of Life</em>.<br><br>GENWA NAKASONE (1895-1978), between stints as a schoolteacher and a politician, was an editor and publisher of books on karate and martial arts, among them Karate-do Taikan, a ground-breaking compendium of karate texts and documents. Born in Okinawa, he was an early supporter of Funakoshi, and in an ideal position to compile accurate annotations of the master's twenty principles.<br><br>JOHN TERAMOTO was born in Los Angeles, California, and began karate training at the age of 13 under Tsutomu Oshima, reaching the rank of godan in 1990.

Perry "matriculated as a barn-booted bumpkin who still marks a second-place finish in the sixth-grade spelling bee as an intellectual pinnacle . . . and once said hello to Merle Haggard on a golf cart."</p><p>Written in a spirit of exploration rather than declaration, <em>Montaigne in Barn Boots</em> is a down-to-earth (how do you pronounce that last name?) look into the ideas of a philosopher "ensconced in a castle tower overlooking his vineyard," channeled by a midwestern American writing "in a room above the garage overlooking a disused pig pen." Whether grabbing an electrified fence, fighting fires, failing to fix a truck, or feeding chickens, Perry draws on each experience to explore subjects as diverse as faith, race, sex, aromatherapy, and Prince.

The answer is a resounding yes. In late 2004, leading Western scientists joined the Dalai Lama at his home in Dharamsala, India, to address this very question&#x2013;and in the process brought about a revolution in our understanding of the human mind. In this fascinating and far-reaching book, Wall Street Journal science writer Sharon Begley reports on how cutting-edge science and the ancient wisdom of Buddhism have come together to show how we all have the power to literally change our brains by changing our minds. These findings hold exciting implications for personal transformation.<br><br>For decades, the conventional wisdom of neuroscience held that the hardware of the brain is fixed and immutable&#x2013;that we are stuck with what we were born with. As Begley shows, however, recent pioneering experiments in neuroplasticity, a new science that investigates whether and how the brain can undergo wholesale change, reveal that the brain is capable not only of altering its structure but also of generating new neurons, even into old age. The brain can adapt, heal, renew itself after trauma, and compensate for disability. <br><br>Begley documents how this fundamental paradigm shift is transforming both our understanding of the human mind and our approach to deep-seated emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems. These breakthroughs show that it is possible to reset our happiness meter, regain the use of limbs disabled by stroke, train the mind to break cycles of depression and OCD, and reverse age-related changes in the brain. They also suggest that it is possible to teach and learn compassion, a key step in the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s quest for a more peaceful world. But as we learn from studies performed on Buddhist monks, an important component in changing the brain is to tap the power of mind and, in particular, focused attention. This is the classic Buddhist practice of mindfulness, a technique that has become popular in the West and that is immediately available to everyone. <br><br>With her extraordinary gift for making science accessible, meaningful, and compelling, Sharon Begley illuminates a profound shift in our understanding of how the brain and the mind interact. This tremendously hopeful book takes us to the leading edge of a revolution in what it means to be human.</p><p>Sharon Begley, science columnist for The Wall Street Journal, inaugurated the paper&#x2019;s &#x201c;Science Journal&#x201d; in 2002.

The mist-veiled peaks of the Dhauladhar (&#x201c;white ridge&#x201d;) range hug the towns like the bolster on a giant&#x2019;s bed, while the Kangra Valley, described by a British colonial official as &#x201c;a picture of rural loveliness and repose,&#x201d; stretches into the distance. Upper Dharamsala is also known as McLeod Ganj. Founded as a hill station in the nineteenth century during the days of British colonial rule, the bustling hamlet (named after Britain&#x2019;s lieutenant governor of Punjab at the time, David McLeod) is built on a ridge, where hiking the steep dirt path from one guesthouse to another requires the sure-footedness of a goat and astute enough planning that you don&#x2019;t make the ankle-turning trek after dark and risk tumbling into a ravine.<br><br>Cows amble through intersections where street peddlers squat behind cloths piled with vegetables and grains, and taxis play a game of chicken with oncoming traffic, seeing who will lose his manhood first by edging his car out of the single lane of the town&#x2019;s only real thoroughfare. The road curves past beggars and holy men who wear little but a loincloth and look as if they have not eaten since last week, yet whose many woes are neatly listed on a computer printout that they hopefully thrust at any passerby who slows even half a pace. Barefoot children dart out of nowhere at the sight of a Westerner and plead, &#x201c;Please, madam, hungry baby, hungry baby,&#x201d; pointing vaguely toward the open-air stalls that line the road.<br><br>From the flagstoned terrace of Chonor House, one of the guesthouses, all of Dharamsala spreads out before you. As soon as the sun is up, the maroon-robed monks are scurrying to prayers and the holy men crouched in back alleys are chanting om mani padme hum (&#x201c;hail to jewel in the lotus&#x201d;). Prayer scarves fluttering from boughs carry the Tibetan words May all sentient beings be happy and free from suffering. The prayers are supposed to be carried by the wind, and when you see them, you think, Wherever the wind blows, may those they touch find freedom from their pain.<br><br>Although lower Dharamsala is inhabited mostly by Indians, residents of McLeod Ganj are almost all Tibetan (with a sprinkling of Western expatriates and spiritual tourists), refugees who followed Tenzin Gyatso, the fourteenth Dalai Lama, into exile. Many of those remaining in Tibet, unable to flee themselves, have their toddlers and even infants smuggled across the border to Dharamsala, where they are cared for and educated at the Tibetan Children&#x2019;s Village ten minutes above the town. For the parents, the price of ensuring that their children are educated in Tibetan culture and history, thus keeping their nation&#x2019;s traditions and identity from being erased by the Chinese occupation, is never seeing their sons and daughters again.<br><br>McLeod Ganj has been the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s home in exile and the headquarters of the Tibetan government in exile since 1959, when he escaped ahead of Chinese Communist troops, which had invaded Tibet eight years earlier. His compound, just off the main intersection where buses turn around and taxis wait for fares, is protected around the clock by Indian troops toting machine guns. The entrance is a tiny hut whose physical presence is as humble as the guards are thorough. From its anteroom, large enough for only a small sofa, dog-eared publications in a wooden rack, and a small coffee table, you pass through a door into the security room, where you place everything you want to bring in (bags, notebooks, cameras, tape recorders) on the X-ray belt before entering a closet-size booth, curtained at both ends, for the requisite pat-down by Tibetan guards.<br><br>Once cleared, you amble up an inclined asphalt path that winds past more Indian security guards draped with submachine guns and lounging in the shade. The sprawling grounds are forested with pines and rhododendrons; ceramic pots spilling purple bougainvillea and saffron marigolds surround the widely spaced buildings. The first structure to your right is a one-story building that houses the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s audience chamber, also guarded by an Indian soldier with an automatic weapon. Just beyond is the Tibetan library and archives, and farther up the hill, the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s two-story private compound, where he sleeps, meditates, and takes most of his meals. The large structure to the left is the old palace where the Dalai Lama lived before his current residence was built. Mostly used for ordinations, for the next five days its large main room will be the setting for an extraordinary meeting. Brought together by the Mind and Life Institute in October 2004, leading scholars from both the Buddhist and the Western scientific traditions will grapple with a question that has consumed philosophers and scientists for centuries: does the brain have the ability to change, and what is the power of the mind to change it?<br><br>Hardwired Dogma<br><br>Just a few years before, neuroscientists would not even have been part of this conversation, for textbooks, science courses, and cutting-edge research papers all hewed to the same line, as they had for almost as long as there had been a science of the brain. <br><br>No less a personage than William James, the father of experimental psychology in the United States, first introduced the word plasticity to the science of the brain, positing in 1890 that &#x201c;organic matter, especially nervous tissue, seems endowed with a very extraordinary degree of plasticity.&#x201d; By that, he meant &#x201c;a structure weak enough to yield to an influence.&#x201d; But James was &#x201c;only&#x201d; a psychologist, not a neurologist (there was no such thing as a neuroscientist a century ago), and his speculation went nowhere. Much more influential was the view expressed succinctly in 1913 by Santiago Ramï¿½n y Cajal, the great Spanish neuroanatomist who had won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine seven years earlier. Near the conclusion of his treatise on the nervous system, he declared, &#x201c;In the adult centers the nerve paths are something fixed, ended and immutable.&#x201d; His gloomy assessment that the circuits of the living brain are unchanging, its structures and organization almost as static and stationary as a deathly white cadaver brain floating in a vat of formaldehyde, remained the prevailing dogma in neuroscience for almost a century. The textbook wis- dom held that the adult brain is hardwired, fixed in form and function, so that by the time we reach adulthood, we are pretty much stuck with what we have.<br><br>Conventional wisdom in neuroscience held that the adult mammalian brain is fixed in two respects: no new neurons are born in it, and the functions of the structures that make it up are immutable, so that if genes and development dictate that this cluster of neurons will process signals from the eye, and this cluster will move the fingers of the right hand, then by god they&#x2019;ll do that and nothing else come hell or high water. There was good reason why all those extravagantly illustrated brain books show the function, size, and location of the brain&#x2019;s structures in permanent ink. As late as 1999, neurologists writing in the prestigious journal Science admitted, &#x201c;We are still taught that the fully mature brain lacks the intrinsic mechanisms needed to replenish neurons and reestablish neuronal networks after acute injury or in response to the insidious loss of neurons seen in neurodegen- erative diseases.&#x201d;<br><br>That is not to say that scientists failed to recognize that the brain must undergo some changes throughout life. After all, since the brain is the organ of behavior and the repository of learning and memory, when we acquire new knowledge or master a new skill or file away the remembrance of things past, the brain changes in some real, physical way to make that happen. Indeed, researchers have known for decades that learning and memory find their physiological expression in the formation of new synapses (points of connection between neurons) and the strengthening of existing ones; in 2000, the wise men of Stockholm even awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the molecular underpinnings of memory.<br><br>But the changes underlying learning and memory are of the retail variety&#x2014;strengthening a few synapses here and there or sprouting a few extra dendrites so neurons can talk to more of their neighbors, like a household getting an extra phone line. Wholesale changes, such as expanding a region that is in charge of a particular mental function or altering the wiring that connects one region to another, were deemed impossible.<br><br>Also impossible was for the basic layout of the brain to deviate one iota from the authoritative diagrams in anatomy textbooks: the visual cortex in the back was hardwired to handle the sense of sight, the somatosensory cortex curving along the top of the brain was hardwired to process tactile sensations, the motor cortex was hardwired to devote a precise amount of neural real estate to each muscle, and the auditory cortex was hardwired to field transmissions from the ears. Enshrined from clinical practice to scholarly monographs, this principle held that in contrast to the ability of the developing brain to change in significant ways, the adult brain is fixed, immutable. It has lost the capacity called neuroplasticity, the ability to change its structures and functions in a fundamental way.<br><br>To some extent, the dogma was understandable. For one thing, the human brain is made up of so many neurons and so many connections&#x2014;an estimated 100 billion neurons making a total of some 100 trillion connections&#x2014;that changing it even slightly looked like a risky undertaking, on a par with opening up the hard drive of a supercomputer and tinkering with a circuit or two on the motherboard. Surely that was not the sort of thing nature would permit and...</p><h2>A Proud American: The Autobiography of Joe Foss</h2><p>A military hero, two-term governor of South Dakota, first and only commissioner of the American Football League, and president of the National Rifle Association looks back on his life, career, and accomplishments. Tour.</p><p>WW II hero Foss (as a Marine pilot, he shot down 26 Japanese planes) went on to serve two terms as governor of South Dakota, as commissioner of the American Football League and host of the TV series The American Sportsman and The Outdoorsman. The first half of his autobiography--written with his wife--is a conventional, entertaining account of his upbringing on a Midwestern farm, his introduction to flying in the 1930s and his wartime aerial exploits. The second half disappoints as Foss jumps from one event to the next in a kind of outline of his multiple postwar careers. A man of action, Foss offers fairly unsurprising observations, with two exceptions. The first of these is his eyewitness testimony that future senator Joseph McCarthy participated in dangerous air missions in the South Pacific; the second is his defense of his friend the late Charles Lindbergh against charges of disloyalty and anti-Semitism. With a fairly ingenuous charm, Foss highlights his receiving the Medal of Honor from FDR and the thrill of being interviewed by Lawrence Welk. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Boy Who Met Jesus: Segatashya of Kibeho</h2><p>No matter what your faith or religious beliefs, The Boy Who Met Jesus will bring you comfort and joy, and prepare your heart for this life...and for life everlasting</p><p><p><b>Immaculï¿½e Ilibagiza,</b> the author of <i>Left to Tell,</i> <i>Led by Faith,</i> and <i>Our Lady of Kibeho</i> (with Steve Erwin)<i>,</i> was born in Rwanda and studied electronic and mechanical engineering at the National University.

"If literature were judged solely by its ability to elicit strong emotions," Kirkus Reviews said about <b>One True Thing</b>, "columnist-cum-novelist Quindlen would win another Pulitzer."&nbsp;&nbsp;And the same will be said about <b>Black and Blue</b>, a brilliant novel of suspense, substance, and importance.<br><br>In <b>Black and Blue</b>, Fran Benedetto tells a spellbinding story: how at nineteen she fell in love with Bobby Benedetto, how their passionate marriage became a nightmare, why she stayed, and what happened on the night she finally decided to run away with her ten-year-old son and start a new life under a new name. Living in fear in Florida--yet with increasing confidence, freedom, and hope--Fran unravels the complex threads of family, identity, and desire that shape a woman's life, even as she begins to create a new one. As Fran starts to heal from the pain of the past, she almost believes she has escaped it--that Bobby Benedetto will not find her and again provoke the complex combustion between them of attraction and destruction, lust and love.<br><br><b>Black and Blue</b> is a beautifully written, heart-stopping story in which Anna Quindlen writes with power, wisdom, and humor about the real lives of men and women, the varieties of people and love, the bonds between mother and child, the solace of family and friendship, the inexplicable feelings between people who are passionately connected in ways they don't understand. It is a remarkable work of fiction by the writer whom Alice Hoffman has called "a national treasure."</p><p><b>Oprah Book Clubï¿½ Selection, April 1998</b>: "The first time my husband hit me I was nineteen years old," begins Fran Benedetto, the broken heroine of Anna Quindlen's <i>Black and Blue</i>. With one sweeping sentence, the door to an abused and tortured world is swung wide open and the psyche of a crushed and tattered self-image exposed. "Frannie, Frannie, Fran"--as Bobby Benedetto liked to call her before smashing her into kitchen appliances--was a young, energetic nursing student when she met her husband-to-be at a local Brooklyn bar. She was instantly captivated by his dark, brooding looks and magnetic personality, but her fascination soon solidified into a marital prison sentence of incessant abuse and the destruction of her own identity. After an especially horrific beating and rape, Fran realizes that the next attack could be the last. Fearing her son would be left alone with Bobby, she escapes one morning with her child. Fran's salvation comes in the form of Patty Bancroft and Co., a relocation agency for abused women that touts better service than the witness protection program. Armed only with a phone number, a few hundred dollars, and the help of several anonymous volunteers, Fran begins a new life. The agency relocates her to Florida, where she becomes Beth Crenshaw, a recently divorced home-care assistant from Delaware. Fran and her son adapt, meeting challenges with unexpected resilience and resolve until their past returns to haunt them. Quindlen renders the intricacies of spousal abuse with eerie accuracy, taking the reader deep within the realm of dysfunctional human ties. However, her vivid descriptions of abuse, emotional disintegration, and acute loneliness at times numb the reader with their realism."First rate.

Bronfman. This Haggadah will inspire and delight all ages. Designed to foster Jewish pride, Edgar Bronfman&#x2019;s text continues the traditional commandment to retell the Exodus story of slavery and freedom for future generations. The Haggadah teaches people of all ages about Judaism with a fresh perspective while helping to define Passover for everyone at the Seder table. The author&#x2019;s creative approach weaves together meaningful readings, from the nineteenth-century abolitionist Frederick Douglas to a lesser-known poet, Marge Piercy. Bronfman captures the young reader&#x2019;s imagination when each child, teenager, and adult assumes the role of a character in the Exodus story, or perhaps to become one of the story&#x2019;s narrators. Watercolor paintings, created specially for this book, illustrate its main parts: the Seder plate&#x2019;s symbolic foods, the parting of the Red Sea, the forty-year journey, the giving of the ten commandments on Mount Sinai, to name a few. The Bronfman Haggadah is a welcome addition for the avid collector, as well as to be used as the Haggadah of choice to enrich the Passover Seder experience with its refreshing interactive approach.</p><p>Formerly CEO of the Seagram Company Ltd, Edgar M. Bronfman is a renowned philanthropist and Jewish leader. Through The Samuel Bronfman Foundation, he supports initiatives that inspire a renaissance in Jewish life. He served as president of the World Jewish Congress and as president of the World Jewish Restitution Organization. He has received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country&#x2019;s highest civilian honor. New York&#x2013;based artist Jan Aronson has had more than forty solo exhibitions and numerous group exhibitions.<b>Festival Candles and Blessings</b><br>&nbsp;<br>LEADER: &nbsp;One of the most intriguing aspects of the Seder is how it conveys ideas through physical, verbal, and musical modes. The Seder officially begins with a physical action: the lighting of candles. In ancient times, candles&#x2014;or, most probably, oil lamps&#x2014;were the only source of light after sunset.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since Jewish holy days always begin after sunset, lights were necessary for any observance. The candles remain an important part of our ceremony&#x2014;their wavering fire reminds us of the importance of keeping the fragile flame of freedom alive in the world.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>(Leader asks that the candles be lit while reciting the blessing.)</i><br>&nbsp;<br>We gather together to tell the story of our ancestor&#x2019;s freedom from bondage in Egypt, for it is written: you shall celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread and observe this day from generation to generation.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we light the festival candles, we acknowledge that as match, wick, and wax brighten our Passover table, good thoughts, good words, and good deeds brighten our days.<br>&nbsp;<br>LEADER: We now say Kiddush&#x2014;a blessing that designates a person, place, thing, or time for a higher purpose.<br>&nbsp;<br>CELEBRANTS IN UNISON: There is no beautifier of complexion, or form, or behavior like the wish to scatter joy and not pain around us.&#x2014;Ralph Waldo Emerson<br>&nbsp;<br>LEADER: Along with celebrating our ancestor&#x2019;s deliverance from bitter bondage in Egypt, the Passover holiday highlights the importance of hope. And what better time to celebrate hope than spring? <br>&nbsp;<br>Understanding this, our sages wisely folded the Passover celebration into the ancient Israelite agricultural event Hag Ha Aviv&#x2014;the Holiday of Spring. As life breaks free of winter&#x2019;s icy locks, we are reminded of our capacity for renewal. In homage to this season of rebirth, we read a short passage from the Song of Songs, a love song in the Hebrew Bible:<br>&nbsp;<br>CELEBRANTS IN UNISON:<br>For, lo, the winter is past<br>the rain is over and gone;<br>The flowers appear on the earth,<br>the time of singing is come,<br>and the voice of the turtledove<br>is heard in our land;<br>The fig-tree puts forth<br>green figs, and the<br>budded bough, its fragrance.<br>&nbsp;<br>LEADER: These images of fragrant blooms call our attention to another kind of bud: our children. Through them, the Jewish people&#x2014;indeed, all people&#x2014;break free of time&#x2019;s sheath and unfurl into the future. We drink to their health and happiness and offer them this blessing: (Leader and celebrants raise first cup of wine.)<br>&nbsp;<br>CELEBRANTS IN UNISON:<br>May you enjoy freedom of speech<br>May you enjoy freedom of worship<br>May you enjoy freedom from want<br>May you enjoy freedom from fear<br>&#x2014;Franklin Delano Roosevelt<br>&nbsp;<br>May you enjoy the freedom to dream<br>&#x2014;Samuel Bronfman<br>&nbsp;<br><i>(Leader and celebrants drink first cup of wine.)<br></i></p><h2>Gladys: Duchess of Marlborough</h2><p>Hardcover book about the Duchess Gladys of Marlborough.</p><p></p><h2>Holy Scripture (Studies in Dogmatics)</h2><p>In this series rooted in the normative significance of Scripture, noted Dutch theologian G.

A good place to start is with the first Vorkosigan story, <i>Shards of Honor</i>.</p><i>Author's Note</i>:<br>&nbsp;<br><b>A Bujold Reading-Order Guide</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>The Fantasy Novels</b><br>&nbsp;<br>My fantasy novels are not hard to order. Easiest of all is <i>The Spirit Ring</i>, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed books thatfor some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Nexteasiest are the four volumes of <i>The Sharing Knife--</i>in order, <i>Beguilement</i>, <i>Legacy</i>, <i>Passage</i>, and <i>Horizon--</i>which I broke down and actually numbered, as this is one continuous tale.<br>&nbsp;<br>What were called the Chalion books after the setting of its first twovolumes, but which now that the geographic scope has widened I'm dubbing the World of the Five Gods, were written to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole.&nbsp; However, the second volume certainly contains spoilersfor the first, so <i>Curse-Paladin</i> is the recommended readingorder.&nbsp; The third is in effect an independent prequel, not sharingcharacters or setting with the other two, so readers of the priorvolumes need to adjust their expectations going in. In any case, thepublication order is:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Curse of Chalion</i><br><i>Paladin of Souls</i><br><i>The Hallowed Hunt</i><br>In terms of internal world chronology, <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i> would fall first, the Penric novellas perhaps a hundred and fifty years later, and <i>The Curse of Chalion</i> and <i>Paladin of Souls</i> would follow a century or so after that.<br><br>Current internal chronology of the Penric &amp; Desdemona tales is:<br><br>"Penric's Demon"<br>"Penric and the Shaman"<br>"Penric's Fox"<br>"Penric's Mission"<br>"Mira's Last Dance"<br><b>Other Original E-books</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The short story collection <i>ProtoZoa</i> contains five very early tales--three (1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but not in this handy format. The novelette "Dreamweaver's Dilemma" may be of interest to Vorkosigancompletists, as it is the first story in which that proto-universebegan, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even thought of.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Sidelines:Talks and Essays</i> is just what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of mynonfiction writings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions, and some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove aninteresting companion piece to my fiction.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>The Vorkosigan Stories</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Many pixels have been expended debating the 'best' order in which to readwhat have come to be known as the Vorkosigan Books (or Saga), theVorkosiverse, the Miles books, and other names. The debate mainlyrevolves around publication order versus internal-chronological order. I favor internal chronological, with a few adjustments.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Shards of Honor</i> and <i>Barrayar.</i> The first two books in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar. <i>Shards</i> was my very first novel ever; <i>Barrayar</i> was actually my eighth, but continues the tale the next day after the end of <i>Shards</i>. For readers who want to be sure of beginning at the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> and <i>The Vor Game</i> (with, perhaps, the novella "The Mountains of Mourning" tucked in between.) <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> introduces the character who became the series' linchpin, MilesVorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a space mercenary fleetby accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other thingsone can best discover for oneself), <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> makes another good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist.<br>&nbsp;<br>After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>Mirror Dance</i>, and both, ideally, before <i>Memory.</i><br>&nbsp;<br><i>Komarr</i> makes another alternate entry point for the series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read before <i>A Civil Campaign</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of the five currently extant novellas, makes agood Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure sampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit themselves to length. (But it maymake more sense if read after <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>.) Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not sharesettings or characters with the main body of the series. Most readersrecommend picking up this story later. It should likely be read before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however,which revisits the "quaddies", a bioengineered race of free-fall dwellers, in Miles's time.<br>&nbsp;<br>The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear in italics; thenovellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 word sand 40,000words) in quote marks.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Falling Free</i><br><i>Shards of Honor</i><br><i>Barrayar</i><br><i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i><br>"The Mountains of Mourning"<br>"Weatherman"<br><i>The Vor Game</i><br><i>Cetaganda</i><br><i>Ethan of Athos</i><br><i>Borders of Infinity</i><br>"Labyrinth"<br>"The Borders of Infinity" <br><i>Brothers in Arms</i><br><i>Mirror Dance</i><br><i>Memory</i><br><i>Komarr</i><br><i>A Civil Campaign</i><br>"Winterfair Gifts"<br><i>Diplomatic Immunity</i><br><i>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</i><br><i>CryoBurn</i><br><i>Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Caveats:<br>&nbsp;<br>The novella "Weatherman" is an out-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The Vor Game</i>.

But not this book. Here, Billy's mom issues a few scary warnings about the woods to her son--"Beware! Beware! The Forest of Sin! None come out, but many go in!"--turns her back for a second, and the next thing you know the devil shows up and whispers something to Bobby about wild strawberries. Blammo! Guess where Billy goes--straight to the forbidden forest, of course. At this point, if you are reading the story aloud to your child, you may think there's a parable on the way. But just when you might expect to run into monsters named Lust, Avarice, and Three-Toed Sloth (okay, maybe not Lust), a real monster comes careening along and you realize that this story is just a fairy tale after all--and quite a lovely one at that.<p> <i>The Minpins</i> taps into the powerful, wonderful child's fantasy of discovering a hidden civilization of tiny folk that accepts and honors him or her. The very best part of this fairy tale is the denouement, where Billy receives the gift of nightly escape on the wings of a swan. One of Roald Dahl's only picture books--with fabulously crosshatched pen-and-ink illustrations by Patrick Benson--<i>The Minpins</i> is superb for reading aloud to the three- to eight-year-old set.

At the age of twenty-six he moved to Washington, D.C., and it was there he began to write.

Lee from regaining the strategic initiative in 1864, although the Southern general's defensive operations during May-June of that year are regarded by many as his greatest military accomplishment. It was during this campaign that Grant came to be called "The Butcher" because of the horrendous casualties he was willing to accept as he ordered assault after assault. He did not retreat after suffering tactical defeats in the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Courthouse and Cold Harbor, but continued to push his troops ever closer to the rebel capital of Richmond. Not a formal campaign study, this is a dramatic account told through the eyes of soldiers, civilians and government leaders. One of the elements historian Trudeau dramatizes is the shifting emotional reaction of President Lincoln as he worried whether Grant would prove as faint-hearted as other generals who had faced Lee in the field. When word was brought from Grant that "There is no turning back," the president literally kissed the messenger, for this was probably the most important of several historic turning-points in the four-year Civil War. Illustrations. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.This popularly written account of the initial months of Grant's decisive Virginia campaign against Lee will find a ready audience among Civil War buffs. Done in the episodic, you-are-there style of such writers as Cornelius Ryan, it rests mainly on a host of published first-hand accounts and regimental histories. By 1864 the war in the East had become a test of wills and endurance. How the ordinary soldiers and civilians measured up to that test through 40 days of horrific carnage is the book's main focus. Although devoid of sweeping conclusions and with few notes, the book's presentation of the campaign's strategy and the tactics of individual battles is clear. Excellent for the general reader and libraries of any size.<br><i>- Thomas E.

Refuting critics such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and the "new atheist" crowd, Spufford, a former atheist and Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, argues that Christianity is recognizable, drawing on the deep and deeply ordinary vocabulary of human feeling, satisfying those who believe in it by offering a ruthlessly realistic account of the grown-up dignity of Christian experience.</p><p>Fans of C.

This time her subject is the Cuna Indians, who inhabit the San Blas Islands off the coast of Panama, and the avenue for exploration is the mola, a vibrant cloth panel with embroidered and appliqued designs. Outsiders frame molas as art; Cuna women sew them into blouses. The author's language is often as vivid as the painstakingly stitched, densely hued fabric art; she notes that from the air the San Blas Islands "seem no bigger than jellyfish floating lazily in the shiny turquoise and cobalt blue waters of the Caribbean Sea." Cuna women create the molas; as the author explains in an endnote, the high prices these works fetch from outsiders buttresses the dominant role women have traditionally played in Cuna society. Aided by crisply detailed photographs of molas, Presilla paints a memorable portrait of "women who wear their lives." Ages 7-up. (Oct.) TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE: The Fight for Haiti's Freedom Walter Dean Myers, illus. by Jacob Lawrence. S&amp;S, $16 ISBN 0-689-80126-2 As a young Harlem Renaissance artist, Lawrence's first success was a series of 41 narrative paintings chronicling the life of Haitian activist Toussaint L'Ouverture, who in 1791 led a rebellion against the French planters. Lawrence's stylized tempura art, painted predominantly in muted earth hues, is punctuated by luminous splashes of white and red. His striking compositions recreate the drama of how the self-taught Toussaint became the revolt's leader, organizing workers into "a mighty army of liberation" to abolish slavery on both the French and Spanish sides of the island. They also convey Toussaint's despair in prison, where he died before Haiti's liberation in 1804. The battle scenes are a dynamic clatter of spiky, angular shapes and flying hooves; more quiet panels depict Toussaint studiously drafting battle plans and ships ominously arriving from France. Though Myers (Brown Angels) makes some broad leaps that may puzzle kids, he skillfully presents Toussaint's life story in succinct episodes that correspond to the paintings. His clean, effective text supports Lawrence's more complex and powerful paintings, both urbane and elemental in style. Ages 8-12. (Oct.) FYI: The artist whose paintings illustrate this book is himself the subject of a picture book (reviewed below).<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4^-8. Like Lawrence's <i>Harriet and the Promised Land</i> (1993) and <i>The Great Migration</i> (1993), this book pulls together a stirring series of narrative paintings that tell a powerful story. With the pictures, Myers has written a biography of L'Ouverture and an overview of the struggle he led to free his people from slavery. The paintings were first exhibited in 1940 and are now housed at the Amistad Research Center in New Orleans. Rhythmic and intense, in strong shades of brown and contrasting white, the 41 frames are filled with movement and confrontation. After harsh scenes of plantation slavery, there are battle scenes with people marching and on horseback; in contrast is the desolate view of the captured leader dying alone in a French prison cell. Lawrence's narrative art style has been compared to the patterns of quilting and the vigor of muralist art. There's an immediacy to his storytelling, and this inspiring account of a freedom struggle will move middle-graders and older students as art, history, and biography. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>The New Earth from Above: 365 Days: Revised Edition</h2><p><i>The New Earth From Above: 365 Days </i>is now fully revised and updated.

The whole venture is being filmed for a documentary on World War II and Evans tries to assist the film crew by finding them local people with stories to tell. Little does he realize that resurrecting the past can sometimes mean opening old wounds. After some unhappy confrontations, it is not just the villagers who are upset by the filmmakers. Evans' own life is thrown into turmoil as he discovers his girlfriend Bronwen's past relationship with someone from the film crew.<br><br>Tensions build until one of the filmmakers disappears and is eventually found dead in a nearby slate mine. The case grows more complex as Evans slowly uncovers evidence that the victim had many enemies. In the process Evans also exposes an elaborate World War II scheme to hide paintings from the National Gallery. Do these paintings have something to do with the filmmaker's disappearance? How could he be connected to events that took place over half a century ago? <br><br>With this fifth addition to her critically acclaimed series, Rhys Bowen creates a colorful, page-turning mystery set in two eras against the backdrop of a uniquely appealing small town filled with unforgettable characters. <br></p><p>The descent by a group of egocentric, flamboyant filmmakers on a small town has been the setup for a number of novels and a few movies. Rhys Bowen takes her crack at it with a tidy little story about a group of documentarians who invade a small village in Wales to capture the raising of a sunken German bomber on film. Llanfair is surrounded by abandoned mineshafts, and when the bombastic producer Grantley Smith is found murdered in one of them, Constable Evan Evans, Bowen's series hero, stumbles down more than a few dead ends before he uncovers the motive. Finding evidence of a stash of paintings from the National Gallery that were hidden at the scene of the murder, Evan uncovers a decades-old plot involving art forgery that doesn't really have much to do with the murder except coincidence. It does, however, keep the narrative moving, as does a love affair between the constable and the schoolteacher, who turns out to have been married to one of the filmmakers. All's well that ends well--except, probably, for the unfortunate title punning to which Bowen (<i>Evan Help Us</i>, <i>Evanly Choirs</i>, and so forth) seems addicted. <i>--Jane Adams</i>With Evan Can Wait I wanted to write a book that showed more depth and breadth than the previous books in the series. I wanted to reveal Evan&#39;s emotions and to spread the tale onto a broader canvas. What started off as a brief interview with old Trefor Thomas, who worked in the slate mine during the war, became one of the main threads of the book. Trefor just took over the story and wouldn&#39;t go away. When I had finished I realized that I had two parallel tales--fifty years apart--the stories mirror images of each other to an alarming degree. Very satisfying--for my readers too, I hope.</p><h2>A Happy Death (Cahier, No. 1)</h2><p>A young man searches throughout life for the key to confronting death without fear</p><p>In his first novel, A Happy Death, written when he was in his early twenties and retrieved from his private papers following his death in I960, Albert Camus laid the foundation for The Stranger, focusing in both works on an Algerian clerk who kills a man in cold blood. But he also revealed himself to an extent that he never would in his later fiction. For if A Happy Death is the study of a rule-bound being shattering the fetters of his existence, it is also a remarkably candid portrait of its author as a young man. <br>As the novel follows the protagonist, Patrice Mersault, to his victim's house -- and then, fleeing, in a journey that takes him through stages of exile, hedonism, privation, and death -it gives us a glimpse into the imagination of one of the great writers of the twentieth century. For here is the young Camus himself, in love with the sea and sun, enraptured by women yet disdainful of romantic love, and already formulating the philosophy of action and moral responsibility that would make him central to the thought of our time. <br>Translated from the French by Richard HowardBorn in Algeria in 1913, <b>Albert Camus</b> published <i>The Stranger</i>&#x2014;now one of the most widely read novels of this century&#x2014;in 1942.

More on this on page 132.<br><br> grinder<br> There is something really rewarding about making a simple sausage <br> or pï¿½tï¿½ using a hand-grinder. But if I have a good amount of product <br> to make or am trying to make an emulsification, I like the ease of using an electric grinder. A KitchenAid mixer with a grinder attachment is a good starting place. It can handle a decent amount of meat. However, if you plan on making most of the recipes in this book, any one-horsepower grinder with a steel grinder head is the way to go.&nbsp;<br><br> knives<br> You can do most of the tasks required in the charcuterie chapters of this book with two knives: a deboning knife and a sausage-making knife.<br> The Victorinox 6-inch (15-cm) deboning knife has a nice point <br> on the tip and not too much flex. It will help you easily get the meat off the bones and is great for removing sinew and unwanted fat.&nbsp;<br><br> A sausage-making knife isn&#x2019;t absolutely necessary, but it will make your life a bit easier. It looks like a small paring knife but has thin needlelike points on the opposite edge of the blade. You use this end to puncture your casing if you get any air in it during sausage making.&nbsp;<br> pï¿½tï¿½ molds and slow-cooking vessels<br> I love a solid, good-looking pan with a tight-fitting lid for making <br> pï¿½tï¿½s and slow-cooking meats. Le Creuset is my go-to brand; they aren&#x2019;t cheap and they make you look fancy, but they are also just <br> damn fine cooking vessels.<br> pH meter<br> A pH meter measures the pH level of your product and provides the only way to know for sure whether or not you are making a safe fermented product. If you are making fermented meats, such as salami, this is a small investment to make for serious peace of mind. I use one from Hanna Instruments that is easy to calibrate and simple to read.&nbsp;<br> smoker<br> You can smoke most of the meats in this book using a Weber grill or any charcoal grill with a lid. But if you plan on smoking more than once or twice a year, buy an electric smoker with a heating pad that will burn your chips without you having to stoke the coals. My smoker of choice is the Little Chief.&nbsp;<br> stuffer<br> Although it&#x2019;s possible to stuff sausages using a grinder, I personally don&#x2019;t like to; it takes a bit of time to get the feel for it. For these <br> recipes, I would use a stand-up piston stuffer with a hand crank and <br> a capacity of up to 3<b>1&#x2044;2</b> pounds (1.6 kg) of meat. Far and away the <br> best stuffer of this size is made by a German company called Dick.&nbsp;<br><br> thermometer<br> Buy one that you can calibrate easily. At home, I use a standard <br> thermometer with an adjustable dial. I calibrate it by making an ice <br> and water slurry, then setting the proper temperature as necessary. <br> To calibrate your thermometer, in a large pot, mix ice and water in equal parts, then place the thermometer into the ice slurry; it should read 32ï¿½F (0ï¿½C). If it doesn&#x2019;t, adjust your thermometer until it displays the correct temperature when stuck in the ice bath.&nbsp;<br><br> water activity meter<br> This piece of equipment will let you know you are making a safe dry-cured or fermented product. A water activity meter measures the unbound water content of your product, and the more unbound water you remove from a dry-cured or fermented sausage, the better your chances of reducing spoilage. The industry standard is the Pawkit made by Decagon. This amazing meter will last for a lifetime of meat making. It is only used for dry-cured items.</p><h2>Wandering Home: A Long Walk Across America&#39;s Most Hopeful Landscape: Vermont&#39;s Champlain Valley and New York&#39;s Adirondacks (Crown Journeys)</h2><p>The acclaimed author of <i>The End of Nature</i> takes a three-week walk from his current home in Vermont to his former home in the Adirondacks and reflects on the deep hope he finds in the two landscapes.<br><br>Bill McKibben begins his journey atop Vermont&#x2019;s Mt. Abraham, with a stunning view to the west that introduces us to the broad Champlain Valley of Vermont, the expanse of Lake Champlain, and behind it the towering wall of the Adirondacks. &#x201c;In my experience,&#x201d; McKibben tells us, &#x201c;the world contains no finer blend of soil and rock and water and forest than that found in this scene laid out before me&#x2014;a few just as fine, perhaps, but none finer. And no place where the essential human skills&#x2014;cooperation, husbandry, restraint&#x2014;offer more possibility for competent and graceful inhabitation, for working out the answers that the planet is posing in this age of ecological pinch and social fray.&#x201d;<br><br>The region he traverses offers a fine contrast between diverse forms of human habitation and pure wilderness. On the Vermont side, he visits with old friends who are trying to sustain traditional ways of living on the land and to invent new ones, from wineries to biodiesel. After crossing the lake in a rowboat, he backpacks south for ten days through the vast Adirondack woods. As he walks, he contemplates the questions that he first began to raise in his groundbreaking meditation on climate change, <i>The End of Nature</i>: What constitutes the natural? How much human intervention can a place stand before it loses its essence? What does it mean for a place to be truly wild? <br><br><i>Wandering Home</i> is a wise and hopeful book that enables us to better understand these questions and our place in the natural world. It also represents some of the best nature writing McKibben has ever done.</p><p>Bill McKibben is the author of, most recently, <i>Enough</i> and is a regular contributor to <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, and the<i> New York Times</i>. A scholar-in-residence at Middlebury College, he lives with his wife, the writer Sue Halpern, and their daughter in the mountains above Lake Champlain in Ripton, Vermont. Their house in the Adirondacks is in Johnsburg, New York.Bill McKibben is a nature writer who doesn't dwell on the ecological and biological minutia of plants and animals. For him, a walk through the woods is simply a chance to enjoy nature, even if he doesn't always remember which plant is which and the scientific names of birds. That sense of joy is reflected in his writing. This book chronicles a three-week walk from his current home in Vermont to his former home in the Adirondacks. Along the way, he talks about the natural world, man's influence on that world, and the potential path for both to follow. He describes encounters with dozens of interesting people, giving the book the feel of a good travelogue. Michael Prichard's crisp, clear diction is easy to understand. He varies the pacing effectively and uses pauses dramatically to enhance the author's points.

With a dreamlike power, this wickedly seductive entity draws us through twilight paths, telling a chilling and hypnotic story of spiritual aspiration and passion.From the day her first Vampire Chronicle was published, critics and readers - readers by the hundreds of thousands - have been mesmerized by the writings of Anne Rice. And with the publication of The Witching Hour, she created for us yet another world and legend, and both the chorus of praise (see back of jacket) and the multitudes of her readers once more increased. Now, in her new novel, Anne Rice brings us again - even more magically - into the midst of the dynasty of witches she introduced in The Witching Hour. At the center: the brilliant and beautiful Rowan Mayfair, queen of the coven, and Lasher, the darkly compelling demon whom she finds irresistible and from whose evil spell and vision she must now flee. She takes with her their terrifying and exquisite child, one of &#34;a brood of children born knowing, able to stand and talk on the first day&#34;. Rowan&#39;s attempt to escape Lasher and his pursuit of her and their child are at the heart of this extraordinary saga. It is a novel that moves around the globe, backward and forward through time, and between the human and demonic worlds. Its many voices - of women, of men, of demons and angels, present and past - haunt and enchant us. With a dreamlike power, the novel draws us through twilight paths, telling a chillingly hypnotic story of occult and spiritual aspirations and passion.</p><h2>Eye and Brain</h2><p><p>Since the publication of the first edition in 1966, <i>Eye and Brain</i> has established itself worldwide as an essential introduction to the basic phenomena of visual perception. Richard Gregory offers clear explanations of how we see brightness, movement, color, and objects, and he explores the phenomena of visual illusions to establish principles about how perception normally works and why it sometimes fails.</p><p>Illusion continues to be a major theme in the book, which provides a comprehensive classification system. There are also sections on what babies see and how they learn to see, on motion perception, the relationship between vision and consciousness, and on the impact of new brain imaging techniques.</p></p><p><b>Richard L. Gregory</b> (1923&#x2013;2010) was a distinguished British psychologist and emeritus professor of neuropsychology at the University of Bristol."[A] hugely influential book. . . . It stands as the essential guide to Gregory's framework for perception, but also to a whole range of visual demonstrations, illusions, and puzzles that will have you captivated long after you have finished."<b>---Iain D. Gilchrist, <i>Perception</i></b><br><br>"An excellent introduction to the psychology of vision. It presents what we know, what we don't know, and what we think.

For many years, English teachers have been fond of telling students that "adjectives are the enemy of nouns, and adverbs are the enemy of everything else."</p><p>While it's still advisable to heed your English teacher's advice on most other matters, <em>The Highly Selective Dictionary of Golden Adjectives for the Extraordinarily Literate</em> proves that breaking certain rules can make written and spoken language that much livelier, adding much-needed color, style, and adornment.

Pop songs were written about him. Women whom he had never met offered to leave their husbands for him. The gigantic peppermills brandished in Parisian restaurants became known, for reasons people at the time could only hint at, as "Rubirosas."</p><p>Porfirio Rubirosa was the last great playboy: the rouï¿½ par excellence, a symbol of powerful masculinity, ubiquity, and easy-come-easy-go money.</p><p>"Work?" he shot back at an interviewer, scandalized at being asked what he did with his days. "It's impossible for me to work. I just don't have the time."</p><p>His natural habitat was the polo field, the nightclub, the Formula One racecourse, the bedroom.</p><p>He had an eye for beautiful women, particularly when they came with great wealth: He managed to marry in turn two of the richest women on the planet. Rumor had him bedding hundreds of famous and infamous women, including Christina Onassis, Eva Perï¿½n, and Zsa Zsa Gabor, who gleefully posed for paparazzi after he had blacked her eye in a fit of jealousy on the eve of <em>his</em> marriage to another woman.</p><p>But he was a man's man, too, a notable polo player and race-car driver with a gift for friendship, chumming around with the likes of Joe Kennedy, Frank Sinatra, Oleg Cassini, Aly Khan, and King Farouk.</p><p>When above-board, heiress-type income was scarce, he diverted himself with jewel-thievery, shadowy diplomatic errands, and any other illicit scam that came his way.</p><p>Whatever legitimate power he wielded came to him from the hands of Rafael Trujillo, one of the most bloodthirstily power-mad dictators the New World has ever seen. A nation quivered at Trujillo's name for decades, yet Rubi flouted his strictures without concern, as if Trujillo's iron grip could never crush him. And he was right.</p><p>When Rubi died at the age of fifty-six, wrapping his sports car around a tree in the Bois de Boulogne, an era went with him -- of white dinner jackets at El Morocco; of celebrity for its own sake when this was still a novelty; of glamour before it was available to the masses.</p><p>In <strong>The Last Playboy</strong>, <strong>Shawn Levy</strong> brings Rubi's giddy, hedonistic story to Technicolor life.</p></p><p><p><strong>Shawn Levy</strong> is the film critic of <em>The Oregonian</em> and the author of the critically acclaimed cultural histories <strong>Rat Pack Confidential</strong> and <strong>Ready, Steady, Go!;</strong> and <strong>King of Comedy</strong>, a biography of Jerry Lewis. He lives in Portland, Oregon.</p>Even readers who find the idea of a "playboy" somewhat questionable won't be able to put down Levy's biography of Porfirio Rubirosa (1909&#x2013; 1965). For one thing, there's delicious gossip: the women he courted (Eartha Kitt, Zsa Zsa Gabor), the men he prowled with (Prince Aly Khan, Sinatra, the Kennedys) and the fabulously wealthy women he married (Barbara Hutton, Doris Duke). There's also the story of his infamous penis&#x2014;Doris Duke described it as "six inches in circumference... much like the last foot of a Louisville Slugger baseball bat with the consistency of a not completely inflated volleyball." Plus, there's sports-car racing, polo ponies and nonstop nightclubbing. But Levy, film critic for the <i>Portland Oregonian</i>, goes beyond the glitz to see Rubirosa as a product of a particular time and place: dictator Trujillo's Dominican Republic. Like many Trujillo intimates, Rubirosa was well paid for his loyalty, not his labor. By the 1960s, when Rubirosa crashed his Ferrari in Paris's Bois de Boulogne, he was an anachronism&#x2014;at that point, even wealthy men were trying to have careers of some sort. All Rubi knew was how to enjoy himself, so this bubbly bio is a perfect tribute. Photos. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While satisfying the need for scientific accuracy, the authors have produced a compelling treatise for any reader who is truly interested in understanding the depth of their relationship with water. What do the authors mean when they refer to the New Science of Water? The book explains many of water&#39;s unique properties by examining its liquid crystalline molecular structure. But don&#39;t worry . . . the author&#39;s have kept the lay reader in mind as they explain complex subjects in easy-to-understand language. Dancing with Water is the long-needed reference, providing credibility for many ideas and practices that have long been viewed with skepticism. It discusses the memory-retentive ability of liquid crystalline water; also its ability to transmit energy and information. The book provides insight into the effects of electromagnetic fields, crystals, salts, and the importance of hydrogen in water. But the true beauty of Dancing with Water is reflected in its format - and in its graceful delivery - much like water itself. It is a guide, intended to educate and enlighten the reader. But it is much more. Part I lays the foundation and the scientific basis; Part II provides instructions so that anyone can naturally treat, structure, enhance, and revitalize their water. Dancing with Water will open your eyes and it will introduce you to your partner in life. Then it will take you to the dance floor and show you the steps of the dance. Whether you are a water enthusiast, a health practitioner, a scientist, or a lover of the natural sciences, Dancing with Water will touch your soul and it will guide you as you enter a unique and inspiring new relationship with water.</p><p></p><h2>Agatha Christie: Five Complete Miss Marple Novels (Avenel Suspense Classics)</h2><p>A collection of engrossing Miss Marple mysteries include an assortment of characters from angry in-laws to a glamorous actress</p><p></p><h2>Nir!

This 25th anniversary edition includes, in addition to the original story, <i>Arthur's Nose</i>, a scrapbook of fun facts, photos, and letters all about the evolution of Arthur over the years. Readers can compare photos of author Marc Brown's family with pictures of Arthur and his family. (Note the spooky similarity between Brown's sister, Bonnie, and Arthur's sister, D.W.--Brown doesn't deny it!). In a letter to his fans, Brown describes how Arthur came to be, and how he has developed over the years. A special illustrated section demonstrates just how much this friendly fellow's nose has changed, from a long, droopy, aardvarky nose in 1976, gradually shortening over the years to his nearly nonexistent schnoz today. Arthur has also acquired glasses and a much sunnier disposition over the last quarter century.<p> In <i>Arthur's Nose</i>, first grader Arthur decides that he doesn't like his nose. He goes to the rhinologist to change it, but ultimately decides, to the relief of his friends and family, "I'm just not me without my nose!" Luckily for readers today, Arthur is still Arthur, even without the original elongated proboscis. Fans of <i>Arthur's First Kiss</i>, <i>Arthur Accused!</i>, <i>Arthur and the Crunch Cereal Contest</i>, and the many other Arthur titles, will be thrilled to get a peek behind the scenes in this very special edition. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Marc Brown, who was born in Erie, Pennsylvania in 1946, received great encouragement and support from his grandmother and uncle. Inspired by the books of Maurice Sendak, Brown decided to pursue his ambition of becoming an illustrator. After receiving a B.F.A. in painting from the Cleveland Institute of Art, he worked as a TV art director, a professor of mechanical drawing, and a freelance illustrator, before becoming a writer. In his books, he addresses the fears and problems which children face and events like friendship, family, school and pets. For his illustrations, Brown uses pencil with watercolor on a variety of papers to achieve different visual effects. The &#34;Arthur&#34; series, about the everyday adventures of a lovable aardvark, began in 1976 and continues to this day with 25 titles published. Brown has also created other series such as the &#34;Rhymes&#34; series, and the nonfiction &#34;Dinosaur&#34; series, which conveys messages of do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. These series, like the stories of Arthur, hold the attention of young children while transporting their imaginations on magical journeys.</p><h2>Cake Wrecks: When Professional Cakes Go Hilariously Wrong</h2><p>Have your cake and laugh at it, too, with the sweet treat known as <i>Cake Wrecks: When Professional Cakes Go Hilariously Wrong</i>.

However sad, Joyce&#x2019;s messages&#x2014;about the limitations of time and control, the failures of adults and the fears of children, and our responsibility for our own imprisonment and freedom&#x2014;have a gentle ring of truth to them.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There is a poignancy to Joyce&#x2019;s narrative that makes for her most memorable writing.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;NPR&#x2019;s <i>All Things Considered</i></b></p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Rachel Joyce</b></p> <p><b><i>The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry</i> began as a radio play and then developed into the novel it is today after many years of writing and revising. But <i>Perfect</i> was written within a shorter space of time. How did your process differ in writing the two novels? </b></p> <p>The truth is, I have been thinking about <i>Perfect</i> for even longer than <i>The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry</i>. The idea about the cost of perfection and an accident that changes everything, as well as the central characters, have all been loitering in my head for many years. I could always see Byron and Diana and I knew I needed to find out more about who they were and what happened to them. Sometimes I have even tried fitting them into other stories, but it never felt right because this is where they belong. </p> <p>As with most things, the story has grown over time. New characters have stepped in. Things I couldn&#x2019;t understand have become clearer. I have played with different versions until I found this one. It was only as I began to write it this time around, for instance, that it dawned on me that it wasn&#x2019;t a contemporary story and neither was it an urban one. It was only this time, too, that I thought about splitting the story between two tenses and two periods in time. </p> <p>Otherwise, the writing process was very similar with both books. I sat here every day and I wrote and rewrote and rewrote. </p> <p><b>How much of the novel is based on real places and people? </b></p> <p>The moor setting is fictitious. But &#x2013; as with Harold Fry&#x2019;s story &#x2013; I stepped out of our house and drew on what I saw. I am lucky enough to live on the brow of a valley. I write about the things I see when I look out of my writing shed or walk through the fields. It&#x2019;s the same with characters. I write about people I glimpse and then I imagine the rest. I think I tend to find people in my head that I want to explore and maybe all of them have an element or two of me in them. I don&#x2019;t know. In researching the character of Jim, for instance, I spoke to a number of people about OCD and whilst it is not a condition I&#x2019;ve experienced, it reminded me of other things I&#x2019;ve felt that had similar beginnings or resonances. For me, writing is about finding the links between myself and the outside world. It&#x2019;s a way of better understanding. </p> <p><b>You have written that <i>Harold Fry</i> was inspired in part by your father. Was there someone or something specific that compelled you to write <i>Perfect</i>?</b></p> <p>It is difficult for me to know why I choose to write certain stories. Often I don&#x2019;t understand until many years later. But I do remember vividly when the first nugget of this story came to me. It was just over twelve years ago, after the birth of my third child, and I was driving my oldest daughter to school. My second daughter was telling me she was hungry, the baby was crying, and on the passenger seat beside me was the plate of cakes I had got up at dawn to make for the very competitive children&#x2019;s bake stall. I was driving slowly. Traffic was heavy. I had barely slept for days. And then I had one of those moments when you lift out of yourself, when you see your life from a new perspective, and it occurred to me that if I made a mistake, if someone ran into the road, if anything unexpected happened, I did not have the energy, the space, the wherewithal, the presence of mind even, to deal with it. I was stretched as far as I could go. I began writing the story as soon as I got home.</p><b>Rachel Joyce</b> is the author of the international bestseller <i>The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry</i>.

Americans swallow vitamins pills by the millions, but do they do more harm than good as detractors claim? Vitamin pills are the best health insurance that one can buy. Being an advocate of dietary supplementation, too often I would receive phone calls from people that their health conditions weren&#39;t improving, in fact, were getting worse, after they began taking vitamins. I wondered why vitamin pills weren&#39;t always living up to their promise? Upon investigation, I found most multivitamins were poorly formulated. They were impotent, unbalanced and incomplete. Most brands either followed the ridiculous daily allowance (RDA) or attempted to lure consumers by providing more and more milligrams of vitamins and minerals. Some brands showcased certain nutrients but provided trivial doses. The fine print on multivitamin labels is often beyond consumer understanding. Vitamin pills buyers often pay for nutrients that are inferior, like inorganic selenium, synthetically made vitamin E, and poorly-absorbed forms of magnesium and vitamin B12. The list of requirements for a well-designed multivitamin began to develop. I came up with about 25 important markers to evaluate multivitamins. A rating form was developed so consumers could evaluate their own multivitamins. It&#39;s at the back of the book. If you are the type of consumer who wants to know you are doing the right thing when you take vitamin pills. If you want to check the references and studies before you buy a multi. If you want a multivitamin that delivers on its promise to promote health and longevity, then this book is worth the read.</p><p></p><h2>O Rugged Land of Gold</h2><p>Share the triumph of a woman-alone, injured, pregnant-on a remote Alaskan island and how she came through a long winter with grit and determination.

Kurt has ambitions as a novelist, and Bernard is working on a series of cutting-edge weather-control experiments meant to make deserts bloom and farmers flourish.</p><p>While Kurt writes zippy press releases, Bernard builds silver-iodide generators and attacks clouds with dry ice. His experiments attract the attention of the government; weather proved a decisive factor in World War II, and if the military can control the clouds, fog, and snow, they can fly more bombing missions. Maybe weather will even be the "New Super Weapon." But when the army takes charge of his cloud-seeding project (dubbed Project Cirrus), Bernard begins to have misgivings about the harmful uses of his inventions, not to mention the evidence that they are causing alarming changes in the atmosphere.</p><p>In a fascinating cultural history, Ginger Strand chronicles the intersection of these brothers' lives at a time when the possibilities of science seemed infinite. As the Cold War looms, Bernard's struggle for integrity plays out in Kurt's evolving writing style. <i>The Brothers Vonnegut</i> reveals how science's ability to influence the natural world also influenced one of our most inventive novelists.</p></p><p><p><b>Ginger Strand</b> is the author of three previous books, including <i>Killer on the Road: Violence and the American Interstate</i>.
